Englishmen come to explore and settle the new world. There they find natives who are curious about their "firesticks" and strange customs. One Englishman, John Smith, is captured by the natives, and begins to learn their customs and beliefs. As Smith spends more time with them, specifically Pocahontas, he realizes that the white man may not be meant for the new world.::Jason Parker and Sean Kilby <gestalt@ix.netcom.com>
