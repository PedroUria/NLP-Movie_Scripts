This was the pilot to the series. A man and a woman who are lovers commit a murder. Eventually it is revealed that the victim is the father and husband of the two who killed him. J.L. McCabe, the tough district attorney known as "The Fatman", suspects them right away but unfortunately has no evidence, so he sends his ace investigator, Jake Styles to get the evidence. But it won't be easy cause these two covered their tracks very well.::<rcs0411@yahoo.com>
