This making-of piece mixes movie clips, behind the scenes material, and interviews with Adrian Lyne, Richard Gere, Diane Lane, Olivier Martinez, and producer G. Mac Brown. We already heard some of the information during the commentaries, but "Remember" provides a decent little synopsis of the topics. The shots from the set help complement the narration and make this a quick but efficient and moderately useful program.
