Marian and her husband Seth have set out west where they plan to start a family and open an apothecary. During their travels things have taken a turn for the worse as they have lost their mules, ruined their stagecoach and used up most of their supplies. Exhausted and starving, Seth goes out to hunt one day and does not return, leaving Marian to herself. As Marian waits for Seth to return, a lone Indian encroaches upon their camp.::Sean Eisele
