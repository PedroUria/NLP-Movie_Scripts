Charles Joyce (also known as Chuck) joined the navy and sailed to various locations throughout Western Europe, including Scotland, where he met Catrina Nicholson (also known as Babs) and fell in love with her. However, Chuck was forced to return to Canada and left his Scottish girlfriend; in order to secure the relationship, Chuck sent an engagement ring in a Cracker Jack box to Babs and the two met up later and were married.::Anonymous
