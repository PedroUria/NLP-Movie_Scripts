His plans are hijacked when Sharon invites her two best girlfriends, Neve (Chloe Bridges) and Heather (Haley Ramm), and their dates along on the perfect evening, but things only get worse. When all three are deserted by their dates at the beginning of prom, the trio go back out to their limo, where the driver has cleaned out the mini bar and takes them on a wild ride that lands them in a holding cell and ends with them crashing another school's prom. Along the way, they're held at gunpoint in the woods by Satanists, make a few discoveries about their respective dates, and end up having the best prom ever after all.::Novel deVice
