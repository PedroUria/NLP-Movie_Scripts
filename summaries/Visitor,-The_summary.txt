This is the story of Ariel Lambert, a twenty year old, who is advised to rest in a quiet place after a psychiatric episode. He moves together with his mother and sister to Villa Mar, small seaside resort, which is practically deserted at that time of the year. Slowly, Ariel discovers that children go into a house nearby, (which is supposed to be derelict) and they never come out again. Is this happening for real? Or is it only a figment of Ariel's sick mind? There will be only one way to find out: Ariel will have to go into the house himself::Jon Medek
