In 1882, Joseph and Elizabeth Cooley head west to reunite with Elizabeth's family and are stranded in a logging camp just outside Tucson. Then, a wounded Indian stumbles into their camp and they must defend him against his would-be killer - Doc Holliday. Elizabeth considers Doc a stone-cold killer but, during the course of their tense standoff, she comes to find that this courtly, ailing man has a surprisingly well-honed sense of justice, frontier-style.::Jiilo_Kim
