Players enter one-on-one matches against brawlers and grapplers from around the world, using combat techniques from Boxing, Kickboxing, Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, Wrestling, and Judo styles and disciplines. The game is built on a new engine, designed to support accurate collision detection and realistic fighting action that represents the real-life styles of UFC's star fighters, more than 75 of whom are featured. Players can lead their favorite fighter to the Hall of Fame though an extensive single-player Career mode, or design their own combatant from scratch with the game's Create-A-Fighter system.::T.J.
