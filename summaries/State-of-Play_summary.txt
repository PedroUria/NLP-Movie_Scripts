This making-of documentary includes appearances by most of the major cast members and behind-the-scenes personnel, but director Kevin Macdonald dominates the piece, and his charisma and enthusiasm help maintain interest. The filmmaker discusses how he re-imagined the BBC miniseries on which the project is based, and how almost every fine actor in Hollywood sought a part in the picture. We also learn about the challenges of shooting on location in Washington, D.C., the mountain of pre-production work the film required, the meticulous construction of the massive newsroom set, and the different styles of cinematography that were employed.
