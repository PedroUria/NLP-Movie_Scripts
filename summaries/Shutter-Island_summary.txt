A captivating piece, which only should be viewed after you watch the movie. All the principal actors join Scorsese to discuss the director's style (Ben Kingsley calls him "a painter"), his close collaboration with the cast, and the unique challenges the script posed to performers. Dennis Lehane, upon whose novel the film is based, shares his perspective, as well as his reasoning behind writing the book, while Scorsese discusses his musical philosophy for the picture, and the difficulties he faced during shooting so 'Shutter Island' could hold up upon subsequent viewings. Articulate comments abound in this well-produced and nicely paced piece.
