To avoid a complicated situation, twin brothers trade their lives for a weekend. They first thought they could deceive everyone until they realize they were actually manipulated in a far more unusual and sordid way. Both themes of unsettled identity and manipulation definitely give a new dimension to the main title 'ALTER EGO'. Each character will explore their 'other selves' and will have to settle between duality for a few of them and ubiquity for others.::Anonymous
