The episode started with the models entering the model house. After settling in, they received their very first Georgina Mail. They met Georgina and Joey as they evaluated the girls' runway walks. Barbara and Monika got Georgina and Joey's acclamation while Melissa struggled to impress and create a first impression. The judges were worried about Rani's walk. Nervous about their walks, the girls practiced on the runway in the penthouse, with Gani mentoring some of the girls. The day after, they met Marina Fairfax from Storm Model Management and they were told that they were going to be walking on a runway with a turntable at the end. Although most of the girls struggled; mainly Shareeta, Rani and Melissa - Barbara and Monika remained to excel on the runway. Marina declared Barbara as the winner of the challenge, who received a set of clothes from Zalora as her prize. Challenge winner: Barbara Katsuki For their first photo shoot, they were told that they would be doing a swimwear shoot. Amanda, Barbara, Gani and Monika excelled, while Shareeta, Melissa and Rani struggled. At panel, most of the girls received mixed feedback for their shots. Amanda, Barbara, Gani, Monika, and Tahlia received favorable reviews of their shots, especially Amanda, who received praises from the judges as they didn't expect her to pull off that great of a shot.
