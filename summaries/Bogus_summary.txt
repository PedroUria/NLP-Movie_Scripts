Simone and Sipowicz investigate the sexual assault of a mentally disabled 17-year-old schoolgirl, after her domineering and verbally abusive mother reports it. They try to persuade her to press charges against the two assailants. One of the assailants is a wealthy teen from an exclusive prep school, and who is the son of the cowardly and corrupt Councilman Paul Manos... whom the detectives had problems with the previous year. Meanwhile, a strange man, that Sipowicz had committed to Bellevue mental hospital four years ago, appears at the station and causes a minor scene... trying to get someone to listen to him about a problem he now has. Elsewhere, Russell continues her undercover work and relationship with Jimmy, who nearly blows her cover when Medavoy meets with her in the open. Jimmy begins to show off his true psychopath face when he beats up a skater who bumps into him while roller-blading at Washington Square.::matt-282
