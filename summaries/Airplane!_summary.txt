Les has long been jealous that WPIG has the only traffic news helicopter in Cincinnati, such a helicopter which Andy had promised Les when he first got hired, which has yet to materialize, and which Andy now admits won't. As such, Les hires penny-pinching crop duster Buddy Barker to fly him over the skies of Cincinnati in his biplane so that Les can report the traffic live. This act, which Les didn't clear with either Mr. Carlson or Andy, has him literally grounded and figuratively chained to his desk by Mr. Carlson, in the station not being able to handle the liability if something were to happen, but arguably more important such a stunt making the station look foolish. Les is still determined to make it into the skies the next day, Veterans Day (formerly known as Armistice Day) as he anticipates the traffic will be gridlock as Cincinnati residents make their way to the parades and other Veterans Day events. As Les hires Buddy for another fly over the city on the national holiday, Buddy's own military history and his slightly off-kilter mentality lead to not only Les and Buddy, but also the station employees and the Cincinnati populace in general looking for the true meaning of the holiday.::Huggo
