Biosyn is not featured in the Game Boy version. The player controls Grant, whose vehicle at Jurassic Park has stopped functioning as the result of an intentional power outage. Grant moves through a rain forest and later takes a raft down a river, where he encounters aquatic reptiles. Grant ultimately reaches Jurassic Park's headquarters, where most of the power remains off. The Game Boy version is also a side-scroller, played across four zones on different parts of the island. A common quest requires the player to collect magnetic card keys to open security gates. Enemies include raptors and pterosaurs. The game also features several boss enemies, including a Triceratops.::Cameron Iacono
