Now Klaus's original family's coffins are open, he's supplanted as family head by their sorceress-maker, mother Esther, who holds a grand ball in their splendidly restored mansion. Invitations with gifts and where needed other persuades go to the Salavtore brothers, Alaric, Matt, Caroline and especially Elena, who is asked for a private meeting. After Stefan prevents Damon from stopping her, she learns that Esther, aided by son Finn, needs Doppleganger blood to put a fatal spell on her children, the others being an 'abomination' except Elijah, firstly binding their fate. Tyler prepares his return.::KGF Vissers
