Ida's birthday is approaching, and without Martin around, she says she doesn't want a big fuss, although she does invite Rhoda, Brenda and Benny to spend it with her at her place in the Bronx. Among the gifts that Ida receives is one shipped to her from Martin, it being a sound movie projector complete with a film showing Martin and his latest goings-on in Florida. Ida is happy to see Martin, if only on film, and has bittersweet feelings about seeing how happy and content he seems to be. Ida receives an unexpected last minute present in the form of Martin himself, who has come home, he feeling that her birthday was the best time he could have made the move back for everyone concerned. But rather than be happy to see her husband in the flesh again, Ida does not want to see or talk to him, at least not yet, which places Martin in a difficult situation. Rhoda and Brenda try to convince their mother to at least talk to him, which if she does may reveal what she is truly feeling about her husband and their marriage at this stage in their life.::Huggo
