Stuart Boyle, who was at school with Jeff, is puzzled by a letter supposedly from his father - who has been dead for some years - asking him to meet him at the Boyle family's department store, which closed when the old man died. He meets Jeannie at the store but it has been taken over by murderous shop window dummies who threaten them. Jeff and Marty arrive to save them but have a disagreement which ends up with Marty getting stuck in a limbo inhabited by ghosts who have fallen out with their nearest and dearest and who try to prevent him from getting back to the store to save his friends.::don @ minifie-1
