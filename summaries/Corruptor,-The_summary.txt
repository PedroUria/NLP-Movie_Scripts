Plenty of cast & crew interviews mixed in with on-set footage, the complete uncut car chase and a couple of trailers inform us on how this film was made and subsequently released. In no way promotional for the film, this documentary shows us some of the real frustrations of getting a feature-film made.::Rhyl Donnelly
