Capoeira has become one of Brazil's top national sports and it has become firmly established in the U.S. Capoeira is a journey that occurs in many levels the individual, the sub-groups that exist due to length involved, the whole group, and the entire evolution of Capoeira. There is no place where growth stops, no place where we are done on this journey. Because there is no place where it ends, there is also no concrete expectations of where each of us are along the journey. The CBT Batizado 2007 showcases the accomplishments of the CBT students, as well as, a beautiful show of talents by Capoeira Brasil members and Mestres from around the world.::Deacon78
