On the full moon of Hope's first double digit birthday, she is gifted with knowledge of her mermaid heritage. Hope will further her mermaid education requirements by attending The School of Mermaidology and Neptunism, an enchanted school for merchildren. On the eve of Hope's 18th birthday, she must choose to reside with the merpeople or remain human for life.::Marilyn Swick
