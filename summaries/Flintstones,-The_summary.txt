When the Flintstones and the Rubbles pay a visit to the science exhibit, they meet Professor Einstone who's been working on a lot of wacky inventions for many years, but little does he know that while he was away, his inventions were already invented by other people. The Flintstones show him all the wacky inventions they use everyday: pedal cars, elephant vacuum cleaners, monkey juke boxes, dino cranes, clamshell shavers, lobster lawn mowers, Fred's wacky concoctions like his soft drink: 412 Up, the Barney Copter (a.k.a The Flintstone Flyer), Barney's race car, bird cameras, pterydactal movie screens, and many, many more!::Dylan Self <robocoptng986127@aol.com>
