There's a muscle-car war brewing in Detroit these days. Right as the handling-champion Z/28 goes out of production, Ford delivers a Shelby-badged suckerpunch with a flat-plane-crank V8, MR dampers, and carbon fiber wheels. Head 2 Head host Jason Cammisa takes the two through a series of challenges: first, some canyon carving to see which car is better on the road. Then, a dyno shootout: can the GT350R's 5.2-liter Voodoo make more power than the venerable 7.0-liter LS7? And then, it's onto Chuckwalla Valley Raceway where Jason and racecar driver Randy Pobst find out not only which one is faster around the track, but which car handles best.
