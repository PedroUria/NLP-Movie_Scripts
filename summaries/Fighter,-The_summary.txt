What better way to kick off the year 2010 than by playing Street Fighter 2010? The Nerd strives to beat this ridiculously hard game that has nothing to do with the Street Fighter series, and as a bonus, he plays not only the Sega Saturn adaptation of the Street Fighter movie, but he actually manages to find and play the original Street Fighter game! And as you might expect, they all suck.::J.D. Nerd
