Divided in two segments: "Casting" (13 minutes) mixes behind the scenes shots, movie clips, and interviews with director Phil Alden Robinson, screenwriter Daniel Pyne, producer Mace Neufeld, and actors Ben Affleck, Live Schreiber, Bridget Moynahan, James Cromwell, Morgan Freeman, Ciaran Hinds and Alan Bates. We get some notes about how the actors came to the film and also their work on the set. "Production" (17 minutes) follows the same framework as "Casting". It includes interviews with producer Mace Neufeld, director Phil Alden Robinson, cinematographer John Lindley, screenwriter Daniel Pyne, actors Morgan Freeman, Ben Affleck, Alan Bates, Bridget Moynahan, James Cromwell and Liev Schreiber, and CIA public affairs officer Chase Brandon. It covers the adaptation of the novel, the reworking of the franchise to accommodate Affleck's age, reactions to the film in the post-September 11 world, and a number of production anecdotes.
