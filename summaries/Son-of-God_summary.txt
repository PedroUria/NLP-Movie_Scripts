Sons of God is not just a film. It's a unique insight into a world where faith and love are no longer unattainable concepts - but actualized reality. Inexplicable miracles. Lives radically transformed. Sons and daughters living lives abandoned to their God. Dutch filmmaker Immanuel Hazeleger traveled the world to capture a story that inspires, brings hope and might even make God a bit more accessible.::Immanuel Hazeleger
