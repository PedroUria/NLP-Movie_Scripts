Natalia is a young Spanish woman who arrives in Mexico City, invited by Esteban, her boyfriend. However, due to work, he is absent, but his friends, Ana and Sofia, convince Natalia to travel to Valeria's house which is out of town, as a sort of bachelorette party. What starts out as an innocent comedy becomes an unusual and violent drama that questions the nature of power, the animality of our species, and the transposition of gender roles.::Anonymous
