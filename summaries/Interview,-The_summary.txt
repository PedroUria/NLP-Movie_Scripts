A prison interrogation room is the setting as a reporter interviews an ex-contract killer for TV broadcast. They discuss life and the human experience, as we build toward the reveal of a greater truth. We view the piece through the reporter's own cameras, in a cinema verite styled piece. The film documents the thoughts of a man who killed to live, his philosophy on life and why he made the decisions he did, all while the reporter attempts to find his humanity.
