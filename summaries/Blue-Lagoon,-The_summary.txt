This 'making of...' documentary's subject is the remake of The Blue Lagoon (1980). The plot synopsis has two children marooned on a deserted island where they grow up into young adults. Despite the simple story and small primary cast, director Randal Kleiser has logistical challenges in location shooting on a remote island in Fiji. He decided to remake the movie after reading the original source material, a 1918 novel. The process of casting the two young lead actors Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields is discussed, they who compare their own growing up experiences to that of their characters. Location filming afforded the use of native Fijians, both in playing native characters on screen, as well as providing lessons on island life such as that the characters go through. But the location also provides a quick escape for some fun and relaxation while not filming.::Huggo
