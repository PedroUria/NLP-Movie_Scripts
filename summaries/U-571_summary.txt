This making-of piece includes another Mostow interview, this time with Vice Admiral Patrick Hannifin. The WWII veteran - who also was "technical advisor" for the movie - discusses his experiences during the war and gives a short but solid overview of the entire experience. It's an interesting and valuable program.
