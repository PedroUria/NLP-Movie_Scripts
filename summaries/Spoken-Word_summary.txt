Televising a Revolution of Spoken Word from Detroit calls attention to the activism of Detroit's spoken word (performance poets), page poets, slam poets, and hip hop poets. Poets and activists define what is poetry, discuss types of poets, the role of revolutionary poets, describe Detroit poets' contribution to the literary community, and offer advise to future poets.::Anonymous
