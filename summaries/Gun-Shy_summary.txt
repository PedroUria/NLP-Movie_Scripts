"The Good Samaritan " refers to a helpful neighbor who is shot and killed by the rapist of his neighbor when he comes to check on her. The only clue? A semen sample with no suspect. This 1989 case in New York goes cold until another reported rape in 2001 in Colorado produces a matching sample. NY detectives must travel to Junction City, KS and two little towns in Colorado to catch a killer. In the second segment, a "Gun Shy" woman in Santa Clara, California, is shot in what her husband calls an accident. Thanks to a victim support group, a persistent brother and a detective's study of crime photos which allows reconstruction of the incident, justice is done after more than a dozen years.::jeaneva
