Divided into two teams, celebrities are blindfolded, and dropped into some of the most remote locations on earth. With no food, no map, and no help, they must make their way through unforgiving landscapes in a race to find civilization. A daily radio message from the show's host is their only indication as to how far they've gone. Each week, the losing team faces an elimination challenge, until only four contestants remain. In the final it's every man for himself: there can be only one winner. Dropped into desert, jungle, mountains and snow. Stunning landscapes; brutal environments. This is reality television at its most authentic.
