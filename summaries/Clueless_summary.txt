When their tent is blown away in a storm the Chuckle Brothers go to a hotel where, unbeknown to them, a Murder Mystery Weekend is taking place and they are mistaken for participants representing the police. As the guests and staff 'die', one by one, leaving the message, "You're Next",scrawled on a mirror, the brothers take it all very literally and, even when the 'corpses' come back to life to explain what has been happening, Paul and Barry remain clueless Chuckles.::don @ minifie-1
