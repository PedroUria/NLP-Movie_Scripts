This film is about Alexander Vutimski - one of the most confessional and tragic Bulgarian poets, who passed away in the age of 24. He, who foreboded his forthcoming end, and captured with the perspicacity of a clairvoyant the spirit of totalitarian times that came to reign only a year after his death, aristocratic to the marrow of his bones, he flashed thunder-like but is never to be forgotten.::Georgi Djulgerov <georgidjul1943@gmail.com>
