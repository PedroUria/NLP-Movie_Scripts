On the 10th of September 2013, a Transnet pipeline was ruptured in KZN, spilling hundreds of thousands of litres of unrefined petrol into the adjoining wetland, which feeds the Mooiriver. This has devastating ecological consequences for the wetland system which is of high conservation significance and harbours endangered species such as the Blue Crane and endemic frog and butterfly species. Reports have shown large vegetation die off with suspected fauna mortalities to follow. The damage looks to be irreversible and it is expected that much wetland sediment will be removed for offsite treatment resulting in non-existent wetland that will have to be recreated. Who is responsible for this tragedy and who is going to pay for the clean-up which could run into millions of rands? How and why was the pipeline breached? Bonne investigates these questions.::Bonne de Bod
