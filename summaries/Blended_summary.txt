Love, career, wealth and family. Varying from their mid-twenties to mid-forties, the cast of BIWB is ready to showcase their vulnerabilities, struggles, strengths and successes to a worldwide audience. To show how a community of women can assist each other via mentorship, inspiration and brutal honesty on becoming and maintaining their strengths. As they tackle dating, divorce, pregnancy and motherhood, these women bond and fight and then bond all over again, pushing each other forward.
