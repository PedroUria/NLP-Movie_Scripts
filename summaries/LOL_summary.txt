The iconic "School Series" that ran from 1999-2002 gets a serious reboot more than ten years later. This new installment features a cast of millenials engaging with contemporary high school life, concerns and dreams. Jang Na Ra and Daniel Choi star as two teachers who will hopefully be able to turn a class of delinquents around. But what do you get when you pack the entire spectrum of high school into one small room? More drama than four years can handle!
