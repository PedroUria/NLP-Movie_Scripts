A Sun Ma Si-tsang comedy with the usual masquerades and hijinks from the master. The film contains locations of the Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park in the 50's (now defunct), precious footage that shows film's role as a preserver of Hong Kong's history. Lee plays a young pubescent kid developing his first taste for the opposite sex, disguising himself as an adult to watch a striptease show and even demonstrating how to become an "Ah Fei" lady killer. Burs is also seen in sailor's outfit and in glasses speaking with a stammer, recalling a similar turn in Fist of Fury more than ten years later.::Hong Kong Film Archive
