Directed by The Greatest Showman's own Michael Gracey, and Beth McCarthy-Miller, "Come Alive" featured 150 dancers in period costume with fun, circussy enhancements, like bright pink wigs and gowns in vibrant shades of violet or blue-green, breaking from the practical shades of the 19th century. The "freak show" element upon which Barnum made his living is glammed up and romanticized, transformed into a technicolor homily that feels more about celebrating inclusion, particularly for the people who populated his band--bearded ladies, tattooed men, conjoined twins and little people.
