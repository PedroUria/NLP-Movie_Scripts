Mississippi Snake Grabbers is a lifestyle-reality episodic series featuring 6 Mississippi law enforcement agents (DEA, Bureau of Narcotics, State Troopers, District Attorney, etc) who, on the weekends head out to the wilds of Mississippi and catch snakes with their bare hands. The idea of the series is that the 6 guides take out a group of 'civilians' and teach them how to hand-grab snakes!::Anonymous
