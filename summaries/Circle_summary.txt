An exquisite Crop Circle movie with a HUGE discovery that should not be overlooked. The film maker found a visible line of communication between 2 Balls of Light just before they laid a Crop Circle down! Is Anybody Listening? See it for yourself. Incredible interviews and cinematography will leave many convinced that there is something ET going on in our crop fields today. Sacred geometric wonder in nature from 2007, 2008 and 2009. It won 2 EBE Awards at the International UFO Congress Convention. '2010 Best Feature Film-UFO or Related' and '2010 Best Musical Score Within A UFO Program.' Proof, Passion and Truth that may shake the world and awaken lost DNA in many. This is a Wake Up Call to listen!::Anonymous
