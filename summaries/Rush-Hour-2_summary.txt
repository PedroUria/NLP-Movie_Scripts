A divided into three different segments: "Chicken Chop" (5:01), "The Bomb" (9:20), and "Slide For Life" (5:47). These were some of the best aspects of the DVD, as they provided closer looks at the creation of these scenes. While a fair amount of narration discussed the snippets, the behind the scenes shots were the focus, and they provided excellent material. We saw the location scout for "Chicken", storyboards for "Slide", outtakes and working through the content for "Bomb" as well as a lot of other interesting shots.
