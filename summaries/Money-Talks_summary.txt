Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert review five new movies. There's a major disagreement on Leave It to Beaver (1997), the movie adaptation of the old sitcom. Ebert gives it a marginal thumbs up for its charm, but Siskel finds it utterly charmless. They have a slighter disagreement over Money Talks (1997). Both agree on what's good about the movie (Chris Tucker) and what's bad (Charlie Sheen and the crash-'em-up third act), but the good part was good enough for Ebert to recommend it; Siskel gives it thumbs down. Two thumbs up for Mimic (1997), Guillermo del Toro's exciting creature feature about horrific bugs in the New York subway system. Two thumbs down for Masterminds (1997), a "vacuous" family action picture that the critics could barely remember even a few days after they saw it. Two thumbs up for the lovely Iranian fantasy film, Gabbeh (1996). Finally, Siskel's "Video Pick of the Week" is the hilarious mock-doc, Waiting for Guffman (1996).::J. Spurlin
