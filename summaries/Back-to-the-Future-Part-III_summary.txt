Marty McFly, Emmett Brown, and Jennifer Parker go to 2015 to improve the future. While there, two tasks need to be accomplished, including surviving a hoverboard chase, and escorting Jennifer out of the McFly residence without being seen by any of the McFly family. Then they head back to 1985, and discover that it's been changed for the worse by the elderly Biff Tannen, who stole the DeLorean time machine in 2015. Now Marty must fight his way through a dystopian Hill Valley, and confront Biff Tannen to discover when his older self gave him the Grays Sports Almanac to make himself rich and corrupt Hill Valley in the process. Marty and Doc head back to 1955, where Marty must complete a puzzle while his younger self is playing on stage at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, before time runs out, to ensure that Biff's gang doesn't prevent Marty's original return to 1985. Finally, Marty has to survive a final hoverboard chase against Biff Tannen, in order to take back the almanac and restore 1985 to its former condition.::GusF
