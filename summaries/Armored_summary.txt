Deep in the heart of San Antonio, Texas Armoring Corporation (TAC) turns everyday cars into bulletproofed, bomb-resistant, gadget-filled fortresses, equipped with cutting-edge getaway gizmos and futuristic protective devices that rival those of any 007 James Bond film. Brand new cars direct from the dealer are torn apart piece-by-piece and then rebuilt-stronger, safer, smarter, and sexier. Led by charismatic Trent Kimball and his savvy brother-in-law, Jason Forston, TAC is aided and abetted by a motley crew of expert engineers. When not at the factory, Trent is the father of six rowdy children and married to his live-wire of a wife, Courtney. Jason and his lovable wife, Lacy, are first-time parents to a rambunctious one-year-old. Trent and Jason devote their time to work, family and their LDS faith . . . and along the way they get to shoot guns and blow things up all in the name of "business."::Texas Armoring Corp.
