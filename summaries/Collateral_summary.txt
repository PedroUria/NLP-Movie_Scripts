This documentary chronicles the making of the film Collateral (2004). We get to see Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx training for their roles, as well as Jada Pinket Smith's Audition. Michael Mann also informs us on his preparation for the film, as well as some more behind-the-scenes looks at the 17 special camera-ready taxis and the taxi crash.::Rhyl Donnelly
