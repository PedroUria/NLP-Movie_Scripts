A making-of piece that features an overview of the film and the history of the real-life story behind it, the quality of the cast, shooting segments in Russia, transforming a decayed Russian period-appropriate sub into the K-19, shooting in the cramped quarters of the sub, cast preparation for the roles, the work of Kathryn Bigelow, the challenges of shooting some of the scenes, and more. The piece is constructed through clips from the film, interview snippets with cast and crew, and behind-the-scenes footage.
