The amazing true story of one white Southern woman's courage to choose her convictions and join the Civil Rights Movement. By the time she was 19, Joan Trumpauer was shot at, attacked, and put on death row but that's just the beginning of her remarkable journey to help change the world. Heralded as an unsung hero but disowned by her family, Joan takes us on an incredible journey of her life in the Civil Rights Movement and the power of the human spirit to persevere against the world. Shot over the course of a year in six states, 'An Ordinary Hero' is the only complete story of Joan Trumpauer and includes interviews with scholars, authors, journalists and those who fought along side this courageous woman.::Anonymous
