In Jordan, in the heart of the Middle East, Iraqi, Palestinian and Lebanese refugees are working on the filming of Incendies, an adaptation of Wajdi Mouawad's play. Whether extras or onlookers, these exiles once experienced scenes very similar to the ones depicted in Denis Villeneuve's movie. Se souvenir des cendres explores their views on the vicious war and cycle of violence being recreated before their eyes, and by their own efforts.::Barbeau-Lavalette, Anaïs
