This spectacular 94-minute concert was recorded live with the Melbourne Philharmonic Orchestra in 1975, at the Sydney Myer Concert Bowl in Melbourne Australia to a 30,000 audience. This mammoth sell-out concert to tens of thousands was at the end of the 'Journey Tour' to promote the album "Journey to the Centre of the Earth", which sold over 12,000,000 copies worldwide. The concert opens with the greatest hits from Rick's biggest selling album The Six Wives of Henry VIII, followed by the complete 'Journey' and also includes hits from his then-new album King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. This is classic Rick Wakeman, one of the world's finest keyboard players, at the very pinnacle of his legendary progressive rock career.
