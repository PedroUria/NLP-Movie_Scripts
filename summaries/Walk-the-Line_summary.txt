Walking the Line offers a harrowing view of the chaos along the U.S.-Mexico border through private citizens who are taking the law into their own hands. Following a growing movement of anti-immigrant vigilantes, some clad in fatigues and armed with semi-automatic weapons, the documentary provides a scathing critique of our failed border policy.::Jeremy Levine and Landon Van Soest
