Uncomfortable with the adolescent exploits of his "friends," he finds escape through a passionate love of maps. Unexpected friendships with classmate Alison, whose sweetness and innocence belie a dark secret, and Mary, a blind young woman on the cusp of adulthood, rouse Michael from his isolation and send him on a journey of self-discovery.
