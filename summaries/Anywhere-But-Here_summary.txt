Sabrina is tired of the restrictions that come with being a kid. She casts a spell that catapults her into adulthood. She loves the freedom at first but then shirks at the responsibility that comes with being an adult. Sabrina must reverse the spell before she is stuck in adulthood and misses out on being a kid.::Anonymous
