Lambert is an addict. A sex addict. It once cost him his pilot job, but he's now trying to work it out through a support group and a new career as couples therapist. Judith has no problem. She's a nymphomaniac who's delighted to sleep with everyone she likes and particularly the men she works with. Until it gets her fired. So now she's crashing at her grumpy old uncle's home, until she gets back on her feet. When Judith applies for a job at Lambert's practice, they are instantly attracted to each other. But the more she tries to seduce him, the more he wants to build a healthy relationship with her... one not based on sex. It's an uphill battle every day, to keep her from jumping his bones!::lament
