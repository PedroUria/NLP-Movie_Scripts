Ancient codes hidden within the Torah reveal the secrets of global events, past (i.e., Hitler, the Kennedy assassination, the Gulf War), present, and future. One man (York) is after the Code, seeking the power to change the world as we know it... for the worse. Another (Van Dien) seeks the truth, risking his life and everything he stands for in order to stop him.::Anonymous
