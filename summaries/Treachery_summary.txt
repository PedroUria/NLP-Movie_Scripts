This rendition of an old-school silent comedy is about a young man, in his twenties, who is submerged within a surreal and bizarre faux civilization that is subjugated by stuffed animals. Living in what seems to be a happy, normal life, things take a turn for the worst when finds out that he has been nothing but a lab rat within a social experiment conducted by behavioural scientists.
