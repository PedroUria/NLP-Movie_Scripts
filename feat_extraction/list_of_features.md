# List of Features

The features that are "per character" will need some kind of aggregation, or maybe even better, PCA, as Sean suggested.

Feel free to list any features. Put a feature under Potential if you are not sure about whether to extract it or not, and under Will Do if you would like to extract it (either yourself or someone else) but are not working on it right now.

## Completed

1. Number of unique words per character (needs agg)
2. [Flesch–Kincaid readability level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch–Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch_reading_ease) per character (needs agg)
3. Number of stop words per character (needs agg)
4. Number of curse words per character (needs agg)
5. Number of times a character says any other character's name (needs agg)

## In Progress

1. Character Sentiment Detection


## Will Do



## Potential

1. Character Emotions Detection... seems pretty tough for what I have seen online.
2. Character Sentiment Detection (does this even make sense, or will it work with models trained on reviews data?).
