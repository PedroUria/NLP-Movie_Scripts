# List of Features

The features that are "per character" will need some kind of aggregation, or maybe even better, PCA, as Sean suggested.

Feel free to list any features. Put a feature under Potential if you are not sure about whether to extract it or not, and under Will Do if you would like to extract it (either yourself or someone else) but are not working on it right now.

## Completed

1. Number of standard deviations the number of unique words for the top five characters is above/below the mean of all the number of unique words for the top five characters across all movies.
2. Mean [Flesch–Kincaid readability level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch–Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch_reading_ease) of top 5 characters.
3. Number of standard deviations the number of stop words for the top five characters is above/below the mean of all the number of stop words for the top five characters across all movies.
4. Same as 3. and 1. for curse words.
5. Same as 4., 3. and 1.
6. How relevant is the main character, i.e, length of main's character dialogue with respect to the top 5 characters

## In Progress

1. Something (Your Name)


## Will Do



## Potential

1. Character Emotions Detection... seems pretty tough for what I have seen online.
2. Character Sentiment Detection (does this even make sense, or will it work with models trained on reviews data?).
