     A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
     scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

     An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin -
     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.

                             MORELL
               What kind is it?

                               VANGER O/S
               I don't know.    White.

                             MORELL
               And the frame?

                               VANGER O/S
               Dark.

                             VANGER O/S
               Same as last time.

                               MORELL
               No note.

                               VANGER O/S
               No.

3    INT. VANGER'S STUDY - SAME TIME                                 3

     Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
                             VANGER
               I can't take it anymore.
                             MORELL O/S
               I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -
                                                             2.

     Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -

                             BLOMKVIST
               What is this, the media event of the
               year?
                             REPORTER 1
               Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
               won't work.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Don't try to play it up, that won't
               either.

     Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -

                             REPORTER 2
               Will you appeal?
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a
               real story to cover.
     He hurries off in the rain.

                             NEWSCASTER V/O
               Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
               was found guilty today on 16 counts
               of aggravated libel against financier
               Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

5    INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                                   5

     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.
                                                            3.
                                                             3.
    

                            TV NEWSCASTER
              In an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -

                            WENNERSTROM ON TV
              I have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
                            BLOMKVIST
              Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.

    He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.

                            TV NEWSCASTER V/O
              Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

    He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
    young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
    walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the
    editor's office.
                                                          4.

                        ERIKA
          Where you been?

Erika Berger is about Blomkvist's age, and - like the
IKEA furniture - sends a mixed message: a feminist in a
mini-skirt.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Walking.    Thinking.

                          ERIKA
          Smoking?

                          BLOMKVIST
          Just one.
He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair.
                        ERIKA
          TV4 called. I told them no
          statement until we've read the
          judgment in its entirety.

                          BLOMKVIST
          I have.    Who else?
                        ERIKA
          Everyone who's ever wanted to see
          you humiliated.
                        BLOMKVIST
          You've been on the phone all day
          then.

                        ERIKA
          I'm as much to blame for this as you.

                          BLOMKVIST
          You are?    You wrote it?
                          ERIKA
          I read it.    I ran it.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Not the same.
                        ERIKA
          Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Mine is.
They regard each other in another silence.      Then -
                                                             5.
                                                              5.
     

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm tired. I feel like climbing
               under a duvet and sleeping for a
               week.
                             ERIKA
               Alone?
     He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'

                             ERIKA
               I already called Greger and told him
               I wouldn't be home tonight.

10   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - MILTON SECURITY - DAY            10

     Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a
     New Jersey crime family than CEO of a high-tech security
     firm, sits behind his desk, waiting with an older client.

                             ARMANSKY
               It's possible we could wait forever.
                             FRODE
               You called her, I thought.     You spoke
               to her.
                             ARMANSKY
               I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

                             FRODE
               I don't understand.

                             ARMANSKY
               No one here likes her. So it's
               better if she works at home.
                             FRODE
               But you told her I wanted to meet
               her.

                             ARMANSKY
               But I've told her many more times I
               prefer her not to meet clients.

     The figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby. From
     behind we can't see him/her well, but can see wary looks
     from others emerging from and getting into the elevator.

                             FRODE V/O
               But you like her.
                             ARMANSKY V/O
               Very much. She's one of the best
               investigators I have. As you saw
               from her report -

12   INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - SAME TIME - CONTINUED              12

     The report on Armansky's desk is 200 pages long.

     INSERT: Printed on its cover: Mikael Blomkvist, a case
     number and, smaller, its author, Lisbeth Salander.
                               FRODE
               But.

                             ARMANSKY
               I'm concerned you won't like her.
               She's different.
                               FRODE
               In what way.

                               ARMANSKY
               In every way.

                             SECRETARY/INTERCOM
               Ms. Salander's here.

     Armansky breathes a defeated sigh, taps the intercom
     button twice to say `okay, let her in.'

     Lisbeth Salander walks in: A small, pale, anorexic-
     looking waif in her early 20's. Short black-dyed hair -
     pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
     several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
     shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.

     Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
     initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
     is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.

                             ARMANSKY
               Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
                             FRODE
               How do you do?
                                                           7.
                                                            7.
   

She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:

                        SALANDER
          Something wrong with the report?
                        FRODE
          No. It seems quite thorough.
          There's a wealth of data here. But
          I'm also interested to know what's
          not in it.

                        SALANDER
          There's nothing not in it.

                        FRODE
          Your opinion of him isn't.

                        SALANDER
          I'm not paid to give my opinion.

                        FRODE
          So you don't have one?

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -
                         SALANDER
          He's clean.   In my opinion.

                        FRODE
          He's - excuse me?

                        SALANDER
          He's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.

                        FRODE
          There's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.
                        SALANDER
          That's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?

                        SALANDER
          If he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.

                        FRODE
          Are you saying he was set up?
                                                        8.
                                                         8.


                        SALANDER
          That wasn't part of my assignment.

And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
                        FRODE
          You're quite right he made a fool of
          himself professionally. How big of a
          fool did he make of himself
          financially?

                        SALANDER
          The judgement will just about empty
          his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
has been said, and Salander sees it.
                        SALANDER
          May I go?

                        FRODE
          Your report is light in another
          area. His personal life. Anything
          you chose not to include?
                        SALANDER
          Nothing that warranted inclusion.

                        FRODE
          I'm not sure if that means yes or no.

                        ARMANSKY
          I think what Ms. Salander means, and
          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.

                        FRODE
          Not in this case. I have to know
          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
                        SALANDER
          He's had a long sexual relationship
          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.
                                                              9.
                                                               9.
      

                              FRODE
                You were right not to include that.

                              SALANDER
                I know.
                              FRODE
                Anything else?
                              SALANDER
                No.

                              FRODE
                Please think before you say no.
                              SALANDER
                I did.
                              FRODE
                I don't want to be surprised by
                something later.

      Salander offers nothing more.

                             FRODE
                So. Nothing else. In the personal
                department. You're sure.

                              SALANDER
                     (pause)
                He likes sandwiches.

15    INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                        15
      Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed
      snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika -
      in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather
      jacket.

      She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened
      living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half-
      eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.

                              ERIKA
                Usually when I wake up in a cold
                bed, it's at home.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Sorry.

                              ERIKA
                What are you doing?
                                                              10.
                                                              10.
      

                               BLOMKVIST
                 Writing the press release.

                               ERIKA
                 Saying -
                               BLOMKVIST
                 You're taking over as publisher.
                 You're sorry for any nuisance
                 Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be
                 reached for comment.

                               ERIKA
                 You're giving up.
                               BLOMKVIST
                 Just taking a few steps aside.
                 For you.
                               ERIKA
                 This makes me sick.

      Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with
      a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas
      bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60
      Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price
      tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her
      cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.

      She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
      softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
      It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.

      She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
      belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
      Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
      table and, next to it, a body.
      The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
      by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
      it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.
      Calls for an ambulance.

19    INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - EVENING          19

      It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering
      going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with
      eggnog are:
                                                          11.
                                                          11.
  

Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister
Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly
understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around
her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).
                        GREGER
          You needed a better attorney.       You
          needed your sister.
                          BLOMKVIST
          She offered.

                          ANNIKA
          He declined.
                          BLOMKVIST
          As she hoped.
                        ANNIKA
          Never a good idea mixing family and
          business.

                        BLOMKVIST
          And I still would have lost.

                        GREGOR
          Did you have ... anything on him.

                          BLOMKVIST
          I had a lot.    It just wasn't any
          good.

                        ERIKA
          It wasn't even about Mikael. It
          was Wennerstrom sending a message to
          the press as a whole - and the FSA:
          Don't ask questions.

Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to
          worry about me.

                        PERNILLA
          Mom's worried.
                          BLOMKVIST
          About me?

                        PERNILLA
          About all that money.
                                                               12.
                                                               12.
       

20   INT. SODER HOSPITAL - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                     20

     Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog
     who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For
     the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
     The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets
     up to hear his report -

                              DOCTOR
                You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
                               SALANDER
                His ward.   He doesn't have a
                daughter.

     The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her.
                               SALANDER
                Please.
21   INT. ICU - SODER HOSPITAL - LATER - NIGHT                   21
     Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at
     Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending
     him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from
     his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.

                              DOCTOR V/O
                He's had severe cerebral
                hemorrhaging. Either from the
                fall itself, or a stroke that led to
                the fall. His blood pressure is
                still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain
                consciousness, but that's not
                assured. And it's possible, if he
                does, there will be neurological
                damage.

     They're around the dinner table now, passing platters
     around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed
     in silent prayer.

                                BLOMKVIST
                Nilla?    What are you doing?
                               PERNILLA
                Nothing.

                              BLOMKVIST
                     (pause)
                You're not serious.

                        PERNILLA
          I don't want to talk about it since
          I know you won't approve.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Of -
               (she doesn't say)
          Nilla.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Light of - what?
               (she doesn't repeat it)
          What is that?

                        PERNILLA
          You think it's all senseless but it
          isn't. It's more natural to believe
          in something than not to.

She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a
little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as
you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
It's Blomkvist's.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Excuse me.
Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps
away to take the call.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Hello.
                        FRODE O/S
          Mr. Blomkvist?

                        BLOMKVIST
          Yes.

                        FRODE O/S
          Forgive me for intruding on your
          Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode.
          I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
          Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of
          (him) -

                        BLOMKVIST
          Of course.
                        FRODE O/S
          He'd like to speak to you about a
          private matter.
                                                               14.

                              BLOMKVIST
                You know, you're calling at an
                awkward time.

                              FRODE O/S
                I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to
                Christmas dinner myself.
                              BLOMKVIST
                That's not what I mean.

                              FRODE O/S
                You're referring to your recent
                legal trouble. That has provided Mr.
                Vanger with some entertainment.
                               BLOMKVIST
                Excuse me?

                              FRODE O/S
                He doesn't care for Wennerstrom
                either.

      Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling
      Blomkvist in like a perch.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Have him call me.
                              FRODE O/S
                He'd like to meet in person if that's
                okay. Up north. Hedestad.

                               BLOMKVIST
                No.   Sorry.

                              FRODE O/S
                He's much too old to make a trip to
                Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please.
                If you'd be so kind as to consider.

      Blomkvist isn't sure what to do, or say.
                              FRODE O/S
                Hedestad is lovely in winter.      Like a

      Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels
      even more cut off from the people around her than usual;
      completely alone.

      makes its way north. This is no Christmas card.

      Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only
      assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him
      from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed
      for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.

                              FRODE
                First time in Hedestad?

                You said it was lovely in winter.

                              FRODE
                This is unseasonable.

                              BLOMKVIST
                I'll be on the 4:30 train back to
                Stockholm.

                              FRODE
                Unless we get snowed in ... I'm
                joking. You'll be home tonight, if
                that's what you wish.

27    INT/EXT. MERCEDES - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                   27
      The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading
      to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
      who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
      attention; just someone hunting.

                               VANGER
                Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm.
                                                               16.
                                                               16.

     It is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces.
     And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly
     as they come through the house -
                             VANGER
               Thank you for coming way out here.
               Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's
               insufficient coat. Would you like to
               freshen up? We'll be having dinner
               later. For now, hot tea is waiting.
               Unless you'd like a drink instead.
               What would you like?

                             FRODE
               Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the
               4:30 train back to Stockholm.

                               VANGER
               What?

                             BLOMKVIST
               I can't stay for dinner.

     Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt.

                            VANGER
               Oh. I guess I'd better be quick
               then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael,
               this way.
29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29

     Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate
     Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger
     of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair.

                             VANGER
               What do you know about me?
                             BLOMKVIST
               That you used to run one of the
               biggest industrial firms in the
               country.

                              VANGER
               Used to.   That's correct.

     There are framed black and white photographs on a wall -
     factories and trains figuring into all of them.
                                                              17.
                                                              17.
      

                               VANGER
                 My grandfather forged the tracks
                 the 4:30 train will take you home on -
                 and most of the other pre-state-owned
                 rail lines.   We stitched this
                 country together. We made the steel
                 and milled the lumber that built
                 modern Sweden.
                      (pause)
                 You know what our most profitable
                 product now is?
                      (Blomkvist doesn't)
                 Fertilizer.

      Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug.
                               VANGER
                 I'm not obsessed with the declining
                 health of the company, but I am with
                 the settling of accounts - and the
                 clock is ticking. I need your help.

                               BLOMKVIST
                 Doing.

                               VANGER
                 Officially, assisting me with my
                 memoirs. But what you'd really be
                 doing is solving a mystery. And
                 you'd do that by doing what you do so
                 well - this recent legal mishap of
                 yours notwithstanding. You'd be
                 investigating thieves, misers,
                 bullies, and malcontents - the most
                 detestable collection of people
                 you'll ever meet ... my family.

      She exhumes an unwashed bowl from a sinkful of dirty
      dishes, fills it with tap water without rinsing it, dumps
      a packet of ramen noodles in, puts it in a microwave.

      She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge
      to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full
      ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork,
      unwashed laundry.

     Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo.

     His official company photo accompanies his profile:

     She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
     Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him
     alongside his bio. She skims it -

     personal wealth of 12 billion dollars (80 billion kronor)
     ... 82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ...

     She does a third search, types:
     Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached'
     option -

     There are only a couple of results that include both
     terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some
     old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and

     The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and
     incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing
     a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -

                             VANGER V/O
               This is Harriet. The granddaughter
               of my brother Richard.

32   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                 32
     The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger
     shows Blomkvist.
                             VANGER
               Richard, who I may as well start
               with to get it out of the way, was a
               Nazi of the first order - joining the
               Nationalist Socialist Freedom League
               when he was 17.
                                                         19.
                                                         19.
 

A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young
man in a uniform with a Nazi pin.

                         VANGER
           Isn't it interesting how fascists
           always steal the word freedom.
                (Blomkvist checks his watch)
           The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway,
           Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
           cause in 1940 - missed all the real
           excitement - but not the opportunity
           to regularly beat his wife Margareta
           and their son, Gottfried.

We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.

                         VANGER
           Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father -
           was what people used to call a Good-
           Time-Charlie.

                         BLOMKVIST
           They're still called that.
                          VANGER
           Are they?   Okay.
INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried.

                         VANGER
           He was a charmer, a ladies man, a
           drunk. In other words, a born
           salesman - which is what he did for
           the company - traveling around,
           taking clients out to dinner and so
           on.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Someone has to do it.
                        VANGER
           That's right. Anyway, he died in
           1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
           island.
A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.

                         VANGER
           His wife Isabella - who was pretty
           much useless before as a parent -
           became even more so after his death -
           which is when I began looking after
           their children - Martin - who runs
           Vanger Industries now that I'm
           retired - and Harriet.
                                                             20.
                                                             20.
     

     A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet.

                              VANGER
                She was bright and curious, a
                winning combination in any person.
                              BLOMKVIST
                And beautiful.
     Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...

                              BLOMKVIST
                Something happened to her?

     Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ...
                              VANGER
                Someone in the family murdered
                Harriet and for the last forty years
                has been trying to drive me insane.

                It was September 21st, 1966.    A
                Saturday. Harriet was 16.

36   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY - 1966                           36

     Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.

                              VANGER V/O
                My brothers - along with their
                wives, children and grandchildren -
                had gathered here for our loathsome
                annual board meeting and dinner. It
                was also the day the Yacht Club held
                its Autumn parade.

37   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966                                37

     And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining
     the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
                                                             21.
                                                             21.
     

                             VANGER V/O
               Harriet and a couple of school
               friends had gone into town to watch
               it. She returned a little after two
               o'clock.
38   INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966                         38

     A clock in the room reads, 2:10.    Vanger and a few family
     members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears.

                             VANGER V/O
               She came to the parlor. She asked
               if she could talk to me. I honestly
               don't remember what I was doing that
               I thought was more important, but I
               told her to give me a few minutes.
     She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room.

                             VANGER V/O
               But in a few minutes, before I could
               go upstairs to talk to her, something
               else occurred.

39   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966                           39
     A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on
     the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the
     car and spewing gasoline.
                             VANGER V/O
               The accident had nothing to do with
               Harriet - and everything.

40   INT. VANGER'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY - 1966                    40

     Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash.
     Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of
     those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.

                             VANGER V/O
               It was chaos as everyone dropped what
               they were doing.

41   EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966                              41
     People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.

                             VANGER V/O
               Police, an ambulance, fire brigade,
               reporter, photographer and onlookers
               quickly arrived from town, as those
               of us on the island - the family -
               hurried to the bridge from our side.
                                                              22.
                                                              22.
      

      The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but
      the other motorist is trapped.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The driver of the car - a Mr.
                 Aronsson - was pinned and severely
                 injured. All we could do was try to
                 pry him out with our hands - since
                 metal tools could spark.

      A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap
      pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry
      the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues -

                               VANGER V/O
                 About twenty minutes after the crash,
                 Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna
                 herself saw her.
42    INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                  42

      Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out
      the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that
      reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ...

43    EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966                             43
      As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make
      progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man
      coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
                               VANGER V/O
                 We finally got poor Aronsson out of
                 his car and off to the hospital, and
                 those of us on our side drifted back
                 to the house.

44    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                          44

      The family has assembled at a long dining table.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The sun was down, the excitement
                 over, we sat down to dinner. That's
                 when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.

      Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
      including the young man from the bridge, his jacket
      draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.

                               VANGER V/O
                 And she wasn't there the next
                 morning. Or the next. Or the next
                 forty years.

45    INT. VANGER'S MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                 45

      Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he
      leads Blomkvist up some stairs.

                              VANGER
                What was she going to tell me? Why
                didn't I make time for her? Why
                didn't I listen?

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have run away?

                              VANGER
                Not without being seen.

45A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT - 1966                           45A
      The crews continue their work under lights.

                              VANGER
                Firemen stayed on the bridge all
                night pumping out the gasoline. And
                no one swam across, or took a row
                boat. All of them were still tied up
                on this side Sunday. Believe me, we
                checked.
45B   INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                   45B

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have fallen and drowned?

                              VANGER
                The currents aren't strong here.
                Anything that falls into the water
                turns up nearby. Like her father.
                His body didn't drift more than ten
                meters when he drowned the year
                before.
      Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his
      labored breathing.

                              VANGER
                No. Someone killed her, Mr.
                Blomkvist. Someone on the island
                that day. Someone close enough to
                know what she used to give me each
                year on my birthday.
      He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to
      reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a
      wall.
                                                             24.
                                                             24.
     

                             VANGER
               These were from her.

     And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers -
                             VANGER
               These, from her killer.
     Blomkvist regards the forty ...

                             BLOMKVIST
               Who knows about these?

                             VANGER
               Me, the police, the murderer ...
               and now you.




46   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK                                     46
     It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
     a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from
     the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number
     tones the woman keys in the code lock.

     The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
     Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones
     in the Milton Security lock.
47   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - CONTINUOUS          47

     Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage
     whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to
     an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement
     machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters,
     Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera.
     She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front
     door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes
     it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass.

     The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the
     door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an
     idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom.

48   EXT. VANGER'S MANOR - NIGHT                               48

     The rain here is icier and more punishing.

                             VANGER V/O
               When the police investigation petered
               out, I kept at it -
                                                            25.
                                                            25.
    

49   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                                49

     They're eating dinner now in the dining room.

                             VANGER
               - studying their reports and
               interviews, all the information there
               was, and it's a lot. I've spent half
               my life examining the events of a
               single day.
     And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I understand your frustration.
               But what you're asking me to do is
               a waste of money.
                             VANGER
               We haven't discussed your fee.
                             BLOMKVIST
               We don't need to. I can't find
               something you haven't been able to
               in forty years.

                             VANGER
               You don't know that. You have a
               very keen investigative mind.

     Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as
     Vanger refills his wine glass.
                             VANGER
               Here's what I propose: You come
               stay on the island. I have a nice
               little cottage by the water you can
               use. You study the material I give
               you. You find something I've missed
               - or you don't.

                             BLOMKVIST
               You want me to set aside my life
               and career for something that's a
               complete waste of time.

                             VANGER
               Think of it as a well deserved
               vacation. A way of avoiding all the
               people you want to avoid right now.
                    (nothing from Blomkvist)
               As for compensation, I'll pay you
               twice your salary for as many months
               as it takes. I'll quadruple it if
               you solve the mystery.
                                                             26.
                                                             26.
     

                              BLOMKVIST
                Mr. (Vanger) -

                              VANGER
                I'm not done. I'll throw in one
                more thing - even though you're a
                terrible negotiator. It's what you
                want more than anything else and it
                can't be bought at any price. I'll
                give it to you ... Hans-Erik
                Wennerstrom.

      He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the
      fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and
      the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a
      moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
                              VANGER
                He began his career working for me.
                And I've followed it with interest,
                shall we say, ever since. You were
                right about him. You just couldn't
                prove it.

A50   EXT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                  A50

50    INT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                 50

      Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that
      couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks
      on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.

      It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing
      over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back
      into the shadows of his dark apartment.

                              PLAGUE
                Would you like to sit? I could
                possibly clear a place if necessary.

      It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish
      that. The place is like a junkyard. Even the unmade bed
      is covered with stuff.
                              SALANDER
                Did you make it?
                              PLAGUE
                Have you something for me?

      She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him.    He
      counts it and is unimpressed with its total.

                              PLAGUE
                I'm on welfare; I don't administer
                it. This isn't enough.
                                                              27.
                                                              27.
     

                              SALANDER
                I had to pay three months back rent
                and eat a little bit. It's all I
                have right now.
                              PLAGUE
                I find that so poignant.
      So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
      She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and
      moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end
      computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives
      her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
      in her hands.

      While it's clear both these people are deficient in
      behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell
      which lacks it more.

                              PLAGUE
                No `thank you?'
51    INT. MILLENNIUM OFFICE - EARLY MORNING                    51

      Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks,
      comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to-
      go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies
      from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase,
      presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
                              ERIKA V/O
                You can't be serious -

51A   INT/EXT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - EARLY MORNING - LATER    51A
      He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and
      gathers the rest.

                              ERIKA
                We're in our worst crisis ever and
                you're writing a memoir?
                              BLOMKVIST
                You fired me; I need something to do.
                              ERIKA
                You fired you; I need you here, not
                the North Pole. You know what this
                is going to look like.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Like I've been gutted. Like I'm
                running away. I am.
      They cross through the building, he with his cases, she
      with her coffee cup.
                                                            28.
                                                            28.
    

                             BLOMKVIST
               Wennerstrom wants to see me waving
               a white flag, not a red one. And the
               more it looks like there's a problem
               between you and me, the more it'll
               satisfy him.

                             ERIKA
               There is a problem between us. He
               won't be satisfied until he shuts us
               down, and you're leaving me to fight
               him alone.

     He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a
     statue - and steps outside.
                             BLOMKVIST
               It's four hours by train.   It's not
               the North Pole.
52   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                      52
     The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with
     two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
     He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi
     stand.
53   INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY                                 53

     As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist
     regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him
     in the rear view mirror.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Think this snow's going to let up
               anytime soon?

                             HUSSEIN
               This is the North Pole.

54   EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                       54

     The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
     he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
     taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
55   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                       55
     Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would
     call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.

     Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out
     books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and
     a small printer.
                                                               29.
                                                               29.
       

     He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
     reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
     it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
     a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
     straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.
                                BLOMKVIST
               What.   Milk?

     He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing.
56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56

     He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone
     out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
     Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't.
57   INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK                               57

     He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some
     packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food.
58   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        58

     He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow,
     cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
     Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
     - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.

59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59

     Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
     can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
     end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.

                             BLOMKVIST
               It's me. I'm here. It's fucking
               cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
               tried to call, the reception sucks,
               and if you tried to email, there's
               none of that either, so - so - I'm
               here - and - I can't even speak it's
               so fucking cold.

     He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
     before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
     the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.

60   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                        60

     As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to
     get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a
     struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout.
                                                             30.
                                                             30.
     

61   EXT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       61

     Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones.
62   INT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       62
     In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from
     the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box.
63   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                                      63

     The bell in the church tower clangs -

64   INT. COTTAGE - DAWN                                       64

     But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having
     forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
     him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
     the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

                              NILSSON
               I'm Gunner.   The caretaker.
65   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN                               65

     As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for
     him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents,
     fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums.

                             NILSSON
               You're an author.
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm writing a biography of Mr.
               Vanger, yes.

     Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. Maybe he
     took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.
                             NILSSON
               I saw you on television.
                             BLOMKVIST
               That's unfortunate.

                             NILSSON
               Bit of trouble, I guess.

     Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to
     the subject. It isn't.

                             NILSSON
               No jail time, though. That's good.
               Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
                                                             31.
                                                             31.
    

     Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson
     dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.

                                NILSSON
               There.
66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66

     Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.

                             VANGER
               The island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can
               believe. Two in the family. He's
               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.

                             BLOMKVIST
               He was there that day?

                             VANGER
               Indeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
     suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
                             VANGER
               That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
               They don't speak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Does anyone speak to anyone on this
               island?

                             VANGER
               Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother
               - who lives there -
                    (points)
               - she speaks to Harald - which is one
               of reasons I don't speak to her.
                    (points)
               Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Who doesn't he speak to?
                             VANGER
               You, probably. Not that you'd want
               him to. He can be as unpleasant as
               Harald.
                                                        32.
                                                        32.


                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm quickly losing track who's who.

                        VANGER
          Oh, how you'll wish were it always
          so. Soon you'll know us all only too
          well - with my apologies.
               (points)
          Out there is my nephew Martin's
          house; Harriet's brother.

It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Who speaks to him?
                        VANGER
          I speak to him. He runs the company
          now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

                        VANGER
          Someone shooting their dinner.
          Gunner probably. The caretaker.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I just met him.
                        VANGER
          He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
                        VANGER
          He lives over there.

Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
                        BLOMKVIST
          And you live here.

                        VANGER
          Sorry?
                        BLOMKVIST
          Your house.

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.
                                                                    33.
                                                                    33.
     

                              VANGER
                Yes, you're right. The man who
                hires the detective should always be
                kept on the suspects list.
66A   OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                      66A


67    INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 67

      A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with
      Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing
      a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.

                              SALANDER
                I got a call from social welfare.
                I've been assigned a new guardian.

      It's unlikely he understands what she has said.        It's
      unlikely he even knows she's there.

68    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            68
      Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist
      has written the names of the living Vanger family members
      and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
      Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree -
      which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards
      is the word, `deceased.'
      He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
      reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy
      of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer
      Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."

69    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                               69

      Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly
      motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to
      pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.

      INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby
      Island, 11:42 p.m."

70    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                                70
      Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie
      locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan
      sitting in the living room looking suitably worried.

                              MORELL
                I'd like to see the girl's room.

                              VANGER
                It's down the hall.
                                                              34.
                                                              34.
      

                             MORELL
               I thought this was your house.

                               VANGER
               It is.    She lives with me.
                             MORELL
               Are her parents alive?
                             VANGER
               Her mother is.

     Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and
     smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a
     woman as venomous as she is beautiful.
                              VANGER
               This way.
     Morell follows Vanger down a hall -

     INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx. 12:05, inspected
     missing girl's bedroom. Found - "
71   INT. HARRIET'S ROOM - VANGER MANOR - DAWN - 1966           71

     A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully
     removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief,
     wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address
     book. He leafs through this.
                             DET. MORELL
               I want to speak to everyone here.
               That'll take all night so you might
               want someone to put some coffee on.

                             YOUNGER VANGER
               What about the search?

                             MORELL
               First thing in the morning.
                             YOUNGER VANGER
               No. We should do it now. She could
               be hurt out there.

     Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide.
                              VANGER
               Please.   I beg you.
     INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat
     and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell."
                                                              35.

      The police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around
      the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs.
71B   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                         71B

      The weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their
      interviews with Morell. At the moment, he's across the
      room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee.

      INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Patrol 014 and Orienteering
      Club volunteers assembled, 6:40 a.m."

      Search parties crisscross the island, wade through
      ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys.
      Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods.

                               MORELL V/O
                 We searched for days ...

75    EXT/INT. TRAIN - MOVING - LAKE SILJAN - PRESENT DAY       75

      A train bisects the landscape.   Blomkvist looks out.
                               MORELL V/O
                 Eventually, much to his dismay - and
                 mine - I had to talk to Henrik about
                 calling it off -

      As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't
      slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the
      water. Somehow he knows they're never going to find her.

                               MORELL V/O
                 The fact that I never found a body
                 didn't surprise me. You can't dig
                 up an entire island.

      The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to
      Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks
      with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.
                                                         36.
                                                         36.
 

                          MORELL
          But   I also couldn't find a motive.
          Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned?
          Did   she know something someone wished
          she   didn't? Was it about business?
                         BLOMKVIST
          Business?   She was sixteen.
                        MORELL
          And very bright. Henrik told me he
          could easily imagine her running the
          business someday, which would mean
          someone else wouldn't.


                        BLOMKVIST
          She was with some friends that day.
          At a parade. You must have talked to
          them.

                        MORELL
          She told them she wasn't feeling
          well. She left early. But they also
          said she kept secrets from them, too.
          The main thing I learned talking to
          them for hours is that teenage girls
          are complicated.
                         BLOMKVIST
          I have one.

                        MORELL
          So you know.
               (Blomkvist does indeed)
          Did you bring the last gift Henrik
          received?

                        BLOMKVIST
          It's at the National Forensic Lab.

                        MORELL
          I can tell you what their report
          will say now: It's a flower common
          to Europe. All of them are. No
          prints. No DNA.
He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I wanted to ask you about this.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.
                                                       37.
                                                       37.
                       Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

                        MORELL
          She received this from Henrik the
          Christmas before. I studied it more
          times than I can say. I know every
          page of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's the last page I'm curious about.
                        MORELL
          As was I.

                        BLOMKVIST
          The only names not alphabetized.
Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018

                        MORELL
          They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I've reminded you of things you'd
          rather forget. I'm sorry.

                        MORELL
          I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
          Case.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.

                        MORELL
          Every policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Was this also a missing girl case?
                                                             38.
                                                             38.
    

                             MORELL
               No, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.
     And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.
78   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                      78

     An unexciting social welfare building.

79   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY                               79

     As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander
     reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking
     that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding
     ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned.

                             BJURMAN
               How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was
               told he had a stroke of some kind.
                    (nothing from Salander)
               Terrible.

     It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs
     through her file -
                             BJURMAN
               What exactly do you do at this
               security company?

                             SALANDER
               Make coffee and sort mail.

                             BJURMAN
               But not full-time. Not even part-
               time consistently. They somehow got
               along without coffee or mail in July
               and August?

     Nothing from her.
                             BJURMAN
               How much do you earn there?

                             SALANDER
               Enough.

                             BJURMAN
               How much is your rent?
                                                       39.
                                                       39.
                       Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

                        SALANDER
          I pay my rent.

                        BJURMAN
          When's the last time you were late?
                        SALANDER
          Never.
                        BJURMAN
          Do you think that ring in your eyelid
          makes you attractive?

Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all
her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
                        BJURMAN
          Here's the problem. There a
          discrepancy between the obligation of
          Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the
          management of your finances.

                        SALANDER
          It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
          It was clear to him I could manage my
          own finances.
                        BJURMAN
          But that's not clear to me.
                        SALANDER
          I'm not a child.

                         BJURMAN
          No.  You're not.
                (looks at her too long)
          But you were. And between then and
          now -
                (indicating the files)
          - two years in the locked ward at
          St. Stephens, for violent aggression -
          failure to adapt to four foster homes
          and seven schools - arrested twice
          for intoxication, twice for narcotics
          use, and most recently for assault:
          a bottle smashed into a man's face.
          You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
          thinking you've improved, but looking
          at this -
                (the file)
          - not to mention how you're looking
          at me now - I can see you haven't.
          So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are
          over. Starting now, you'll be given
          a monthly allowance. You'll provide
          me with receipts for your expenses.

                                                              40.
                                                              40.
     
                              BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                If the numbers don't balance, I'll
                have to assume the difference is
                going to drugs.

                              SALANDER
                I've been on my own since I was
                twelve.
                              BJURMAN
                No. You've been a persistent burden
                to the State since you were twelve.

      She won't look at him any more - not that there's
      anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.
                              BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                Ms. Salander? Please look at me.
                Because this is important.
      She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.

                              BJURMAN
                This behavior you're displaying
                right now is elaborately documented
                here -
                     (in the file)
                - so it would come as a shock to no
                one if I chose an alternative to the
                lenient arrangement I just outlined.
                Is that what you're saying with your
                silence? You'd prefer
                institutionalization?
79A   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                     79A
      Salander steps into the elevator, hits the down button.
      As the doors close -

80    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING                              80

      Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road
      Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like
      all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by
      an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.
                              LIV
                Mikael?
                     (he manages a nod)
                We're going to the same place.
                Hop in.

81    EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - EVENING                             81

      Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his
      dinner guests on the porch.
                                                             41.
                                                             41.
     

                             LIV
               I found him at death's door halfway
               up the hill.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.

                             MARTIN
               No, it's a climb for anyone. I
               should've warned you. Come on in.

     Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82

     The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
     Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has
     prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
                             LIV
               I used to work in the company's
               petrochemical division in Goteborg.
               When it was sold, I went with it.
                             MARTIN
               A dark day.

                             LIV
               I live in Hong Kong now, but come
               back to Stockholm for family events,
               and when I do, I drive up to spend a
               couple days with Martin.
                             MARTIN
               She comes for the moose steak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Is that what this is?

     They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange,
     wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine
     in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
                             MARTIN
               Something's open. You like this one,
               or would you like to try something
               else?

                             BLOMKVIST
               That one's good.

     Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv,
     left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
                             LIV
               I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
                                                             42.
                                                             42.
  

                        BLOMKVIST
          That was a dark day.

                        LIV
          Sorry to remind you of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's okay. There are worse things
          than libel - though I can't
          immediately think of one in my
          business.

                        LIV
          You're writing a book now, Martin
          said.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Henrik's biography.
                        LIV
          I love Henrik. He's fascinating.
          Martin, too. Together they're the
          Old Sweden and the New.

                          BLOMKVIST
          They are.
                        LIV
          You know about Harriet, right?

Blomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops.
                          LIV
          You don't?

                          BLOMKVIST
          I do.

Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in
hand and returns with it to the dining room.
                        LIV O/S
          The family doesn't like to talk about
          it, but it can't just be swept under
          the rug.

                          MARTIN
          What can't.

                          LIV
          Harriet.

Martin doesn't comment.    Just nods.    Silence.   Then -
                                                       43.
                                                       43.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Maybe we could talk about that
          later.

                        MARTIN
          We can talk about it now.
               (Blomkvist glances to Liv)
          Liv knows everything about my crazy
          family. Which is why she'll never
          marry me.

                        LIV
          That's one reason.

She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it.
The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not
unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
                        MARTIN
          Don't put that in your book.
          Anything else is fine. Harriet
          certainly. Everything changed after
          that. Not just the family, but the
          company.

                        BLOMKVIST
          How so.

                        MARTIN
          We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but
          we're still the largest family-owned
          company in the country. At the
          height, we had 40,000 employees. We
          have about half that now, and that
          downward slide - anyone can tell you -
          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
          spirit, and his heart.

And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as
innocently as possible -

                        BLOMKVIST
          You were here that day?

                        MARTIN
          Everyone was here, though I didn't
          get in until after the accident on
          the bridge. The 4:30 train.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I know it well.
                                                              44.
                                                              44.
      

                             MARTIN
               It was a terrible day. And the days
               after - searching and not finding her
               - were even worse.

                             MARTIN
               This event, Mikael, has to be a
               big part of your book.

     Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
83   INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY                                 83

     As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
     subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
     her messenger bag from her shoulder -
     She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
     junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
     but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
     escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
     the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.

     She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
     junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
     wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
     and disappears into the underground station.
84   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                     84

     Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
     Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
     a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...

     A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
     of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
     a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
                            CECILIA
               Hi. I thought I'd come over and say
               hello. I'm Cecilia.

85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                         85
     Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the
     wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post-
     It next to it that reads: Recent Photo?
     INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager,
     and a Post-It with her name on it.

                             CECILIA
               We're all uncomfortable with the
               idea of a chronicle of our family.
                                                          45.
                                                          45.
  

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not about the family. It's
           about Henrik and the company.

                          CECILIA
           Like I said.

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not my intention to present a
           malicious portrait of anyone.

                         CECILIA
           Unlike the one that landed you in
           court.
                         BLOMKVIST
           Unlike that one. Correct.
                         CECILIA
           So, what you're saying is, you're
           not really here to look into what
           happened to Harriet.

Silence.   Then -

                         BLOMKVIST
           I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
           but no, that's not by any means my
           focus.
                         CECILIA
           So all those boxes Gunner carted
           down here - which are where? - in the
           closet now? - weren't Henrik's
           private investigation.
                (Blomkvist can't think fast
                 enough to respond)
           I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my
           Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Since we're talking about it, since
           you brought it up, what was Harriet
           like?

                         CECILIA
           I'm sure Henrik has told you.
                         BLOMKVIST
           He was my age then, and so couldn't
           know what was really going on with a
           teenager any more than I can with my
           own daughter. You were her age.
                                                             46.
                                                             46.
     

                           CECILIA
             Actually, my sister Anita was closer
             to her in age.

INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she
was about 17 years old.

                           CECILIA
             She knew Harriet better than anyone -
             certainly better than I did. You
             should talk to her.

                           BLOMKVIST
             I'd love to, where is she.
                           CECILIA
             If I had to guess - London.
                           BLOMKVIST
             You don't know where your own sister
             lives?

                           CECILIA
             I haven't seen her in years.       We
             never really got along.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'm getting used to that comment.

                           CECILIA
             That's the way it is when you're
             always after the same boys.

                           BLOMKVIST
             People generally get over that sort
             of thing at a certain point.

                           CECILIA
             Oh, I'm long over it, and won't
             ever have to worry about it again.
             She hates this place even more than
             I do. She left, moved to London and
             that was it. You couldn't pay her to
             send a Christmas card, much less
             visit.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'll try to track her down for you.

                             CECILIA
             Don't bother.
                           BLOMKVIST
             For myself then.

He smiles.    She studies him.      Maybe he's not so bad.
                                                               47.
                                                               47.
       

                             CECILIA
               If you do, and try talking to her
               about us, don't be surprised if she
               tells you to fuck off.

                             SECRETARY V/O
               I'm sorry, he's booked all day.

                             SALANDER
               It'll take five minutes.      It's
               important.

                               SECRETARY V/O
               Hold, please.
     Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they
     always do. The secretary comes back on.

               Seven o'clock.

     Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise

     guardian's office door.

89   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               89
     As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits.
     The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she
     has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops.

                             BJURMAN
               Have you ever had an STD?
                    (nothing from her)

                        BJURMAN (CONT'D)
               (nothing)
          How many partners have you had in the
          last month?
               (nothing)
          How many were men?
That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her.
                        BJURMAN
          I'm required to ask you these things.
          It's a matter of health.

                        SALANDER
          Write down anything you want.
Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the
McJesus invoice again.
                        BJURMAN
          Why do you need such an expensive
          computer?

                        SALANDER
          For work.

                        BJURMAN
          Making coffee and sorting mail.

                        SALANDER
          I shouldn't even have to ask. I
          should have control of my money like
          before.

                        BJURMAN
          And you will. Once you show me you
          can be sociable and get along with
          people. Can you do that?
               (nothing from her)
          Shall we start with me?
               (pause)
          Shall we start now?

As he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter
opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a
child has painted with the word, `daddy.'
                        BJURMAN
          If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to
          you. That's how normal people are.

He stands in front of her, his crotch at her eye level.
                        BJURMAN
          You've done this before.   You know
          what to do.

                    (she doesn't do anything)
               Do you want this computer or not?

     He takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his
     trousers.
                             BJURMAN
               You feel that? That's gaberdine.

                    (she doesn't move; he smiles)
               I like the reticence. I prefer a
               whore who pretends she isn't. It's
               almost convincing.
     He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him.

     Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private

     calmly writing a check.

               Here you go.   As promised.

     He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it,
     pulls it back a little.

                             BJURMAN
               I know you're not thinking about
               telling anyone about our date. Enjoy

     Blomkvist approaches a desk.       The brass name plate on it
     reads, Anita Vanger.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Excuse me. I'm sure I should have
               made an appointment.

                               ANITA
               It's fine.    Please.     Have a seat.

     The accent is all British. She's been here much longer
     than her home country. No trace of Swedish anymore. He
     offers his hand -

               I'm Mikael.

               Mikael.   How do you do.

     As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ...

                             ANITA
               You're looking for investment
               counseling, Mikael?
                             BLOMKVIST

               I'm writing a biography of your
               uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
     She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia
     predicted, but it doesn't come.

     They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.
                             ANITA
               How is Henrik?
                              BLOMKVIST
               Good.   Engaging. I like him.

     She does, too.
                                             51.
                                             51.
             Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

              ANITA
I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
Or my sister. Or anyone else in my
family.
              BLOMKVIST
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that, so your recollections
are valid.

              ANITA
I wouldn't know where to start, if
that was a question.

              BLOMKVIST
I can narrow it. I've gotten up to
the 1960s. To the event that altered
everything in Henrik's life.
              ANITA
Harriet.
     (he nods)
Everything I knew about that I told
to - whatever his name was - that
policeman - when it happened.
             BLOMKVIST
Morell.

              ANITA
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.

              BLOMKVIST
I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like. Particularly,
toward the end.

              ANITA
She was messed up. Like all us
Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken
father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi
like mine.

              BLOMKVIST
Was he abusive?

             ANITA
Mine?
             BLOMKVIST
Hers.
                                                            52.
                                                            52.
    

                             ANITA
               I never saw it myself, but you could
               tell something was going on. One day
               she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd
               be putting on makeup and wearing the
               tightest sweater she had to school.
               The next she'd be studying a Bible
               like a nun - no Vanger was ever
               religious - can you imagine?
               Obviously, she was very unhappy.

                             BLOMKVIST
               She never confided in you what about,
               specifically?
                             ANITA
               There was no specifically. It was
               everything. It was being part of
               that family. Henrik's the only
               decent person in it.

                             BLOMKVIST
               What do you think happened to her?

                             ANITA
               Everyone knows what.
                             BLOMKVIST
               But you have no ... thoughts about
               why, or who.
                             ANITA
               All I know is I always felt sorry
               for her. Even more than for myself.
               I got out of there when I was 18 and
               never went back. She would have done
               the same but didn't make it to 18.
96   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                     96

     Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she
     wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She
     scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects.
                             SALANDER
               Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth
               Salander.
                    (the call is put through)
               ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed
               our appointment. I had a lot of work
               ... no, nothing to be concerned about
               ... I need another advance on my
               allowance. Can I come to your office
               tonight? ... I don't need a pen,
               what's the address?
                                                                 53.
                                                                 53.
         

97    EXT/INT. HEDEBY ISLAND - TAXI - MOVING - DUSK                97

      The taxi that first brought him here to the island,
      crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle
      Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
98    EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    98

      Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung
      over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
      As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.

                                 BJURMAN O/S
                   Yes?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's me.

      The door buzzes.     She pushes it open.
99    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    99
      She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread.
      Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe.
                                 BJURMAN
                   Come on in.

100   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                       100

      She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining
      area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door.

                                 BJURMAN
                   Like it?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's nice.

                                 BJURMAN
                   It's home.
                        (pause)
                   So, what do you need money for this
                   time? Grand Theft Auto 5?

                                 SALANDER
                   Food.
      He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin.
                                BJURMAN
                   How are you? Been thinking about
                   last time? Decided you wanted to see
                   me again?
                                                                54.
                                                                54.
       

                               SALANDER
                 I just want my money.

                               BJURMAN
                 Well, let's see if I can help you out
                 with that.

       He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
       his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the
       bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.

                               SALANDER
                 Wait.

       She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
       Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She
       knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
                               BJURMAN
                 Is there a problem?

                               SALANDER
                 I just want to know, am I going to
                 have to do this every time I need
                 money to eat?
                               BJURMAN
                 It's so cute when you do that surly
                 thing. Take my hand
       She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's
       a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other
       to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out.
       He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into
       unconsciousness.
100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100A

       She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to
       the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
       with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
       starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her
       underwear.
                                BJURMAN
                 Please.   I have neighbors.

       He lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age
       music.

                               BJURMAN
                 What we're going to do now is teach
                 you the value of money.

       He watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere.
       He tears open a condom package with his teeth.
                                                                 55.
                                                                 55.
         

                               BJURMAN
                 I forget - did I ask you before if
                 you liked anal sex?

       He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top
       of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
       do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
       inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;
       it's the only place to go in such situations.

101    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                       101

       The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
       He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
       photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
       up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
       Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:

                               HARRIET V/O
                 Faith is the assurance of things
                 hoped for, the evidence of things not
                 seen. Through faith we understand
                 that the world was created by the
                 word of God - and that what is seen
                 was not made of things that are
                 visible ...

       He sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his
       daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is
       depressing.
101A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN                           101A
       Dawn light outside the living room window.

       Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange
       juice, writing out a check.

       In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket,
       shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.
                               BJURMAN
                 I'll drive you home.
                               SALANDER
                 I can get home on my own.

                                 BJURMAN
                 Are you sure?

       It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine
       concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens
       the door for her like a perfect gentleman.

                               BJURMAN
                 So, next Saturday, here?
                                                               56.
                                                               56.
       

      She nods.   Leaves.   The door closes.

102   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAWN                                     102

      A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
103   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          103

      She sets a check down. On the memo line he's neatly
      written, "for food." She takes a bottle of water from
      the fridge and drinks.

104   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          104

      Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder
      blade and runs down past several others. By the time the
      water reaches the drain it has turned red.
105   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                                  105

      Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist
      sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.

106   EXT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                        106

      Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
      A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers
      it a crack.

                                ERIKA
                  Is it any warmer inside?
                                 BLOMKVIST
                  No.

107   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                        107

      As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going,
      using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps
      herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with
      the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  What have I missed besides you?
                                ERIKA
                  The steady exodus of two-thirds of
                  our advertisers.

                                 BLOMKVIST
                  Seriously?

                                ERIKA
                  Is that hard to believe? Sitting up
                  here in Lappland with your cat?
                                                                57.
                                                                57.
        

                               BLOMKVIST
                I'm not.   I'm working.

                                ERIKA
                I can see.
      What she can see is the Vanger research covering the
      walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the
      family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Would you like to meet him?

                              ERIKA
                Maybe in about an hour.      If you're
                interested.

      He is.
108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108

      Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat
      with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.

                              VANGER
                I apologize if you're having
                financial problems at the magazine
                in Mikael's absence.
                              ERIKA
                We'll work through them.
                                VANGER
                Are you sure?

      Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them
      about this.

                              MARTIN
                How long do you think you can hang
                on? Six months or so?
                              ERIKA
                That sounds about right.

                              VANGER
                     (cheerfully)
                You know, I used to be in the
                newspaper business. We owned six
                dailies back in the 50's.
                              MARTIN
                We still own one. The Courier, here
                in town.
                                                          58.
                                                          58.
  

                         VANGER
           I let my nephew Birger run it since
           he can't run anything else.

Erika nods politely.
                         MARTIN
           So what do you say to taking on a
           partner?

                         ERIKA
           We've never considered it before.
           We value our independence.

                         MARTIN
           Your independence is dependant on
           advertisers - if we're being honest.
           However much you think that is, you'd
           retain. We don't care about content.

Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a
party.

                          BLOMKVIST
           Excuse me.   Did I miss something?
                         VANGER
           We're talking about an investment in
           the magazine.
                           BLOMKVIST
           I gather.    Why would you want to do
           that?

                         MARTIN
           Not for the return, that's for sure.

                         VANGER
                (to Erika)
           I feel bad that I've take Mikael
           away from you at the worst possible
           time. This is the right thing to do.
           The moral thing. That's one reason.

                          ERIKA
           And.
                         VANGER
           The enemies of my friends are my
           enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much
           as you hate what he's done to you.
Silence.

                         VANGER
           So what do you say?
                                                                 59.
                                                                 59.
         

      Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.

                                VANGER
                  Is that a maybe?
      She nods.

                                 VANGER
                  Wonderful!   More wine, Anna.

      Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.



                                VANGER
                  I think Mikael is adapting well to
                  rustic life, by the way.
                                ERIKA
                  Have you seen him try to make a fire?

                                VANGER
                  Put the logs on end, like this.

      He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.
109   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT                                109

      Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  How long have you been discussing
                  this with them?
                                ERIKA
                  I haven't been. They asked me to
                  come up yesterday.

                                BLOMKVIST
                  Why didn't you tell me?
                                 ERIKA
                  Why would I.   You live in the woods.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  So I deserve to be treated like an
                  idiot?

                                ERIKA
                  I wanted to hear what they had to
                  say. You would've said no before
                  they could.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  I'm saying it now. It's not a good
                  idea.
                                                             60.
                                                             60.
     

                              ERIKA
                You heard me tell them we could
                hang on for six months. I was lying.
                Without their money we'll be out of
                business in three.
                              BLOMKVIST
                You don't know this family.   They're
                crazy.

                              ERIKA
                We're not marrying into it.

                              BLOMKVIST
                We are if we do this. It's exactly
                what we're doing.

                              ERIKA
                You want to say no? Let's say no.
                Instead of 50 percent of something,
                let's own 100 percent of nothing.

      The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up,
      comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears
      into the bedroom. He stares at the fire.
                                 ERIKA O/S
                Mikael?

                                 BLOMKVIST
                What.

                              ERIKA O/S
                I'm leaving this God-forsaken island
                in the morning.
                                 BLOMKVIST
                So?

                              ERIKA
                So are you coming to bed or not.

110   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY                                110

      Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed
      wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers.
                              TATTOO ARTIST
                You thinking one arm or both?
                              SALANDER
                Wrists and ankles. But none of
                these. Just a plain band, like
                handcuffs.
                                                               61.
                                                               61.
       

                              TATTOO ARTIST
                It's sensitive there. Particularly
                the ankles. It's gonna hurt.

      That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her
      sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun.

                              SALANDER
                How much do one of those cost?

                Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger
                Industries has acquired a controlling
                interest in Millennium magazine which
                according to analysts has been in
                financial trouble since last December
                when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist
                was found guilty of libel against
                Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -

      A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office,
      where a reporter interviews her -

                              ERIKA
                We made a serious mistake last year,
                and we regret it. But we're moving
                forward, and this is the first step.

                              REPORTER 2
                You wouldn't say the first step was
                your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?

                              ERIKA
                That's inaccurate. Read the original
                press release, Viggo. I didn't fire
                him. He's on sabbatical.
                               REPORTER 2
                Where.

                              ERIKA
                I'm not sure, to be honest with you.

      He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the
      album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
                                                                62.

      They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted
      the approximate time of day of each.

      The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by
      family members of each other. The next couple taken in
      town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the
      bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and
      glances out to see a television news van driving toward
      Vanger's manor -

      A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing
      Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a
      cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on.

                              MARTIN
                Millennium is an excellent magazine.
                We also think it's undervalued right
                now, which is good business for us.

                              REPORTER 3
                Is any magazine really undervalued
                today. How many will be around
                tomorrow?

                              VANGER
                There's another reason.      I don't like
                bullies.
                              REPORTER 3
                Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
                              VANGER
                I'm referring to anyone who tries
                to sue their enemies into submission.
                If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try
                it again, he'll find himself fighting
                a company that can afford to fight
                back.

                years.

      As a clerk rings up the   items Salander is buying -
      bright yellow duct tape   and a plastic protective mask -
      she watches a shot on a   TV here of Wennerstrom being
      interviewed outside his   offices -
                                                                63.

                              WENNERSTROM ON TV
                I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
                He's a titan - and a gentleman. But
                he's also quite old now - which may
                explain how he could be taken in by
                a convicted liar.

      The report segues to another story.     The clerk hands
      Salander her receipt.
