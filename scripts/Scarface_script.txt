         1       A PROLOGUE                                                     1

                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the
                              time the port was closed 125,000
                              'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal
                              records.   This is the story of that
                              minority -- those they call 'Los
                              Bandidos.'

      We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
      then.   We move to the eyes, pure in their fury.  Finally we

      muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
      on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.

      cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
      prison.

           eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
           He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

           Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out

      . . . the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid.
      a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra -
      Madre.     It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking
      to himself just before the bandits get him....

      The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
      the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
      eyes in cat-like repose...to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an
      eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

                                          BOGART
                                                   What a thing.
                        Conscience.    Conscience.

         He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
         imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
         zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
         Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
         pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
         And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
         more pronounced.

        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack

            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
                                                            VOICE
                             Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.
                                                            TONY

     Tony     winks    and   walks   off.

     The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or
     Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack.  Tony loves the
     sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling
     his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny
     and Angel.

            A     bewildered        Emilio    Rebenga     grabs     his   papers     and       valuables.

            Manny runs up on him.
            Rebenga sees him, senses danger,                      flees   down the aisle            with
            his satchel, intersecting other                       panicked refugees.

            Manny      follows.
            Rebenga stumbles into a                   bed frame, shatters his glasses,
            then runs on.   Into the                  smoke and flame.  Out of which
            Scarface   now appears --                 in his killing wrath.

       Tony waves    her off, then changes his mind and runs up
       behind her    and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
       Before she    can react, he hops away laughing as the two

       provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a
       shop window.

       Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm
       and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
       give a shit.

                       Come     on?
       Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
       car screeching to a halt in front of him.

                                                  TONY

                       Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff.
       The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window.

       Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches
       her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

       She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
       Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

       Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
       child, four, toddling along with it's'mom.  Be makes his
       own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
       him puzzled. Tony produces another face.   The kid now
       smiles.  The mother looks over.  Tony shrugs.  She smiles
       and moves along.

       Meanwhile,       Manny    has     moved     close      to    the    blonde    and   suggests
       something,    his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It
       takes a    moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
       and walks        away.
       Tony     walks    over     to     him,    mocking.

           The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
           casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
           around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

           The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors
           and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every

           table is taken.
           family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night
           watering hole for various beasts of prey.
           The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
           to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
           camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
           and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
           this dungeon....

           Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
           exhausted.      A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
           to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

           diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
           They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with
           friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
           Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and

     Omar Suarez (El Mono -- "The Monkey") is so named 'cause he
     looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
     intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
     between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon
     from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
     wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with
     him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.
     In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,
     flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

     as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move

     The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
     Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
     playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
     street.
     The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
     rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
     jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
     needing paint.   You'd arrest these guys on sight.

            salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely.
            Driving is Manny.   In the delapidated backseat are Angel,
            the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

            blocking    her     off.

     The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-
     inch Columbian, "The Toad". He's in his forties, sports
     shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on
     his face, like Omar; he's good-natured, a nice guy, he
     smiles.

     blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the
     windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating
     he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not

     The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
     Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,
     and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the
     Toad, about five-two.
     The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

                            (slang Spanish)
                   Don't!    Get up! Now shithead!
       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl
       or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair
       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard
       in fast Columbese slang.
       As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

                                   TONY
                   Frog face, you just fucked up.     You
                   steal from me, you're dead.
       Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

                                   TOAD
                   Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the
                   cash or am I gonna kill your brother
                   first?  'Fore I kill you?
                                   TONY
                   Try sticking your head up your ass.
                   See if it fits.
       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

       Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across

       Manny paces outside the car, glances.

     A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
     parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
     sees nothing, casually goes back in.

     Manny    looks     at   his     watch.

     Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the
     shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the
     bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

     Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
     bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
     pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
     Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're
     dead     and they know it.

     Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and
     extension cord.

                                                TOAD
                                 (to Tony)
                       You watch what happens to your friend
                       okay?  If you don't want this to
                       happen to you, you get the money.

     Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who
     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.
     The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly
     towards Angel.
     The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his
     brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the
     chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

     The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his
     shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances
     at Tony.

     A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a
     strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a
     terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

     Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel.   They

     The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched
     with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.
     Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily
     dotting his eyes.
                                 TOAD
                 Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die
                 too. Makes no difference to me.
     He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
     lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
     his blood, piss dead.

     pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to

     At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens....

     The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

     Tony,     devastated,            spits      in     his     face.

                     Go       fuck      yourself.
     Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

     Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

     Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's
     wrist.

     The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a
     gunshot from the hall.

45   INT./EXT.       TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.
     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.
                                                                                     c0NT1NuED

     Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

     Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
     craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

     Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

                                                    TONY

     Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who
     is still twitching.
     Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.

     The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
     in astonishment.
     As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,
     chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

     Their      eyes       follow.

     As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
     in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
     There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
     that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

     Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.
     The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then
     an old lady faints.
     The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
     turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
     audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
     and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-

     A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security
     and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury
     items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes
     quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

     The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,
     dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
     preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
     effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now
     Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the
     heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and
     bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

          .We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
          out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis,
          Lamberghinis and Corniches   in a long snaking line down the

          jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening

          coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in

          The interior is built like three or four plush apartments
          that run together on three separate levels with imaginative
          angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band,
          hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games,
          computers and a restaurant. Itrs a lavish fun spot that
          will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven
          and nighttime capital of South America.

          The crowd, a combination of                  Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
          young, rich and happy and a                  lot of them coked; the girls,

     The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
     hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
     and high heels.

     Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
     necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

     Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
     tough-looking tank tops with "Motherfuckah" and "Fuck Me"
     written on them.  Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to
     pick one of them up.

     A Man passes the table.      Lopez calls out.

               Hey, George -- buddy.

               Hey, Frank.. -how's         the case coming?
     The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-
     lidded,  cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigar-
     ette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable
     with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.
                               LOPEZ
               OY, I shoulda come to you 'stead of
               that putz, Neufeld.
                               SHEFFIELD
               Jack's a good lawyer.   I taught him
               everything he knows.
                                  LOPEZ
               Yeah, almost    everything.

                       (to Elvira)
               Elvira, you look terrific...
                       (to all)
               Enjoy .yourselves.
     He ambles off.

               I . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami.

          It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the                                floor, leading
          Elvira.   It's not so much an act of walking                             as it is an act
          of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody                               off that gets
          in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight                               dead line, eyes
          forward.   It's not that he doesn't see the                              people he bumps
          off, it's that he couldn't care less.

                smoking his cigar, feeling good.
