Disillusioned and desperate following the results of the 2004 presidential election, best friends Casey (Pelletier) and Billie (Morse) stumble upon a way to swing the 2008 election. Through seduction and sexual manipulation, the underground organization that these women create sets out not only to sway the male Republican vote, but to create lifetime Democratic converts.
