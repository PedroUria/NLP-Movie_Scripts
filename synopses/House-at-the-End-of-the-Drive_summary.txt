Can a 46 year old mass-murder haunt four people enough to rip open a doorway to the past and catapult them back in time to the night of one of Hollywood's most horrible ritual slayings? The chatter of a quiet dinner party in posh Oxford Canyon is rudely interrupted as the real truths are set on the table. Fact and fiction intertwine as the couple's talk of ghosts and spirits from beyond which prompts them to take steps that will alter that night and their lives forever.::David Oman
