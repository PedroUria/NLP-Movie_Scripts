The Christmas Bunny is the story of a Michigan family, facing tough economic times, who take in a withdrawn foster child, Julia (Sophie Bolen). Convinced she's unlovable, Julia dreams of becoming "real," like the Velveteen Rabbit in her treasured storybook video. When a real-life rabbit is injured by her foster brother in an accident, Julia meets the Bunny Lady, a local recluse who cares for people's cast-away pets, and both their lives are changed by the encounter.::AJ
