Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was \n[74]someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later? \n[75]   \n[76]   \n[77]  \n[78]Hello, Ricki. \n[79]You missed a wedge. \n[80]Where've you been, Ricki? \n[81]Who is? \n[82]I'm going to try. How long have you been here? \n[83]I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it. \n[84]What do you want Ricki? \n[85]What woman? \n[86]  \n[87]You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? \n[88]Sense what? \n[89]  \n[90]What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing? \n[91]She had children in Russia? \n[92] \n[93]  \n[94]And what did your message say, Ricki? \n[95]What else? \n[96]I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something. \n[97]Yes. I quite see that. \n[98]And what else? \n[99]What happened next Ricki? \n[100]  \n[101]Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe. \n[102](grateful to get away \n[103]Yes. I didn't sleep well. I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. If you have the slightest reservation... \n[104]If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone. \n[105]Ricki's been helping us Peter. He's been telling us all about his adventures. \n[106]As you did take the trouble to steal it... \n[107]Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information? \n[108]What was the date? \n[109]November 20th is missing. Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? \n[110]Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. \n[111]You recognize that handwriting? That's Toby Esterhase. \n[112]Secrecy is a habit. \n[113]   \n[114]What for? \n[115] \n[116]In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them. \n[117]One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die. \n[118]Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there... \n[119]The Americans have had him tortured. \n[120]No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann. \n[121]I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov... \n[122] \n[123]Use my lighter. \n[124]\"We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she...\" \n[125]Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one.  So I go on. \"Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself,\" \"We're not so very different you and I..\" \n[126] \n[127]Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\" \n[128]Yes.  And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt. \n[129]That's the thing.  I can't remember. \n[130]After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time. \n[131] \n[132]You rang my house? \n[133]What did you say? \n[134]Go on. \n[135]The Saville. \n[136]Peter... \n[137]It's not him, Peter. \n[138] \n[139] \n[140]  \n[141]      \n[142]   \n[143] \n[144]    \n[145]Yes. Pleasant enough. \n[146]  \n[147]Which means I was...? \n[148]What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory? \n[149]But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why? \n[150]Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be? \n[151]What did you tell them? \n[152] \n[153]What was your last line of defence? \n[154]Why? \n[155]What else? \n[156]Did they ask about me at all? \n[157]What did he say about me? \n[158] \n[159]Try and put it all behind you, Jim. \n[160]Jim? \n[161] \n[162]He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor. \n[163]Toby Esterhase. \n[164]He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it. \n[165]Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about \"Tinker, Tailor?\" \n[166]Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had. \n[167]   \n[168] \n[169]Perfectly, Minister.  There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house. \n[170] \n[171]I'm glad you take some of the credit. \n[172]The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla. \n[173]Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that. \n[174]Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in. \n[175] \n[176]You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the \"gold\" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that? \n[177]We have one thing the Mole wants. \n[178] \n[179]Keep walking please. \n[180]I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience.
