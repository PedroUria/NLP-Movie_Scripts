And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.

Welcome aboard.  \n[115]I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea. \n[116]Elizabeth.  Hide the rum. \n[117]You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin. \n[118]Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.  \n[119]You look bloody awful. What are you \n[120]You *smell* funny. \n[121]Are you certain? Is that what you really want most? \n[122]Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.  \n[123]Well, there is a chest... \n[124]A chest of unknown size and origin.  \n[125]And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.  \n[126]With this. My Compass... is unique.  \n[127]True enough. This Compass does not point north. \n[128]It points to the thing you want most in this world. \n[129]Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? \n[130]By finding the chest of Davy Jones.  \n[131]Mister Gibbs! \n[132]We have our heading. \n[133]Miss Swann. \n[134]Agh. \n[135]Agh. \n[136]Of course. He wants the chest. \n[137]A truly discomforting notion, love.  \n[138]Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? \n[139]Friendly? \n[140]Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. \n[141]No. Persuade me. \n[142]As I said... Persuade me. \n[143]My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled. \n[144]You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! \n[145]Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us. \n[146]Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it. \n[147]One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist. \n[148]Uh my Compass works fine. \n[149]I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by. \n[150]All evidence to the contrary. \n[151]Do tell, dearie. \n[152]I *do* want to know what it tastes like.  \n[153]I want my jar of dirt. \n[154]Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt. \n[155]Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! \n[156]Move. \n[157]I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised. \n[158]How did you get here? \n[159]Not so easy, is it? \n[160]You do? \n[161]What? \n[162]Oh! Well... you're welcome, then. \n[163]Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  \n[164]Oy! What're you doing? \n[165]Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key. \n[166]I knew you'd warm up to me eventually. \n[167]Ah. The dark side of ambition. \n[168]Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? \n[169]Still rooting for you, mate! \n[170]Wup! \n[171]Oh. \n[172]Woah! \n[173]Oh, shut it. \n[174]Jar of dirt! \n[175]Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using \n[176]Uh, I say we respect his final wish.  \n[177]He fell behind. \n[178]I'll handle this, mate. \n[179]Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? \n[180]Got it! \n[181]Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it? \n[182]Hard to starboard. \n[183]Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.  \n[184]Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?  \n[185]Abandon ship. Into the longboat. \n[186]She's only a ship, mate. \n[187]We're not free yet, love. \n[188]Pirate. \n[189]Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...! \n[190]Come on...

Is that what you really want most? \n[122]Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.  \n[123]Well, there is a chest... \n[124]A chest of unknown size and origin.  \n[125]And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.  \n[126]With this. My Compass... is unique.  \n[127]True enough. This Compass does not point north. \n[128]It points to the thing you want most in this world. \n[129]Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not? \n[130]By finding the chest of Davy Jones.  \n[131]Mister Gibbs! \n[132]We have our heading. \n[133]Miss Swann. \n[134]Agh. \n[135]Agh. \n[136]Of course. He wants the chest. \n[137]A truly discomforting notion, love.  \n[138]Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? \n[139]Friendly? \n[140]Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. \n[141]No. Persuade me. \n[142]As I said... Persuade me. \n[143]My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled. \n[144]You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! \n[145]Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us. \n[146]Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it. \n[147]One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist. \n[148]Uh my Compass works fine. \n[149]I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by. \n[150]All evidence to the contrary. \n[151]Do tell, dearie. \n[152]I *do* want to know what it tastes like.  \n[153]I want my jar of dirt. \n[154]Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt. \n[155]Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! \n[156]Move. \n[157]I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised. \n[158]How did you get here? \n[159]Not so easy, is it? \n[160]You do? \n[161]What? \n[162]Oh! Well... you're welcome, then. \n[163]Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  \n[164]Oy! What're you doing? \n[165]Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key. \n[166]I knew you'd warm up to me eventually. \n[167]Ah. The dark side of ambition. \n[168]Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates? \n[169]Still rooting for you, mate! \n[170]Wup! \n[171]Oh. \n[172]Woah! \n[173]Oh, shut it. \n[174]Jar of dirt! \n[175]Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using \n[176]Uh, I say we respect his final wish.  \n[177]He fell behind. \n[178]I'll handle this, mate. \n[179]Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? \n[180]Got it! \n[181]Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it? \n[182]Hard to starboard. \n[183]Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.  \n[184]Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?  \n[185]Abandon ship. Into the longboat. \n[186]She's only a ship, mate. \n[187]We're not free yet, love. \n[188]Pirate. \n[189]Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...! \n[190]Come on... Come on... \n[191]Not so bad. \n[192]Oh! \n[193]Hello, beastie. ", "Cotton": "\n[1]Awk! Walk the plank! \n[2]Awk! \n[3]Rawk! Don't eat me! \n[4]Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk!  \n[5]Awk! Mind the boat! \n[6]Awk! Aye. ", "Pintel": "\n[1]And I say... it was me bein' *clever*. Ain't that right, poochie? \n[2]It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care? \n[3]You know you can't read. \n[4]Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya!  Look! There it is! \n[5]Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.  \n[6]Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha... ### \n[7]It's ours for the taking! \n[8]There's the truth of *it*! ### \n[9]Amen to that. \n[10]?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines! \n[11]?Unloose the mooring lines! \n[12]Well, how'd you get it back last time?  \n[13]We done it for you! Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us. \n[14]Mind the boat. \n[15]Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature? \n[16]Sums! \n[17]He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!  Could he? \n[18]What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones. \n[19]Welcome to the crew, former Commodore!  \n[20]You're pullin' too fast. \n[21]I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin.  \n[22]Aye. \n[23]Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken! \n[24]\"Mind the tide.\" \n[25]?Don't ?mind ?if I shine your shoes, Sir? \n[26]How'd this go all screwy? Enough! \n[27]Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny. \n[28]If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.  \n[29]'Ello, Poppet. \n[30]Sword! \n[31]Come on, Turner! \n[32]Aye! \n[33]You're pulling too hard! \n[34]She's on us! She's on us! \n[35]I think we've held fire long enough.  \n[36]'S a lot o' open wa'er. \n[37]He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.  \n[38]Aye. ", "Will": "\n[1]I don't know. You look beautiful. \n[2]No! \n[3]Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered... \n[4]More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him? \n[5]What mark did he leave on you? \n[6]Recover. At the point of a sword? \n[7]Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free. \n[8]So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl. \n[9]The property you want that he possesses.  \n[10]Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped. \n[11]Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me? \n[12]Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you. \n[13]Eagerly, if you'll still have me. \n[14]Keep a weather eye on the horizon. \n[15]What's wrong? The beach is right there.  \n[16]What? \n[17]Jack! Jack Sparrow! \n[18]Marty! Cotton! Anybody? \n[19]Ah! A familiar face! \n[20]I'm not gonna eat you. \n[21]Gibbs. \n[22]Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let's go! Euh! Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could do this all day! Euh! Euh! Hah! \n[23]Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say I'm glad to see you! \n[24]Jack! It's me! Will Turner! \n[25]Tell 'em to let me down. \n[26]Jack! The Compass! That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help *you*. She faces the gallows! \n[27]Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? *Jack...!* \n[28]Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief. \n[29]So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us. \n[30]Where's the rest of the crew? \n[31]Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we? \n[32]Come on men! It'll take all ?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl! \n[33]Hurry! \n[34]Stop! \n[35]?Move! \n[36]Cut it loose! Find a rock! \n[37]Roll the cage! \n[38]Lift the cage! Hurry! \n[39]What about Jack? I won't leave without him. \n[40]Time to go. \n[41]Jack. \n[42]Elizabeth is in danger. \n[43]She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*! \n[44]I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom. \n[45]What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste. \n[46]You want me to find this? \n[47]This... is going to save Elizabeth? \n[48]Not much. \n[49]Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?  \n[50]And the key will spare him that? \n[51]Her? \n[52]Mind the boat. \n[53]You know me? \n[54]What vexes all men? \n[55]What... exactly did he put into the chest? \n[56]You knew this. \n[57]It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman. \n[58]That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much. \n[59]I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key. \n[60]I cut down anyone in my path. \n[61]Sailor! \n[62]Sailor! \n[63]There's no use. You've run aground.  \n[64]Hey! Hey! \n[65]Get back! Back! \n[66]Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his \n[67]Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt. \n[68]Step aside! \n[69]I don't need your help! \n[70]So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion? \n[71]I've sworn no oath. \n[72]Not until I find this. The key. \n[73]What do you know of this? \n[74]So the captain has the key. \n[75]Where *is* the key? \n[76]Where is the chest? \n[77]I understand. Liar! \n[78]It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own. \n[79]What are they wagering? \n[80]So any crewman can be challenged? \n[81]I challenge Davy Jones. \n[82]My soul. An eternity of servitude.  \n[83]I want this. \n[84]That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away. \n[85]No! Don't do this. \n[86]Four fives. \n[87]Eight fives. \n[88]Fool. Why did you do that? \n[89]It was never about winning, or losing.  \n[90]It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either. \n[91]They'll know you helped me. \n[92]I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.  \n[93]Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can. \n[94]That dress. Where did you get it? \n[95]That's foolish. \n[96]I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there. \n[97]Or worse. \n[98]I've doomed us all.  It's the Flying \n[99]With good reason! \n[100]Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet. \n[101]But I do owe you thanks, Jack. \n[102]After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones. \n[103]I was reunited with my father. \n[104]I'm gonna kill Jones. \n[105]I keep the promises I make, Jack.
