Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right? \n[3]...and here's the jail here, see...? Escape chute for the Borian, he's a dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't take no shit neither. See, you can make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell, look, I played with it a little myself, I'm sorry. \n[4]Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you like the present. \n[5]Tell her I don't steal them locally. \n[6]Dear Ma: Filled out the child support stuff last week. Office got pissed, under ex-spouse I put \"Spawn of Satan, Dweller in Eternal Dark.\" Just being honest, Ma, lady wants me to die. \n[7]I'd go without a ripple, that's the truth. Ex-con. Ex-husband. Expired. Thanks, Ma, for hiding the truth from me for so long. Or maybe you believed in me. I miss you. I hope you believed, even for a day. No one did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold here. I'm sorry you're dead. Your son, Mitch. \n[8]Me. What's up? \n[9]Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let the fucker squeeze the Charmin. \n[10]Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay, she's in my car, what the hell is going on? \n[11]   \n[12]Hah? \n[13]Whatever. You cold? \n[14]Turn on the heater. It doesn't work, but it makes a very annoying noise which distracts from the cold. \n[15]You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my secretary used her feminine wiles. She's got two, one wile per side. Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em coming around a corner, you got time to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd dig her. Ah. Here we are. \n[16]Putting my glasses in my cooooat...\" \n[17]I sing what I do so I'll remember it. \"Turning off the downstairs liiiight...\" You know? \n[18]Do me a favor. Say, \"Always after me Lucky Charms.\" \n[19]Thanks. Just needed to hear that. \n[20]See anything you recognize? \n[21]Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a guy. \n[22]Another guy's address. Two addresses, is basically what I'm saying. \n[23]Anything else in there? \n[24]Yeah, well take a look at this. \n[25]Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck on the side, do you? \n[26]No, ma'am, it's just that... well, when we met you're all, \"Oh, fooey, I burned the darn cupcakes.\" Now, you go into a bar, ten minutes later sailors come running out, they can't take it. \n[27]What the hell...? Lemme check the scanner. \n[28]Why? \n[29]Where the shit did you get that? \n[30]Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill someone! Hey! \n[31]The diner...? That's half a mile away, are you fucking crazy? \n[32]How the fuck can you tell? \n[33]Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out eight months, I'm back doing skip traces, now you got me stealing fuckin' bicycles? \n[34]You. You're the matter. Look, you wanna keep going, good luck. I'm driving back to Ohio. You're free to come with me. \n[35]Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you *home*. \n[36]Yeah, matter of fact. Four years inside. Marion, Illinois, real shithole. Get in the car. \n[37]Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and my partner, we handled a lot of impounded shit. Fucker hated me, boy. One weekend, when he was conveniently gone...? Some bearer bonds disappeared from his office. And lo and behold, when the police responded to an anonymous tip, you'll never guess what just happened to be sitting in my closet. \n[38] \n[39]Now every dollar I hand my kid, he asks his mother did I steal it. \n[40]No more killing. \n[41]Nice crowd. \n[42]Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's a beaut. While you're doing her doggie- style you can pop the zits on her back. \n[43]Whoa. You remember your father? \n[44]Ms. Caine, last week at a party I ran into a girl I knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes. And it wasn't til I was driving home on the freeway that I remembered that I'd screwed her in the back of a car once. Everyone forgets. \n[45]No, see, all's I'm saying is you're not alone. \n[46]Fine. I gotta use the head. \n[47]Pork. On your nine. \n[48]So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside. \n[49]Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves. During that show with the little girl who's a robot. \n[50]How do you know? \n[51]You think I'm gonna shove it down my pants? Shoot my damn dick off. \n[52]Ho, ho. \n[53]*Jesus wept*...! \n[54]Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful. \n[55]*What happened to bulletproof*? \n[56]Got a tail. \n[57]Don't ask me, I just work here. Did you bump pelvises with him or not? \n[58]And you kid, Cathead -- \n[59]Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be the...? \n[60]Enough. You're giving me a stiffy. \n[61]Relax. She's with Luke. That's his name, Luke. \n[62]Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on what you told us. I had him call you an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be here within fifteen minutes. \n[63]The guy's story checks out. Sam knows things about him. Stuff only a lover would know. \n[64]Don't worry about it. Chick signs my checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced? Lie back down. \n[65]Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married with a kid. \n[66]How'd you know? \n[67]Tell me about Daedalus, what's his story? \n[68]Come again? \n[69]Where the hell...? I know I just heard that somewhere, something about a... \n[70]Oh, fuck. \n[71]Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in *his* leg. \n[72]Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew all that shit, not from *dating* him -- she *studied* the fucker to take him out! \n[73]   \n[74]         \n[75]Ah, that hurt like shit!! \n[76]Same as -- virgins, *what*...? \n[77]No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell \"pop goes the weasel,\" what the fuck are you talking about? Who are you?? \n[78]I'm confused. Gimme a minute. \n[79]Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight face. So then... Samantha, she... \n[80]Fabrication. And now she's just... gone? Forever and ever? \n[81]Pretty convincing act. \n[82]I mean, her personality, it had to come from *somewhere* -- \n[83]Drink up. What's next? \n[84]Chapter. Can you trust them? \n[85]...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's lost it and I want fucking out, now *call the Feds*. She's moving us tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the details. \n[86]All right, Charly. What did that accomplish? \n[87] \n[88]Whoa, time out. \n[89]\"Charly.\" fucking unbelievable. Shame about the fat ass. I bet you were really attractive once. \n[90]No. \n[91]Did he make good? \n[92]Your father was murdered. \n[93]Okay, what's going on? \n[94]You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time I got blown candy bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, so what's up? \n[95]Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? I think this is why you'd fuck me. To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any trace of her. \n[96]Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. When she comes back, give me a call. \n[97]Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and she's under the mistaken impression that Mommy gives a shit. \n[98]Saving your life. Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line. \n[99]What other guy -- ? \n[100]\n[101]Don't be so sure, others have tried. The entire population, in fact. Look, about me...? I mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, I'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore. \n[102]Dear Mom: I was tortured, now I'm in Atlantic City. The girl of my dreams just threw me out of a speeding car. Now more people will come an shoot me in the head. On the plus side, I won two bucks at video poker. \n[103]Found a use for me. \n[104]Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second while I pull it out of my ass. \n[105]What about it? \n[106]How would you know? Someone filed off the numbers. \n[107]What's in it? \n[108]Why me? \n[109]Shoulda known. Gimme the key. \n[110]Humor me: you're a paid assassin, then you fall off a cliff. Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened? \n[111]Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of that...? \n[112]No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it. I been there, you know. I'd kill for fucking amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I can think is I got reamed in the ass by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, here's a ball glove, did you know Daddy screamed when they carved the name in his back...? Mary, by the way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell. God, I'm tired. I never did one thing right, you know it, not one fucking thing. Not even accidental, that takes skill. \n[113] \n[114]  \n[115]Jesus wept. \n[116]Sure. It's not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid-air as you tripped and flew over the car. \n[117]Phone bill, Christmas card... Five buck, swell. You didn't have to kill him, you know. \n[118]What the hell was that? \n[119]Which phone? Where? \n[120]Shit. Service centers...! They list 'em on the back of phone bills, right? \n[121]Shut up and find me a gun. HK, MP-5. \n[122]Almost dark now. \n[123]Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing? We've got money, we could negotiate... \n[124]Not so emotional, I'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here. \n[125]Yeah? How come you know so much about this fucking guy? \n[126]I'm here. Suppose you tell me. \n[127]What's the matter? \n[128]Who? \n[129]Let me go in. \n[130]I get by. \n[131] \n[132]I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out more often. \n[133]  \n[134]Christ, lady, what are you doing in there, playing fucking mah-jongg? *Move*. \n[135]Are you fucking insane? You're talking about 10,000 people!! \n[136]I'll wait for you to rescue me. \n[137]Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds. \n[138]Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early. Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just watch. \n[139]Who? \n[140]The patsy. \n[141]Fuck you. \n[142]You foxy bitch. \n[143]Charly, you there? Hello, Charly. \n[144]Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you? \n[145]Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early. We got fifteen minutes. No more. \n[146]  \n[147]Hello...! Charly...? \n[148]All right, I'll go in and get her, you watch my back. \n[149]So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for? \n[150] \n[151]Piece of cake. \n[152]Gracias. \n[153]Dear Ma: I'm looking at the ants, they're pretty great. Some really funny ants here, Ma. All these funny ants, think I'll stay and watch 'em awhile... \n[154]  \n[155]Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof...? No, Caitlin, *don't check*. \n[156]I think that's yours... \n[157]Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...? \n[158]...funny thing...? You aren't going to die... I am... \n[159]Hey, gorgeous... know something... you got your mother's eyes... don't let... nobody tell you different... \n[160]Scared... to be nobody... without a ripple... please... remember me... ...Love you... ", "Luke": "\n[1] \n[2]I can't believe you don't remember dating me. Charly, please, you pursued me for months. \n[3]It's December, you'll remember. Right...? \n[4]Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call the poor bastard an ambulance! \n[5]Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it? ", "/Daedalus": "", "Perkins": "\n[1]This can't happen, Harry. The President's already up at night, prowling his sock drawer for double agents, and now we've got a fucking rogue on our hands. \n[2]Oh, for the love of Christ, who can be so fucking important? \n[3]*You*...! Are you crazy, coming here?? \n[4]What...? \n[5]Who is it? \n[6]Perkins. \n[7]Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm going to direct you to a safe house, get you on a plane -- \n[8]Charly, you're being paranoid. It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date. \n[9]Congress won't authorize a dime, Charly. Chapter's on the way out, we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we *don't have enough money to kill you*, understand...? \n[10]Your way, I see. And if I say go to hell? \n[11]She mustn't threaten our success. Contain her, whatever it takes. But be *careful*. If it gets out you're working for me... we'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn. \n[12]She mustn't suspect a trap. \n[13]God. We're monsters, aren't we...? Forget Charly. Talk to me about tonight. \n[14]That...? Something to prove that I'm not a complete ogre. \n[15]See? The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas. Very popular item. It... well, it pees. You put water in it and... oh, fuck you. \n[16]You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules of the game anymore. \n[17]Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets. \n[18]Interesting theory. \n[19]It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing...? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job. \n[20]No. This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. This time the terrorists can't muck it up... because we've killed them and taken over. \n[21]  \n[22]Continue dying. Out. \n[23]Anthony, get me the President... \n[24]Charly, I know we've treated you poorly, please, it was just business -- \n[25]You... you promise. \n[26]It's done.

We're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but I wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat. \n[53]Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it. \n[54]We'll be gone by then, Mitch. \n[55]Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed. \n[56]Me. Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter. \n[57]Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find...? \n[58]Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst... The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now. \n[59]Charly's stash. What's the number of the locker, Mitch...? \n[60]Left nut, five bucks I make it. \n[61]Move it out of here, now! \n[62]I tried to give you a pretty death, baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked, now it's ground beef time. \n[63] \n[64]Oh, spare me. You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in what's left of your face. \n[65]  \n[66]All units converge. Divert local law, this is a government matter. Brook no interference, I want the Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's the fucking chopper*? \n[67]Call it four minutes to detonation. I got a chopper on the way, lots of time. \n[68]You'll feel me. \n[69]You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles never recovered from C-section, I'll bet. Am I right? \n[70]She's a worthless bitch. I know it 'cause she came out of me. \n[71]It's called shock, Charly... Your body wants to go into shock... \n[72]Look at you. You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie. \n[73]Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse. Just bring me around and hold her steady. I'm not leaving until I know the bitch is dead. \n[74]Where are *you* going?? \n[75]*Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*! ", "Nathan": "\n[1]Alice, please...? \n[2]Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive. \n[3]It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. *Wouldn't you agree*? \n[4]Hello? \n[5]Who... who is this? \n[6]...Charly...? \n[7]God, it really is you...!? Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks -- \n[8]You don't know your name. \n[9]Your full name... is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore. \n[10] \n[11]Charly, don't talk, just listen: We have to meet, understand? We have to meet *right away*. \n[12]A former student... is in trouble. \n[13]Get in! Both of you, NOW! \n[14]   \n[15]Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*. \n[16]What in God's hell have you been *eating*, you look positively bovine! Hang on. \n[17]Bulletproof. Put it in myself. \n[18]  \n[19]Charlene, darling -- \n[20] \n[21]Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher, that was your cover! Your memory was gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio housewife business, it's a fantasy, you *wrote* the bloody thing! \n[22]Then quit. You're an assassin for the United States government. I ought to know, I trained you. \n[23]  \n[24]*The side windows were next, I swear*. \n[25]  \n[26]Here, you might as well have one too. \n[27]Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr. Wally -- Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin. \n[28]Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest. \n[29]Your father was in the British SIS, assigned to the Irish situation. After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the U.S. State Department. \n[30]Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down. You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus. You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier. \n[31]I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I can't drive around in this thing. Any idea where we can go to stash this car? \n[32]Perhaps you'd best drive. \n[33]Let me do it. \n[34]*No ambulance*. The car I ordered will be here soon. \n[35]I'm about to faint... And if you call an ambulance, I will fucking kill you. \n[36]Where's Charly...? \n[37]Goddammit, I told you -- \n[38]Sod that... just watch them. \n[39]Checks. You're not fooling anyone, dear boy. You'd wash her feet and drink the water... wouldn't you? \n[40]My star pupil... That man in Pennsylvania yesterday... The one at the diner, that was hers, wasn't it...? \n[41] \n[42]Arms broker, man without a face. Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades. He's rumored to be based in the U.S. Doesn't travel much, they say. Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg. \n[43]A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin. \n[44]You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus! ", "#2": "\n[1]That's who? \n[2]Swear? \n[3]Too weird. \n[4]Oui, j'veux etirer celle-la autour d'une chaise. Comme je le vois, une femme c'est comme Gumby avec des seins. (Subtitle: I'll stretch her over a chair, women are merely Gumbys with tits. \n[5]Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast. "}}
