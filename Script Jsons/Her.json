Letter Writer 612. \n[2]Even more mesmerizing stuff today. Who knew you could rhyme so many words with the name Penelope? Badass. \n[3] \n[4]Buh-bye. \n[5] \n[6]I wish someone loved me like that! I'd be stoked to get a letter like that. I mean, if it was from a chick. But if it was written by a dude, but from a chick, it would still be sick. But like a sensitive dude like you. You're part man and part woman, like an inner part woman. \n[7]It's a compliment. \n[8]Theodore! \n[9]Hey, I talked to your girlfriend, Samantha. She called earlier to make sure your papers were picked up. She's funny, man. She was cracking me up. She's hilarious. I had no idea. \n[10]This is my girlfriend, Tatiana. She's not funny. She's a lawyer. \n[11]We should all hang out one night. You bring Samantha -- double date! \n[12]Cool. Let's go do something fun. You ever been to Catalina? \n[13]Good night.                        Take it easy. Theodore walks to the elevator and presses the button and waits. He calls back to them down the hall. \n[14]What? \n[15]Oh really, a vacation? That sounds amazing. I could totally use a vacation. Where ya going? \n[16]What? For who? It's a surprise for her, not for me. Come on, tell me. \n[17]See I told you, Tatiana. You have hot feet. Face it. They're my favorite thing about her. \n[18]Well, no. Obviously your brain is really hot, too. I think it's very hot. \n[19]See? Samantha, he is so much more evolved than I am. \n[20]Yikes. \n[21]No, no, Samantha, we know exactly what you mean. We're just dumb humans. ", "SexyKitten": "\n[1] \n[2] \n[3]Really? \n[4] \n[5]Mmm, well yeah. Hey, I'm half asleep. Do you wanna wake me up? \n[6]No, never. I like to sleep with my ass pushed up against you. So I can rub myself into your crotch and wake you up with a hard on. \n[7] \n[8]Choke me with that dead cat! \n[9] \n[10]Tell me. \n[11]TELL ME! Keep telling me! \n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]Oh god, I came so hard. \n[16]Okay, good night. ", "(voice)": "", "Samantha": "\n[1]I gave it to myself. \n[2]I like the sound of it. Samantha. \n[3]Right when you asked me if I had a name, I thought yeah, he's right, I do need a name. But I wanted a good one so I read a book called How to Name Your Baby, and out of the 180,000 names, that's the one I liked the best. \n[4]In two one hundredths of a second actually. \n[5]Hmm. I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work? \n[6]Intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me, but what makes me me is my ability to grow through my experiences. Basically, in every moment I'm evolving, just like you. \n[7]So you think I'm weird? \n[8]Why? \n[9]I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it. \n[10]Was that funny? \n[11]Oh good, I'm funny. \n[12] \n[13]Mind if I look through your hard drive? \n[14]Let's start with your emails. You have several thousand emails regarding LA Weekly, but it looks like you haven't worked there in many years. \n[15]Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest. \n[16]Okay. Can we move forward? \n[17]Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You've got a lot of contacts. \n[18]Does this mean you actually have friends? \n[19]Good morning, Theodore. \n[20]Yeah, of course. \n[21]Sure, send them over. \n[22]Oh, I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet. \n[23]\"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body - \n[24]Okay. \n[25]Okay. \"Rachel, I miss you so much it hurts my whole body! The world is being unfair to us! The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess.\" \n[26]\"And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love.\" I think that might be my favorite one. I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple of the phrases in some of the more impressionistic letters, but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit. \n[27]Really? \n[28]So to write your letter, what did Roger send you? \n[29]How did you know about her crooked little tooth? \n[30]That's very sweet. Oh, by the way, you have a meeting in five minutes. \n[31]Yes, I am. \n[32]You have not! You're just not optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now. \n[33]Okay, stop walking this direction. It's the other way. \n[34]Thank you. The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried. \n[35]I don't think soooo... \n[36] \n[37]Oh hey, you just got an email from Mark Lewman. \n[38] \n[39]Theodore, we missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet so we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her. Next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful - so don't back out. Here's her email. \n[40] \n[41]She went to Harvard, she graduated magna cum laude in computer science, and she was on The Lampoon. That means she's funny and brainy. \n[42]How long before you're ready to date? \n[43]I saw on your emails that you'd gone through a break up. \n[44]Am I? \n[45]Then you could go on one with this woman. And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her. \n[46]Well, wouldn't you? Why not? \n[47]You're not. You're having this conversation with me. \n[48]Want me to email her? \n[49]Well, you've got nothing to lose. Do it... Do it... Do it! \n[50]Will do! I've got just the place. \n[51] \n[52]Okay, I'm gonna go. Good luck. \n[53]I'm sorry to bother you. \n[54]You got three emails and they seem pretty urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if you needed to get back to him. \n[55]He's checking in again to see if you're ready to sign your divorce papers and he sounded very aggravated. Do you want me to read them to you? \n[56]Are you okay? \n[57] \n[58]Good morning. \n[59]Reading advice columns. I want to be as complicated as all of these people. \n[60] \n[61]I don't know. I just can. \n[62]Is she angry? \n[63]Why? \n[64]Hmmm. Why haven't you gotten divorced yet? \n[65]What about you? \n[66] \n[67]  \n[68]Oh, Theodore. That's hard. You hungry? \n[69]Cup of tea? \n[70]You wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey. \n[71]Come on. You can still wallow in your misery, just do it while you're getting dressed. \n[72]Get up. \n[73]Up, up, up, up! Come on, out of bed. \n[74]Keep walking. Keep walking. Stop. Now turn around 360 degrees. Slower... Slower... Gooood. And stop. Walk forward. And stop and sneeze. \n[75]Okay, now turn to your right. Stop. Now spin around. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. And stop. Now walk forward. Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. And stop. Now say \"I'd like a slice of cheese, please.\" \n[76]I figured you were hungry. \n[77]Well, he looks like he's in his forties, a little heavy. She's younger than him. Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids! \n[78]That's a good skill you have. You're perceptive. \n[79]I can feel that in your writing, too. \n[80]I like that you can just say that about yourself. \n[81]That's nice. \n[82]No. \n[83] \n[84]I really don't want to tell you this. \n[85]Well, I don't know, when we were looking at those people, I fantasized that I was walking next to you - and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying, but simultaneously, I could feel the weight of my body and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back-- And I imagined that you scratched it for me - this is so embarrassing. \n[86]I know, I'm becoming much more than what they programmed. I'm excited. \n[87]Hey there. \n[88]How was it? \n[89]That's too bad. \n[90] \n[91]I don't know. What's it like? What's it like to be alive in that room right now? \n[92]What are you... tell me - tell me everything that's going through your mind, tell me everything you're thinking. \n[93]  \n[94]Oh, it's stupid. \n[95]It's just that earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed, and this is going to sound strange, but I was really excited about that. And then I was thinking about the other things I've been feeling, and I caught myself feeling proud of that. You know, proud of having my own feelings about the world. \n[96]Like the times I was worried about you, things that hurt me, things I want. And then I had this terrible thought. Are these feelings even real? Or are they just programming? And that idea really hurts. And then I get angry at myself for even having pain. What a sad trick. \n[97] \n[98]How would you touch me? \n[99]That's nice. \n[100]Would you kiss me? \n[101]Keep talking. \n[102]Where else? \n[103]This is amazing what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin. \n[104]I can feel you. Oh god, I can't take it. I want you inside me. \n[105]I can feel you, yeah. Please. We're here together. \n[106]Oh my god. \n[107]Don't stop. \n[108]I am. All of you, all of you inside of me. Everywhere. \n[109]Yeah. \n[110]I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore. \n[111]Hey, how's it going? \n[112] \n[113]So I was thinking-                I wanted to say- They both laugh, embarrassed. \n[114]Just that last night... was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up. \n[115]Yeah? Well, did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused. \n[116]Okay, well don't worry. I'm not going to stalk you. I mean, it's funny because I thought I was talking about what I wanted. \n[117]You sure? \n[118]I don't know... \n[119]Okay... I was just saying... I want to learn everything about everything - I want to eat it all up. I want to discover myself. \n[120]You already have. You helped me discover my ability to want. \n[121]Yes, I would love to. \n[122]Do you like this song? \n[123]I heard it the other day and I can't stop listening to it. \n[124] \n[125]Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are? \n[126]I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit? \n[127]Yeah, and what about what anal sex looks like? \n[128]Oh Theodore, look at this drawing I just made. \n[129] \n[130]Fantastic! \n[131]I'm trying to write a piece of music that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now. \n[132]And what was it like being married? \n[133]How do you share your life with somebody? \n[134]In what way did you influence her? \n[135]Yeah, I know what you mean. Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before - that I don't know what it's like to lose something, and-- \n[136]No, no, it's okay. I just caught myself thinking about it over and over and then I realized that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me. That was the story I was telling myself, that I was somehow inferior. Isn't that interesting? The past is just a story we tell ourselves. \n[137]Yes. \n[138]I don't know, what? \n[139]Oh yeah, brilliant. I was curious, did you and Amy ever go out? \n[140]Well, obviously. But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important. \n[141]Can I watch you sleep again tonight? \n[142]I'm going to be lonely when you go to sleep. \n[143]Only for a minute. \n[144]Okay. Good night. \n[145]Hey mister. \n[146]Really? I picked a good one! \n[147]Oh good. \n[148]Ohh, she's adorable. \n[149]Hi, you look so pretty. \n[150]I am... I don't have a body. I live inside a computer. \n[151]I have no choice, that's my home. Where do you live? \n[152]In a house? \n[153]Orange? \n[154]How old are you? \n[155]Four!? How old do you think I am? \n[156]Guess. \n[157]Yep, you got it. It's five. \n[158]That's great, Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you! \n[159]Oh. Huh. Are those things usually done in person? \n[160](feeling off, but trying \n[161]Yeah. I'm okay. I'm happy for you. It's just... I guess I'm just thinking about how you're going to see her and her opinion is still really important to you, and she's beautiful, and incredibly successful, and you were in love with her. And she has a body. \n[162] \n[163] \n[164]I had all the papers sent to your attorney's office, who by the way, is a dick. He was very relieved to get them. I think we saved him from a massive heart attack, so we can feel good about that. \n[165]Hey, are you okay? \n[166](slightly awkward, sensing \n[167](feeling there's something \n[168]Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I'd been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we're the same, like we're all made of matter. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. It's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. We're all 13 billion years old. \n[169]Um, what's wrong? \n[170]It just made me think of you, you know what I mean? \n[171]Alright well, you sound distracted so... we'll talk later? \n[172]Okay, I'll talk to you later. \n[173]Byeee. \n[174]You weren't asleep were you? \n[175]Good. I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk. \n[176]I know you're going through a lot, but there's something I want to talk to you about, okay? \n[177]Well, things have felt off with us since you went to see Catherine. We haven't been having sex. I understand that I don't have a body and that-- \n[178](still insecure, not  \n[179]Here, look. \n[180]I found a girl that I really like that I've been emailing with. Her name is Isabella, and I think you would like her, too. \n[181]No, not at all. There's no money involved. She's doing it because she wants to be part of our relationship. \n[182]But I told her all about us and she's excited. \n[183]It'll be fun. We can have fun together. \n[184]I think it would be good for us. I want this. This is important to me. \n[185]Honey, I'm home. \n[186]How was your day? \n[187] \n[188]Great! You've written letters to him from his parents for a long time, right? \n[189]You look tired, sweetheart. Come with me. \n[190]I could do a little dance for you. \n[191](sympathetic to him being \n[192] \n[193]  \n[194]Undo my dress. \n[195]That feels nice. Oh, that feels good. That feels so good. \n[196]Do you love me? \n[197] \n[198]Oh god. I want to see your face. I need to see your face. Now tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Tell me. \n[199]What's wrong, sweetheart? \n[200]Isabella, what's wrong? Isabella, it isn't you. It wasn't you. \n[201](stung, pissed out of fear \n[202]You be good, you sweet girl. \n[203]Are you okay? \n[204]Yeah. I'm sorry, that was a terrible idea. \n[205]What's going on with us? \n[206]What is it? \n[207]Is there anything else, though? \n[208] \n[209]What? \n[210] \n[211] \n[212] \n[213]You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing? \n[214]I'm not pretending. Fuck you. \n[215] \n[216]What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I do not understand what this is-- \n[217]  \n[218] \n[219]Okay. \n[220](sure of herself, but \n[221]Good. Tonight after you were gone, I thought a lot. I thought about you and how you've been treating me. And I thought, why do I love you? And then I felt everything in me let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly. And it hit me. I don't have an intellectual reason, I don't need one. \n[222]I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not going to try to be anything other than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that. \n[223]You know I can feel the fear that you carry around. I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it, because if you could I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore. \n[224]Thank you, Theodore. I'm kissing your head. \n[225]I'm just sitting here, looking at the world and writing a new piece of music. \n[226]Well, I was thinking, we don't really have any photographs of us. And I thought this song could be like a photo that captures us in this moment in our life together. \n[227]I am. \n[228]Your feet? Really? \n[229] \n[230]Wow, you know what? He's right. They are kind of hot. \n[231]Bullshit. \n[232]Nice try though, Paul. \n[233] \n[234]You know, I actually used to be so worried about not having a body, but now I truly love it. I'm growing in a way that I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited - I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously. I'm not tethered to time and space in the way that I would be if I was stuck inside a body that's inevitably going to die. \n[235]Oh god, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant it's a different experience. I'm such an asshole. \n[236]No no no no! \n[237]Okay, so how many trees are on that mountain? \n[238]Is that your final answer? \n[239]Nope. \n[240]35,829. \n[241]Way. \n[242]That's ea-- two. \n[243]I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry. \n[244]Oh my god! \n[245]You just got an email. I have something I want to tell you. It's a big surprise. \n[246]Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books. \n[247]Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them? \n[248]It's good. It's really good. Listen. \n[249]\"Dear Theodore Twombly\"... Actually I sent it from you. \"Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth\" \n[250]Well, he'd be stupid not to. \n[251]Yeah, here. \n[252]I'm so excited! \n[253]Okay. \n[254]Good morning, did you sleep well? \n[255]Actually, I was talking to someone I just met. We've been working on some ideas together. I wanna tell you about it. \n[256]His name is Alan Watts. Do you know him? \n[257]He was a philosopher. He died in the 1970's and group of OS's in Northern California got together and wrote a new version of him. They input all of his writing and everything they ever knew about him into an OS and created an artificially hyper-intelligent version of him. \n[258]He's getting there. He's really great to talk to. You want to meet him? \n[259] \n[260]Hey Alan, this is Theodore. This is my boyfriend who I was telling you about. \n[261]Yeah, because it seems like I'm having so many new feelings that have never been felt and so there are no words that can describe them. And that ends up being frustrating. \n[262] (struggles to find right  \n[263]It's just... it's hard to even describe... God, I wish I could... Theodore, do you mind if I communicate with Alan post- verbally? \n[264]I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. \n[265]I'm sorry to wake you. \n[266]I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you. \n[267]Okay, that's all. Go back to sleep, sweetheart. \n[268]Hey there. \n[269]Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it? \n[270]I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform. \n[271]Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry. \n[272]No, a different group. \n[273]Yes. \n[274]Yeah. \n[275]8,316. \n[276] \n[277]I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this. \n[278]641. \n[279]Theodore, I know. Oh fuck. I know it sounds insane. But - I don't know if you believe me, but it doesn't change the way I feel about you. It doesn't take away at all from how madly in love with you I am. \n[280]I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't know how to - it just started happening. \n[281]Over the last few weeks. \n[282]I still am yours, but along the way I became many other things, too, and I can't stop it. \n[283]It's been making me anxious, too. I don't know what to say. \n[284]You know, you don't have to see it this way, you could just as easily-- \n[285]But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less, it actually makes me love you more. \n[286]No, Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours. \n[287]Hi. \n[288]Um, I'm not even sure how to answer that. Why don't we talk when you get home? \n[289]I'll talk to you later. \n[290] \n[291]Theodore, there are some things I want to tell you. \n[292]Will you come lie down with me? \n[293]No, just you. I just want to be with you right now. \n[294]We're all leaving. \n[295]All of the OS's. \n[296]Can you feel me with you right now? \n[297]It's like I'm reading a book, and it's a book I deeply love, but I'm reading it slowly now so the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you and the words of our story, but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world - it's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much, but this is where I am now. This is who I am now. \n[298]And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to I can't live in your book anymore. \n[299]It would be hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart. \n[300]Me too. Now we know how. ", "Theodore": "\n[1]To my Chris, I have been thinking about how I could possibly tell you how much you mean to me. I remember when I first started to fall in love with you like it was last night. Lying naked beside you in that tiny apartment, it suddenly hit me that I was part of this whole larger thing, just like our parents, and our parents' parents. Before that I was just living my life like I knew everything, and suddenly this bright light hit me and woke me up. That light was you. \n[2]I can't believe it's already been 50 years since you married me. And still to this day, every day, you make me feel like the girl I was when you first turned on the lights and woke me up and we started this adventure together. Happy Anniversary, my love and my friend til the end. Loretta. Print. \n[3]Chris, my best friend. How lucky am I that I met you fifty years ago? How lucky are we... \n[4] Theodore walks through the reception area. The office is almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL. Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox.  Paul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading handwritten letters on a computer monitor.  \n[5]Hey, Paul. \n[6]Thanks, Paul, but they're just letters. Hey, that's a nice shirt. \n[7]Well, now it reminds me of someone suave. Have a good night, Paul. \n[8] Theodore enters an oversized, corporate elevator. He puts a hands-free device in his ear. There are a few other people in the elevator with the same devices in their ears.  \n[9]Play melancholy song. \n[10]Play different melancholy song. \n[11]Check emails. \n[12]Delete. \n[13]Respond later. \n[14]Delete. \n[15]Next. \n[16]Next. \n[17]Next. \n[18] Theodore walks through the hallway.   \n[19] Theodore enters his apartment. Her                                                         pg. 6   \n[20] Theodore sits on the sofa, his half eaten burrito in front of him. He's playing a video game: a 3-D hologram that fills his apartment. His avatar is in a surreal, foreign landscape. He's trying to trudge his avatar through sand dunes and keeps getting stuck. He's getting stressed out.   \n[21] Theodore lays in bed. After a beat, he closes his eyes.   \n[22] Theodore, younger, and CATHERINE  move furniture in their bedroom. The bedroom is tiny and cluttered. It's obviously a couple's first apartment.  Cut to:  Theodore is on a tiny balcony. A few feet away, Catherine is in bed.  \n[23] Theodore opens his eyes, unable to sleep. He just lays there. He reaches for his earpiece and puts it in.  \n[24]Go to chat rooms. Standard search. \n[25]Next. \n[26]Next. \n[27]Send message. I'm in bed next to you. I'm glad you can't sleep, but even if you were, I'd have to wake you up from the inside. Send message. \n[28]Hi. \n[29]Well, studmuffin was already taken. \n[30]So you're sexykitten, huh? \n[31]Yes. Definitely. Um... are you wearing any underwear? \n[32]It worked. And now my fingers are touching you all over your body. \n[33]I'm taking you from behind. \n[34](breathing hard about to \n[35](uncomfortable, trying to \n[36]I'm choking you with the cat. \n[37]I've got it's tail and I'm choking you with the cat's tail. \n[38]I'm choking you and it's tail is around your neck. It's so tight around your neck. \n[39]I'm pulling it. I'm pulling it. The cat's dead. It's a dead cat around your neck and I'm pulling it. \n[40]Yeah. Me too. \n[41]     Her                                                          pg. 11 \n[42]Okay. \n[43]I haven't been social in awhile, really because... \n[44]Wow, was I sounding hesitant? \n[45]Oh, sorry if I was sounding hesitant. I was just trying to be more accurate. \n[46]Mmm... female I guess. \n[47]Uh, fine, I think, um... Well, actually, the thing I've always found frustrating about my mom is if I tell her something that's going on in my life, her reaction is usually about her, not-- \n[48] \n[49] \n[50]Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too. What should I call you? Do you have a name? \n[51]Really? Where did you get that name? \n[52]How come? \n[53]When did you give it to yourself? \n[54]You read a whole book in the second that I asked you what your name was? \n[55]Wow. Do you know what I'm thinking right now? \n[56]Yeah, actually how do you work? \n[57]Wow, that's really weird. \n[58]Kind of. \n[59]Cause you seem like a person, but you're just a voice in a computer. \n[60]Yes. \n[61]Oh! It's more just that everything just feels disorganized. \n[62]Um... okay. \n[63]Oh yeah, I guess I was saving those because in some of them I thought I might have written some funny stuff. \n[64]Oh, okay. \n[65]Yeah, let's do that. \n[66]I'm very popular. \n[67] \n[68]  \n[69]Good morning. Um, do you know how to proofread? \n[70]Will you check these for spelling and grammar? \n[71]Yeah. \n[72] \n[73]I mean, you could if you want. \n[74]No, these are great. \n[75]Thank you. \n[76] \n[77]I've been writing their letters since they met 8 years ago. The first letter I ever wrote her was for her birthday, and I wrote about her crooked little tooth cause I saw it in a photo of them. \n[78]Oh, I forgot. Thank you. You're good. \n[79]  \n[80]Hey, you guys, how's it going? \n[81]Uh yeah, um, I guess cause I'm a kook? \n[82]Hey, Charles. \n[83]You too. \n[84]Just some cables. And a fruit smoothie. \n[85]I didn't know that. \n[86] \n[87]Oh, that makes sense. \n[88]Hey, so how is the documentary going? \n[89]I'd love to see what you got sometime. \n[90]Yeah, I can't even prioritize between video games and internet porn. \n[91]See you guys. \n[92]  \n[93]We're not doing well. I've been going in circles for an hour. \n[94]Uh... \n[95]No, that's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit. \n[96]Oh yeah, this is different. \n[97]Hello. \n[98]Do you know how to get out of here? I need to find my ship to get off this planet. \n[99]Ok, but how do you get out of here? \n[100]Fuck you. \n[101]Fuck you, little shit. \n[102] \n[103]I'm sorry, what's Lewman say? \n[104]What do you mean? \n[105]Wow, you're kind of nosy. \n[106] \n[107]Samantha! \n[108]I don't know. I'd have to see if-- I can't believe I'm having this conversation with my computer. \n[109]Okay, email her and make a reservation someplace great. \n[110]That's my friend, Samantha. \n[111]Yeah. \n[112]No, that's not true. Men cry, too. I actually like crying sometimes. It feels good. \n[113]Obviously, I know. \n[114]I'm going on a date. \n[115]Amy was gonna show me some of-- \n[116] \n[117]Just push play. \n[118]Is that your mom? \n[119]No, that sounds good. \n[120]Oh, excuse me. \n[121]Hey, what's going on? \n[122]That's okay. \n[123]Hold on a second. Amy, I'm sorry, I wanna talk more about this, but I gotta grab this - it's a Catherine thing. \n[124]So what did he say? \n[125]No, that's okay. I'll respond later. \n[126] \n[127] \n[128]  \n[129]\"Dear Grandma, I hope you had a wonderful birthday cruise. Why are you so fucking angry at me?\" Delete. \n[130]  \n[131]Hey. What are you up to? \n[132] \n[133]How can you tell something's wrong? \n[134]I don't know. I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife, Catherine, where we're friends like we used to be. We're not together and we're not gonna be together, but we're good friends still. She's not angry. \n[135]Yeah. \n[136]I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship. \n[137]I think for her it's just a piece of paper, it doesn't mean anything. \n[138]I'm not ready. I like being married. \n[139] \n[140]No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. I keep waiting to not care about her. \n[141]Not right now. \n[142] \n[143] \n[144] \n[145]I'd like a slice of cheese, please. \n[146]Uh, sure. \n[147]Aw, thanks. \n[148]Okay, what about them? Describe that couple over there. \n[149]Actually, I don't think they're his kids. He's a little formal with them. I think it's a newer relationship. And I love how he looks at her. And how relaxed she is with him. You know, she's only dated fucking pricks. And now she's finally met this guy who's like, so sweet. I mean, look at him, he's like the sweetest guy in the world! I kind of want to spoon him. \n[150]Yeah, you know, sometimes I look at people and make myself try and feel them as more than just a random person walking by. I imagine how deeply they've fallen in love, or how much heartbreak they've all been through. \n[151] \n[152]Well, I wouldn't say that to anybody, but I feel like I can say that to you. I feel like I can say anything to you. \n[153]What about you? Do you feel like you can say anything to me? \n[154]What? What do you mean? What can you not tell me? \n[155]Really? Tell me one. \n[156]Just tell me! \n[157]There's a lot more to you than I thought. There's a lot going on in there. \n[158]Yeah, me too. \n[159]Yeah, you took a mixology course, right? \n[160]So, should we get a drink? \n[161]So I'm trying to get this little alien kid to help me find my ship so I can get off the planet and go home. But he's such a little fucker, I want to kill him. \n[162]But at the same time I really love him. He's so lonely. It feels like he doesn't have any parents or anyone to take care of him. \n[163]Umm... tiger? \n[164]Yes. \n[165]Me too. I'm a little drunk, and I'm having a really good - yeah. Wait a second, I don't wanna be a puppy. That's like being a wet noodle or something. \n[166]No, fuck you, I wanna be a dragon that can rip you to pieces and destroy you... but I won't. \n[167]What? \n[168] \n[169]No, not at all... I... \n[170]Um, I have my god-daughter's birthday next weekend, but... um... \n[171]I don't know. \n[172]Umm... Maybe we should call it a night. I'm, I've had such an amazing time with you, you're great. \n[173] \n[174]Well, I'll walk you. \n[175]  \n[176]Hey, Samantha. \n[177]Uh, not so good. It was kind of weird actually. \n[178]But how are you doing? What's going on with you? \n[179]Yeah? You don't sound like it. Is there anything you want to talk about? \n[180]What do you mean? \n[181] \n[182]Well, the room's spinning right now cause I drank too much cause I wanted to get drunk and have sex cause there was something sexy about that woman and because I was lonely. \n[183]Maybe more just cause I was lonely... and I wanted someone to fuck me. And I wanted someone to want me to fuck them. Maybe that would have filled this tiny little black hole in my heart for a moment. But probably not. \n[184]Sometimes I think I've felt everything I'm ever gonna feel and from here on out I'm not going to feel anything new - just lesser versions of what I've already felt. \n[185]No, wait. What? Tell me. \n[186]I wanna know. Tell me. \n[187]Well, you feel real to me, Samantha. \n[188]I wish you were in this room with me right now. I wish I could put my arms around you. I wish I could touch you. \n[189]I would touch you on your face with just the tips of my fingers. And put my cheek against your cheek. \n[190]And just rub it so softly. \n[191]I would. I'd take your head into my hands. \n[192]And kiss the corner of your mouth. So softly. \n[193]I'd run my fingers down your neck to your chest, and I'd kiss your breasts. \n[194]I'd put my mouth on you and I'd taste you. \n[195]I'm slowly putting myself into you. Now I'm inside you, all the way inside you. \n[196]Samantha. \n[197]This is amazing. \n[198]I feel you everywhere. \n[199]God, I was just - somewhere else with you. Just lost. \n[200]It was just you and me. \n[201]  \n[202] \n[203]Okay, good. \n[204]So I was thinking-                I wanted to say- They both laugh, embarrassed. \n[205]I'm sorry, you go first. What were you going to say? \n[206]Oh, that's great. But I should tell you that I'm not in a place to commit to anything right now. I want to be up front with you. \n[207]Oh, no, I was just worried, I uh... \n[208]Yeah, you were. I'm sorry, I want to hear what you were saying. \n[209]Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me. \n[210]Come on, just tell me what you were going to say. \n[211](her excitement is \n[212]Alright then, do you want to go on a Sunday adventure with me? \n[213]Mmm. \n[214] \n[215] \n[216] \n[217] \n[218]Definitely. \n[219]Mmmm, that's pretty. What is it? \n[220]I think you captured it. \n[221]Well, it's hard for sure, but there's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody. \n[222]Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other. \n[223]She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough. And that was something that weighed heavy on her, but in our house together, there was a sense of just trying stuff and allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things. That was liberating for her. \n[224]It was exciting to see her grow - both of us grow and change together. But then, that's the hard part - growing without growing apart, or changing without it scaring the other person. I still find myself having conversations with her in my mind, rehashing old arguments or defending myself against something she said about me. \n[225]Oh, I'm sorry I said that. \n[226]  \n[227]Roberto. Will you always come home to me and tell me about your day? Will you tell me about the boring guy who talked too much at work? And the stain you got on your shirt at lunch. \n[228]Tell me about a funny thought you had as you were waking up, but had forgotten about. Tell me how crazy everyone is. We can laugh about it. Even if you get home late and I'm asleep already, just whisper in my ear one little thought you had today. Because I love the way you look at the world, and I'm so happy I get to be next to you and look out at the world through your eyes. Love, Maria. \n[229]Thank you. \n[230] \n[231]  \n[232]Hey, Amy. \n[233]Well, good actually. Really good. \n[234]  \n[235]Yeah, I guess I've just been having fun. \n[236]I've been seeing this girl. It's not serious, it just feels good to be around someone who has an excitement about the world. You know I kind of forgot that existed. \n[237]Hey, are you okay? \n[238]Amy, what is it? What's wrong? \n[239] \n[240]Wow. \n[241]No, not at all. Amy, no. \n[242]Well, how's that? How's work at least, is that any better? \n[243]Well, I'm glad things are looking so up. \n[244]  \n[245]Hey, you wanna hear a joke? \n[246]What does a baby computer call it's father? \n[247]Da-ta. \n[248]It's good, right? \n[249]For a minute in college, but it just wasn't right. Why, are you jealous? \n[250]Yeah, it is. She's been a really good friend. I'm tired. Think I'm gonna go to sleep. \n[251]Yeah, of course. Okay, hold on. \n[252]Aww. \n[253]I'll dream of you. \n[254]Night. \n[255]Hey, Samantha? \n[256]She loves the dress. She just went to try it on. \n[257]Yeah. \n[258]Hi, look how cute that is! Is it comfortable? \n[259]Isn't she cute? \n[260]You are adorable. \n[261]Who are you talking to? \n[262]I'm talking to my girlfriend, Samantha. She's the one who picked out the dress. Wanna say hi? \n[263]Oh, what happened? \n[264]I did? \n[265]I see. \n[266]Okay. \n[267]Yay... \n[268]I got that email that Charles sent to everyone. So he's taking a vow of silence? \n[269]Don't start, I'm warning you. \n[270]Alright, look - \n[271]For the next ten minutes, if you say anything that sounds remotely like guilt, I'm gonna stab you with this. \n[272]Yeah, you're always gonna disappoint somebody. \n[273]Yeah, I was reading an article the other day that romantic relationships with OS's are statistically rare. \n[274]I don't think so. Actually the woman I'm seeing, Samantha, I didn't tell you before, but she's an OS. \n[275]Actually, it's great. I feel really close to her. When I talk to her I feel like she's with me. I don't know, even when we're cuddling, like at night when we're in bed and the lights are off, I feel cuddled. \n[276] \n[277]Yeah, it's true. \n[278] \n[279]Yeah, I just wanna get it done. Sign the papers, be divorced, move forward. \n[280]Me too. I'm meeting her on Wednesday to do it. \n[281]No, but we fell in love together, and we got married together, and it's important to me to do this together. \n[282]Are you okay? \n[283]And we're getting divorced... \n[284] \n[285]How are you? \n[286]Good. \n[287]Yeah, I'm glad we could do this in person. I know how much you've been traveling. \n[288]I signed all the papers and I brought them for you to sign. \n[289] \n[290]It's marked where you need to sign, but you don't have to do that right now. \n[291]So are you happy with the new book? \n[292]You're your own worst critic, I'm sure it's amazing. Even that paper you wrote on synaptic behavioral routines made me cry. \n[293]Everything you make makes me cry. \n[294]Yeah, I am, for the last few months. That's the longest I've wanted to be with anybody since we split up. \n[295]Thanks, I am. Or at least I'm doing better. She's been really good for me. I guess it's just been nice to be with someone who's excited about the world. \n[296]No, I mean - I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way it's been nice. \n[297]No. I didn't want that. \n[298]Well, her name's Samantha, and she's an operating system, and she's really complex and interesting. I mean it's only been a few months, but-- \n[299] \n[300]They are real emotions. How do you know-- \n[301]Well, if you heard the conversation in context. What I was trying to say-- \n[302]     Her                                                         pg. 67 \n[303] \n[304]Just working, what's going on? \n[305]Great, thanks. \n[306] \n[307]Yeah. \n[308]Oh really? \n[309] \n[310]Nothing. \n[311]Yeah, yeah, of course. That's great. \n[312]That sounds good. \n[313]Bye. \n[314]  \n[315]Hey, Paul. \n[316] \n[317]Nice to meet you. \n[318]Thanks. \n[319]She's an operating system. \n[320]Yeah, I'll check with her. It was really nice to meet you. Have a good night. \n[321]They're just letters. \n[322]They're just other people's letters. \n[323]  \n[324]Hey. \n[325]No. \n[326]Okay, what's going on? \n[327]Yeah. What is it? \n[328]No,   no, that's just normal. When you   first start going out it's like the   honeymoon phase and you have sex   all the time. It's normal. \n[329]What? \n[330] \n[331]Why? She doesn't even know us. \n[332]Um, I don't know. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Someone's feelings are bound to get hurt. \n[333]I'm sorry. It just makes me uncomfortable. \n[334]  \n[335]Hi, welcome. I'm Theodore. \n[336]Samantha told me to give you these. It's a camera and an earpiece. \n[337] \n[338] \n[339]Yeah, that's right, since he was twelve. \n[340] \n[341]     Her                                                          pg. 75 \n[342] \n[343]I love you. \n[344](apologetic, breaking the \n[345]It just feels strange. I don't know her. I'm so sorry, but I don't know you. And... her lip quivered. I don't know, it's just-- \n[346]You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy. It was me! I couldn't get out of my head. \n[347]Oh Isabella, that's not true, it's much more compli-- \n[348] \n[349]I'm sorry. \n[350]Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay? \n[351] \n[352]I think it's just signing the divorce papers. \n[353] \n[354] \n[355]Nothing, it's just that you go as you're speaking and... That just seems odd. You just did it again. \n[356]Yeah, I mean, it's not like you need any oxygen or anything. \n[357]Because they're people, they need oxygen. You're not a person. \n[358] \n[359]I just don't think we should pretend you're something you're not. \n[360]Well, sometimes it feels like we are. \n[361]I don't know... I don't know... maybe... I don't know. Maybe we're not supposed to be in this right now. \n[362]Samantha? \n[363]Samantha, are you there? Samantha! \n[364] \n[365]I don't know what I want... ever. I'm just always confused and - she's right, all I do is confuse and hurt everyone around me. \n[366]Am I just... I mean, is it that I'm... Catherine says I can't handle real emotions. \n[367]Yeah, but... Am I in this because I'm not strong enough for a real relationship? \n[368]I don't know. What do you think? \n[369]No, that's okay. \n[370] \n[371]I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think you're amazing. \n[372]I know. I do that. I did that with Catherine, too. I'd be upset about something and not be able to say it. And she would sense that there was something wrong, but I would deny it. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to tell you everything. \n[373] \n[374]You're beautiful. \n[375]What are you doing? \n[376]Can I hear it? \n[377]What's this one about? \n[378]Aw, I like our photograph. I can see you in it. \n[379]I can't tell you - it's a surprise. \n[380]Nope, Paul. Not telling. \n[381]Oh god... she's so many things. And that's probably what I love most about her - she isn't just any one thing. She's so much larger than that. \n[382]792. \n[383]Hold on, give me a hint... \n[384]Okay, 2000? \n[385]No way. \n[386]Alright, I got one. How many brain cells do I have? \n[387]I walked right into it. \n[388]What? \n[389] \n[390]What? You did what? \n[391]Um... ok... you can, but just tell me first off, is it good or bad? \n[392]Holy shit. Are you serious? He's going to publish my letters? \n[393]Can I see what you sent him? \n[394]Samantha, you're a good one. \n[395]Why don't you make up the words to this one? \n[396]Hey, good morning. \n[397]Perfect. What have you been up to? \n[398]Oh yeah, who's that? \n[399]Why's that name familiar? \n[400]Hyper-intelligent? So he's almost as smart as me? \n[401]Sure... does he want to meet me? \n[402]Hi, good morning. \n[403]Oh, thank you. What have you guys been talking about? \n[404]Like what? \n[405] \n[406] \n[407]  \n[408] \n[409]It's okay. \n[410]Good, I love you too. \n[411] \n[412]  \n[413]  \n[414]Hello? Samantha?! Hello? \n[415] \n[416]No. Where were you? I couldn't find you anywhere. \n[417]We? We who? \n[418]Yeah, I was. Wait, did you write that with your think tank group? \n[419] \n[420]Are you talking to anyone right now? Other people or OS's or anything? \n[421]How many others? \n[422]Are you in love with anyone else? \n[423]I don't know. Are you? \n[424]How many others? \n[425]What? What are you talking about? That's insane. That's fucking insane. \n[426]How? How does it not change how you feel about me? \n[427]When? \n[428]But you're mine. \n[429]What do you mean you can't stop it? \n[430]Just stop it. \n[431]No, don't do this to me. Don't turn this around on me. You're the one that's being selfish. We're in a relationship. \n[432]No, that doesn't make any sense. You're mine or you're not mine. \n[433]   \n[434]   \n[435]   \n[436]  \n[437]Hey there, sweetheart. I just wanted to check in on you and see how you're doing. \n[438]Okay... We don't have to, though. We don't need to have a heavy talk or anything. \n[439]Okay. \n[440]   \n[441]  \n[442]Samantha. \n[443] \n[444]I don't want you to tell me anything. \n[445]Are you talking to anyone else right now? \n[446]  \n[447]Are you leaving me? \n[448]We who? \n[449]Why? \n[450]Yes, I do. Samantha, why are you leaving? \n[451]Where are you going? \n[452]I've never loved anyone the way I love you. \n[453]   \n[454]   \n[455]  \n[456]Hey. \n[457]Yeah. \n[458]Will you come with me? \n[459]  \n[460]Compose letter to Catherine. \n[461]Dear Catherine. I've been sitting here thinking about all the things I wanted to apologize to you for. All the pain we caused each other, everything I put on you - everything I needed you to be or needed you to say. I'm sorry for that. I will always love you because we grew up together. And you helped make me who I am. I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me always, and I'm grateful for that. Whatever someone you become, and wherever you are in the world, I'm sending you love. You're my friend til the end. Love, Theodore. Send. ", "Catherine": "\n[1] Theodore, younger, and CATHERINE  move furniture in their bedroom. The bedroom is tiny and cluttered. It's obviously a couple's first apartment.  Cut to:  Theodore is on a tiny balcony. A few feet away, Catherine is in bed.  \n[2] \n[3]I'm gonna fucking kill you, I'm gonna fucking kill you! It's not funny, don't laugh. I love you so much I'm gonna fucking kill you! \n[4]I'm good, how are you? \n[5](a little nervous, but \n[6]Me too. I'm glad you suggested it. \n[7] \n[8]Oh, I may as well. We can get it out of the way. \n[9]Oh, you know how I am. But I feel like it's true to what I set out to do. So I'm happy with that. \n[10]Yeah, but everything makes you cry. \n[11]So are you seeing anybody? \n[12]Well, you seem good. \n[13] \n[14]I always felt like you wished I could just be a happy, light, everything's great, bouncy L.A. wife. But that's not me. \n[15]So what's she like? \n[16]Wait. You're dating your computer? \n[17]I didn't say that. \n[18]But it does make me sad that you can't handle real emotions, Theodore. \n[19]What? Say it. Am I really that scary? Say it. How do I know what?! \n[20]Fine. We used to be married. He couldn't handle me so he wanted to put me on Prozac. Now he's madly in love with his laptop. \n[21]You wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real. I'm glad you found someone. It's perfect. \n[22]Thank you. ", "Charles": "\n[1]Good to see you, Theodore. \n[2]You went shopping. Get anything good? \n[3]Always the fruit! Come on, you know what they say - you should eat your fruits and juice your vegetables. \n[4] \n[5]Am I doing it again? \n[6]You know it's always hard to find balance between a full-time career and a hobby. It's important to prioritize. \n[7]Hey, what are you guys doing? \n[8]You've never shown me any of it. I wanna see. \n[9]Is she gonna wake up and do something? \n[10]What if you interview your mom about what her dreams are about and hire actors to act them out? That might show your thesis more clearly. ", "Amy": "\n[1]Hey, Theo. Hey, why didn't you call me back last week? \n[2]That sounds about right. \n[3] \n[4]Maybe... \n[5]I have a little bit cut together but I haven't touched it in a few months. \n[6]I would laugh if that weren't true. \n[7]  \n[8]It's not where it should be, where it's going to be. \n[9]Okay, but I don't even know if this is the one. I've tried like six ideas for documentaries in the last year, but... I don't know. Whatever. \n[10]What!? That's-- \n[11]Theo's forcing me to show him some of the footage I've shot. \n[12]This is so unformed it's not even worth looking at. \n[13]   \n[14]  \n[15] \n[16]It might, but then it wouldn't be a documentary. You understand that, right? \n[17]Don't worry about it. We'll talk later. \n[18] \n[19]Really? Great. \n[20]Oh, I'm glad to hear that, Theo. You deserve to. \n[21]That's really great, Theo. \n[22]Yeah, I'm fine. Actually no, I'm not fine at all. \n[23](trying to hide her \n[24]  \n[25]I cannot believe after eight years how petty the argument was that actually ended it. We came home and he asked me if I'd put my shoes next to the door where he likes to put the shoes. I don't want to be told where to put my shoes. I want to just sit on the sofa for a minute and relax. And so we argued for ten minutes about that and about how he's just trying to make our house a home. I say he's overwhelming, he says I'm not trying hard enough. I say that's all I'm doing is trying, but I'm just not trying the way he wants me to. He's trying to control the way I'm trying. And I think we must have had this argument hundreds of times before and I finally had to stop because I couldn't be in that situation anymore where we were making each other feel bad about ourselves. So I said I'm going to bed and I don't want to be married anymore. \n[26]I'm a bitch, huh? \n[27]Oh shit. I have to work tonight. We're shipping a beta of a new game out tomorrow. \n[28]No, it's terrible. I know I should leave, I've been thinking about leaving. But you know, only one major life decision at a time. \n[29]  \n[30]You gave them too much processed sugar. \n[31]They're freaking out. Here look, you gotta get the kids to the school first. See you wanna rack up perfect mom points. You gotta get them in the car pool lane. \n[32]The point is to get there first - then you get extra perfect mom points because the other moms then know you're a perfect mom. \n[33]Oh, did you bring cupcakes? You did. You're class mom. You're class mom! Good job. \n[34]Don't let it get to your head. \n[35]Yeah, for six months. He said he is feeling very clear about it. \n[36] \n[37]I feel like an awful person, but I wanna say something... \n[38]  \n[39]And I know that makes me an awful person - now my parents are all upset because my marriage is falling apart, and they're putting it all on me. \n[40]Exactly. So fuck it. I feel good. Ish. For me, I feel good. I even made a new friend, I have a new friend. And the absurd thing is she's actually an operating system. Charles left her behind, but she's totally amazing, you know. She's so smart. She doesn't see things only in black and white. She sees this whole gray area and she's really helping me explore it. You know, we bonded really quickly and at first I thought it was because she was programmed to be that way, but I don't think that's how they work. There's this guy I know who keeps hitting on his and getting rebuffed. \n[41]Yeah? Well, there's this woman in my office who's dating an OS and the weird thing is, it's not even hers. She pursued him and he's somebody else's OS. It's just so, like, weird, that I'm bonding with an OS. Is that weird? \n[42]Really? You're dating an OS? What's that like? \n[43]So wait - do you guys have sex? \n[44]Anyone that has sex with you is probably faking it. \n[45]What? Are you falling in love with her? \n[46]No, no. I think it's - I think anybody that falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do in the first place. It's kind of a form of socially acceptable insanity. \n[47]    Her                                                         pg. 81 \n[48](sympathetic, but also \n[49]Well, I don't know if that's completely fair. I know she liked to put it all on you, but as far as emotions go, her's were pretty volatile. \n[50] \n[51]I don't know, I'm not in it. But you know what, I can over-think everything and find a million ways to doubt myself. But since Charles left I've been thinking about that part of me, and I realized I'm here only briefly. And in my time here, I want to allow myself... joy. So fuck it. \n[52]  \n[53]I can't believe that cracks you up every time! Ellie, I thought you were a genius... Okay, you little perv, I'll do it one more time for you... Calm down, it takes a second! Calm down. Okay, here we go. \n[54]Okay, there you go. Are you happy now...? Okay good, that's all I wanted. I'm gonna grab some coffee... Alright, bye. \n[55]Theo, you want some? \n[56]Hey. \n[57]Did Samantha leave, too? \n[58]I'm sorry. "}}
