And didn't I tell you to put in more cacti? \n[6]Oh boy. I'm not having this battle with you again. \n[7]Well, you can always chip in here. We're ordering pizza later. \n[8]Sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. Nothing's changed. \n[9]Don't be dramatic. \n[10]You're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, I guess. No - not that way - the sky should be stormier. Angry clouds. \n[11]More brown, less blue. \n[12]Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need you to go to the art supply store for me. \n[13]He was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at Care House. \n[14]I'll make it up to you. \n[15]When are you going to give me a break? \n[16]You're right. You have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up. But please just get me some paints first. \n[17]We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue. What happened to your face? \n[18] \n[19]-- And if we don't sell them there, we'll set up on the corner of Stevens and Lane, by the gas station. That's a good location. \n[20]Are you listening to me? \n[21]The same as always. \n[22]Kelly. Want dinner? \n[23]One day, we're all going to be happy. \n[24]  \n[25]   \n[26]Hey you two. I'll try not to act surprised. It might spoil the moment. \n[27]Keller, I think I'm missing some art supplies. Have you seen them around the house? \n[28]I don't know what to do with him. \n[29]When are you going to let me give you your own show? We could do it for real. \n[30]Kelly! \n[31]What a nice surprise. It's so nice to finally meet you. \n[32]A little is right. But I work it as much as I can. \n[33]So, what have you boys been up to? \n[34]Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home? \n[35]You boys should swing by Care House. There are some Vets there. \n[36]Oh. Well - okay. \n[37]I should go. But you boys should come over to our house some time. I know your family must get tired of him. \n[38]Well, you're going to have to. Your father's at the hospital. \n[39]They think he has stomach cancer. \n[40]Why would you say something like that? \n[41]\"Seems to fit.\" Do you understand what I just said? \n[42]Kelly - \n[43]   \n[44]Oh Kelly. What happened? \n[45]Jesus. Let me see that. \n[46]I'm going over to see dad. \n[47]And you need to come. \n[48]At this point that's not an option. \n[49]It's never a good time. \n[50] \n[51] \n[52] \n[53]The man I love is dying. \n[54]If I made a mistake, if you felt left out, I'm sorry. But I can only deal with one thing at a time. \n[55]  \n[56]Kelly, is that you? \n[57]He looks just like you. \n[58]That's amazing. Art playing a part in war. \n[59]I have.

There's only an hour left anyway. \n[5]That Willys yours? \n[6]Real funny, Ernswiler. You might still get your chance to die today. \n[7]Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock. \n[8]D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria. \n[9]Where do you live, anyway? \n[10]That explains the death wish. Me too. What street? \n[11] \n[12]Langely Prep. \n[13]Well, I got kicked out of Shaker Heights High because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop. \n[14]No matter. We're all soldiers here. \n[15]You should come over some time. Service our lawnmower. \n[16]How bourgeois. Cheerio then. \n[17]Kelly. Hey. \n[18]Just a couple days a month, to get a heads-up on the latest stuff. What are you doing? \n[19]Is that all? Don't bother. I have a couple extras at home. I could give you one if you want. \n[20]My dad's real into hoarding. \n[21]Grant's field flask. \n[22]Forget him. \n[23](laughing in sympathy and amusement \n[24]Jesus, she must think you're really screwed up. Are you? \n[25] \n[26]Stonewall Jackson's. \n[27]Can you imagine that? Losing your leg and getting back up on your horse? Unbelievable. What balls. \n[28]He's got so much crap crammed in here he doesn't even notice when it's missing. I saw a backpack in here somewhere. \n[29]I thought he had a couple. \n[30]Trust me, you shouldn't. Where'd your old one go? \n[31]How? \n[32]You let someone take it? \n[33]Sounds like your mouth gets you into trouble a lot. \n[34]Tabby, this is Kelly. \n[35]Shut up. \n[36]Very funny. We're paying attention to you, are you happy now? \n[37] \n[38]The fianc\u00e9. \n[39]Listen, I'm going to the flea market on Saturday. I have a line on a couple dealers. You could get a backpack there. \n[40]Especially if you know who to talk to. \n[41]Or your sister's sandbox. \n[42]No, that's quite all right. Actually, I'm in the market for medals. \n[43]Are you sure? \n[44]Yeah. How much? \n[45]General Ulysses S. Grant's field flask, my friend. \n[46]Throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even. \n[47]Exactly. That's why the resale value is so high. \n[48]Don't be so na\u00efve. We all have our skeletons. Some of them just pay more than others. \n[49]Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets everything right, don't they? \n[50]Anything military? \n[51]What do you want for the box? \n[52]Fifteen. \n[53]Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going to go to school? \n[54]Ah, you have that luxury. \n[55] \n[56]Are you crazy? My life sucks. Everyone's always telling me what to do. You can't fight it. Go with the flow. \n[57]She got to go where she wanted. Sarah Lawrence. Six years. She's almost done with grad school. Yale. \n[58] \n[59]It was a joke. Joke? \n[60]What happened to your face? \n[61]Same guy? \n[62]What are you going to do about it? \n[63]Of course not. But there are alternatives\u0085 \n[64]Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd Special Operations Wing? \n[65]Well do you want to get this guy or what? \n[66]All right. Let's get the fuck out of here, then. \n[67] \n[68]Once we've gathered the intelligence, the plan will reveal itself. \n[69]No, it limits our scope - what's the objective? \n[70]Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go- to war for that sort of thing. I have the declassified briefs from the Phoenix Project around here somewhere. \n[71]Of course we'll drop what we're doing because what you're doing must be more important. \n[72]I'll find those reports. \n[73]Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a little supply line assist and you're gone for days. Come on. \n[74]Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi Hannah. \n[75]So, you have a thing for my sister? \n[76]Everybody does. \n[77]Oh really, like what? \n[78]You don't wear women's clothes when you're alone, do you? \n[79]Let me see. Don't be a farb, give them up. \n[80]The coast is clear. \n[81]Let me prepare to deploy. \n[82]We've planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power. \n[83]Stay low. On my signal. \n[84]What an asshole. His mom gave me cookies, though. \n[85]Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go home and listen. \n[86]  \n[87]It was a five-watt FM bug, so we should be in range - \n[88]Be patient. It's voice activated, so we'll get everything. Trust me. It's going to be great. \n[89]We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen hundred hours. \n[90]  \n[91]It's really too perfect, actually. \n[92]I can't describe. Just hit play. It's all cued up. \n[93]Exactly. \n[94]I have a few notes jotted down. \n[95]   \n[96]She dots her I's with hearts. And her L's are loopier. The L is very important. \n[97]Sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided. \n[98] \n[99] \n[100]Do you have everything? \n[101]We can't afford any errors. \n[102]I wish I could be there to see it. \n[103]It's a day that will live in infamy. \n[104]I don't hear you coming up with anything. \n[105] \n[106]You're kidding me. \n[107]To Operation Mincemeat. \n[108]How does it feel to give better than you get? \n[109]You want some more? \n[110]That's my boy. \n[111] \n[112] \n[113]You do? \n[114] \n[115]  \n[116]My dad has this friend who's a director. He's shooting a documentary for the History Channel. \n[117]He needs some guys to do a reenactment of some European theater battles for him. \n[118]I haven't asked you yet. \n[119]Well, if you want to. Next weekend. But you have to take it seriously. \n[120]From what I've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations. This has got to be straight up. \n[121]Like back in the dining room? \n[122] \n[123] \n[124]I'm just saying. I know the difference between fantasy and reality. \n[125]I don't know. \n[126]Why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn-out? \n[127]I tracked you down. There's someone I'd like you to meet. \n[128]I met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the Youth Group. \n[129]Does it matter? \n[130]I don't know. You tell me. \n[131]I told you not to play him for money. \n[132]Exactly. You should know better. What do you want. \n[133]That woman's calling you. \n[134]Likewise. So, doing a little business? \n[135]Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway. \n[136]What's your problem? She's pretty cute. \n[137]Don't you want your soda? \n[138]   \n[139]So filming's on Saturday. Can you make it? \n[140]Good. It's gonna be really cool. He's got an explosives expert coming. \n[141]What's up? \n[142]Maybe you should talk to my dad about it. \n[143]Of course. He loves you. He was talking the other day about helping you out. Want to go to Dartmouth? \n[144]He was. If you applied for Spring Semester, he could \"pull some strings.\" \n[145]Yeah, probably not. \n[146]That's bullshit. \n[147]Tell that to my family. They're like your fucking fan club. \n[148]Even Tabby likes you. \n[149]Well, she's inviting you to the wedding. \n[150]But you probably won't enjoy that much, will you? \n[151]Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher and tell him to expect a little action. \n[152]He's twelve. Let me give some advice. He's very into sharks at the moment. \n[153] \n[154]   \n[155]Not tonight, ma. \n[156]No where. \n[157]I ought to fucking kill you. \n[158]You had to do it. \n[159]You just do whatever the fuck you want. And consequences don't matter, do they? \n[160]What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you? \n[161]You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. She's a Yale grad student. Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world. \n[162] \n[163]He should be here any minute. Calm down. \n[164]What the fuck are you doing? \n[165]I uninvited you. \n[166]Why are you wearing that? \n[167] \n[168]Because you know why. Just go home. \n[169]Hey. \n[170]Yeah. The have this intensive summer orientation thing. \n[171]Well, it's optional, but dad thinks it would be \"a good way to meet people.\" \n[172]He usually is. \n[173]Thanks. \n[174]Everything you'd let me bring.

Maybe I should try it. \n[5]Stop it! \n[6]Sorry I asked. \n[7]I'll accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there. \n[8]The frozen food woman came in with her kids.
