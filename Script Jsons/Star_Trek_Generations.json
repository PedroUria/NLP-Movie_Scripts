Are you prepared to face the charges? \n[2]There can be only one punishment for such crimes... I hereby promote you to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, with all the rights and privileges thereto. And may God have mercy on your soul. \n[3] \n[4]Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One? \n[5]  \n[6]Well, now that we're all aboard... Number One, bring the ship before the wind. Let's see what's out there. \n[7]  \n[8]Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines... no computers... just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you. \n[9]Picard here. \n[10]  \n[11] \n[12]   \n[13]Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me... \n[14]Computer, exit. \n[15]Secure from Red Alert. Number One, begin an investigation. I'll be in my Ready Room. \n[16] \n[17]There's still no indication of why they attacked the station? \n[18]Hmm... Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector. \n[19]Is there a problem? \n[20]Thank you, Number One. \n[21]Understood. That will be all. \n[22]No. Thank you. \n[23]  \n[24]Doctor Soran...? \n[25]Nothing for me. I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me. \n[26]Doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then -- \n[27]We're doing the best we can. Now if you'll excuse me... \n[28]I'll see what I can do... \n[29]  \n[30]Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. \n[31]Come. \n[32]Counselor. What can I do for you? \n[33]Well... I appreciate your concern, but I'd rather not discuss it right now, thank you. \n[34]As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed... but also when you're not. \n[35]Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now. \n[36]All right, all right. You've made your point. \n[37]The message I received... My brother... and his son -- my nephew -- burned to death in a fire. \n[38]What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene -- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone... \n[39]In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own. \n[40] \n[41] \n[42]You know, Counselor... I'm not getting any younger. For some time now, I've been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind... But I always took comfort in the fact that when I was gone, my family would continue. But now... \n[43]I've had brushes with death... more than I care to contemplate. I always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform. But now... the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it. \n[44]I'm the last Picard. \n[45]Report. \n[46]How is that possible? \n[47]How long until the shock wave hits the observatory? \n[48]Enterprise to Commander Riker, you have two minutes left. \n[49]What? \n[50] \n[51]Do you remember him? \n[52]Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon... a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to -- \n[53]What's the \"Nexus\"? \n[54]What happened to you? \n[55]But then you were beamed away... \n[56]Your \"sixth sense\"... I've always wondered where it came from... And what about Soran? \n[57]But why destroy a star...? Thank you, Guinan. \n[58]When is it expected back? \n[59]Data? \n[60]Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star. \n[61]Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed... no matter how insignificant... \n[62]Data, are you all right? \n[63]What do you mean? \n[64]Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with. \n[65]No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience... guilt. \n[66]Wait. The Bozeman... why did it change course? \n[67]  \n[68]Can you project its course? \n[69] \n[70]Courage is an emotion too, Data. Now... can you project the course of the ribbon? \n[71]Enhance grid A-nine. \n[72]Where was the Amargosa star? \n[73]Now... you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered... could that also affect the course of the ribbon? \n[74]That's what Soran's doing... he's changing its course. But why? Why try to alter its path... why not simply fly into it with a ship? \n[75]He can't go to the ribbon... so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him. Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets? \n[76]It's very close to Veridian Three... but not close enough... \n[77]Data, what would happen to the ribbon's path if he destroyed the Veridian star itself? \n[78]That's where he's going. \n[79] \n[80]Are any of them inhabited? \n[81]Population? \n[82] \n[83]Red Alert, Mister Worf. Set a course for the Veridian system, maximum warp. \n[84]Klingon vessel. We know what you're doing, and we will destroy any probe launched toward the Veridian star. \n[85]They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird of Prey is any match for the Federation flagship. \n[86]Mister Data, scan the planet for life forms. \n[87]Commander. \n[88]Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives? \n[89] \n[90]On screen. \n[91]Lursa, I want to talk to Soran. \n[92]Then I'll beam down to his location. Just give us his coordinates. \n[93]Very well... I'll beam to your ship and you can transport me to Soran... \n[94]Me... If you let me speak to Soran. \n[95]Agreed. \n[96]Number One, you have the Bridge. Have Doctor Crusher meet me in Transporter Room Three. \n[97]Energize. \n[98]The thought had crossed my mind... \n[99]You don't need to do this, Soran... I'm sure we could find another way to get you into this Nexus. \n[100]Not if it means killing over two hundred million people. I wonder... did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder? \n[101] \n[102]What you're about to do is no different from when the Borg destroyed your world. \n[103]We're all. mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of our existence. \n[104]The Nexus. \n[105]Thank you. \n[106]   \n[107]  \n[108]    \n[109]What's going on? Where am I? \n[110]  \n[111]  \n[112]  \n[113]I... don't know what to say... \n[114] \n[115]Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly beautiful. All of it. \n[116]Thank you... I can't imagine what it is. \n[117]You mean a sextant. And it's a handsome one at that... from about eighteen twenty, I'd say. Wherever did you find it? \n[118] \n[119]  \n[120]  \n[121]   \n[122]  \n[123] \n[124]No... this isn't right... this can't be real... \n[125]Guinan... what's going on? Where am I? \n[126]This... is the Nexus? \n[127]But I never had a wife, children, a home like this... \n[128]Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise. \n[129]Left behind...? \n[130]Soran...? \n[131]Where is he now? \n[132] \n[133](continuing, awed, to \n[134]Go on... go on without me... \n[135]Guinan... can I leave the Nexus? \n[136] \n[137]I don't understand. \n[138]I know exactly where I want to go... and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian Three... before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him. \n[139]You're right. I'll need help. Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could -- \n[140]James Kirk. \n[141]Yes... yes, it is. \n[142]Oh. \n[143]Captain, do you realize what -- \n[144]I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise. \n[145] \n[146]I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't Really your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus. \n[147]How long have you been here? \n[148]History records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon eighty years ago... \n[149]Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of... \n[150]Captain, I need your help. I want you to leave the Nexus with me. \n[151]We have to go back to a planet called Veridian III and stop a man from destroying a star. There are millions of lives at stake. \n[152]You're a Starfleet Officer and you have a duty to -- \n[153] \n[154]Better? \n[155] \n[156]That's right. \n[157]I hadn't planned on it. \n[158]You don't need to be on the Bridge of a starship. Come with me. Help me stop Soran. Make a difference again. \n[159]That's right. \n[160]You could say that. \n[161]   \n[162] \n[163]  \n[164]  \n[165]I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right. \n[166]Yes. Thank you. \n[167]Try to hang on. \n[168]  \n[169]Yes. \n[170]You needn't worry about the Doctor anymore. \n[171]Was there a problem with the Klingons? \n[172]Captain's log, stardate 48650.1. The starship Farragut has arrived in orbit and has begun to beam up the Enterprise survivors for transport back to Earth. \n[173] \n[174] \n[175]It's not how many years you've lived, Wil... but how you've lived them. Someone once told me that time is a predator that stalks us all our lives. But maybe time is also a companion who goes with us on our journey, and reminds us to cherish the moments of our lives... because they will never come again. We are after all. only mortal. \n[176]You may still... somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise. \n[177] ", "Data": "\n[1] \n[2]Ah. \n[3]Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain. \n[4]  \n[5]Is she still angry? \n[6]I was attempting to... get in the spirit of things. I thought it would be humorous. \n[7]It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time. \n[8]That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more \"human\" - to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer. \n[9]Agreed. \n[10]I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response. \n[11]I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions... I am unable to articulate the sensation. \n[12] \n[13]Yes. I hate this! It is revolting! \n[14]Please. \n[15] \n[16]When you said to Commander Riker... \"The clown can stay, but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go.\" \n[17]During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punch line. \n[18]I know. I just got it. It was very funny. \n[19] \n[20] \n[21]I believe I can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo. \n[22] \n[23] \n[24] \n[25] \n[26]I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays. \n[27]Please don't hurt me. \n[28]I... cannot, sir. I believe I Am... afraid. \n[29]I am quite... preoccupied with concern about Geordi. \n[30]I hope so, sir. \n[31]According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty-nine point one years \n[32]Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours. \n[33]The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon. \n[34]It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information. \n[35]No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate... I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of... remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory. \n[36]I wanted to save Geordi... I tried. but I experienced something I did not expect. I believe it was fear. \n[37]But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend. Does that make me a coward? \n[38] \n[39]According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by five percent... the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction... a research project on Gorik Four was halted due to increased neutrino particles... ambient magnetic fields have decreased by -- \n[40] \n[41]This is its current position. \n[42]I do not wish to remove the chip, sir. Although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with... I cannot imagine going back to a life without them. I have taken an important step toward becoming truly human. If I were to turn back now... I would like to continue in my duties, sir. \n[43]I believe so. \n[44] \n[45]Our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged. \n[46] \n[47]It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa. \n[48]Veridian Three is uninhabited. but Veridian Four supports a pre- industrial humanoid society. \n[49]Approximately two hundred thirty million. \n[50]I was hoping you would ask me to do that, Captain. I just love to scan for life forms. \n[51] \n[52]Sorry, sir. There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading. \n[53]Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir. \n[54] \n[55]Hull breach on decks thirty-one Through thirty-five. \n[56]  \n[57] \n[58]I have accessed their coil frequency... initiating ionic pulse... \n[59] \n[60]One minute to warp core breach. \n[61]Separation complete. Ten seconds to warp core breach. \n[62]  \n[63]Oh, shit. \n[64] \n[65] \n[66]I am very happy to find you, Spot. \n[67]I am not sure, Counselor. I am happy to see Spot... and yet I am crying. My emotional program must be malfunctioning again. ", "Chekov": "\n[1] \n[2] \n[3]Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters... That way. \n[4]Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony. \n[5]Captain... \n[6]Demora! \n[7] \n[8]You met her once before, but she was... \n[9]Twelve years, sir. \n[10] \n[11]What the hell is that? \n[12]How many people were aboard that ship? \n[13] \n[14]You and you. You've just become nurses. Let's go. \n[15]It will be all right. We're going to take care of you. \n[16]  \n[17]Easy there... \n[18]It's going to be okay. Here, just lie down. \n[19]My God... Was anyone in there? \n[20]I never thought it would end like this... ", "Soran": "\n[1]Why...why? \n[2]No... I have to go... I have to get back... You don't understand! Let me go! \n[3]Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran... \n[4]I'm not sure... it happened so fast... \n[5]Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for coming. \n[6]Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star. \n[7]The timing is very important on my experiment -- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost. \n[8]  \n[9]  \n[10]  \n[11]Is there a problem, gentlemen? \n[12]  \n[13]I'd be happy to. \n[14]You got careless. The Romulans came looking for their missing trilithium. \n[15]They knew it was aboard the observatory. If the Enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it. \n[16]I have the weapon, Lursa. And if you ever want me to give it to you, I advise you to be a little more careful in the future. \n[17]Without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the Klingon Empire. \n[18]Set course for the Veridian system. Maximum warp. \n[19]Bring him with me. I need some answers from Mr. La Forge. \n[20]  \n[21]Normal is what everyone else is... and what you are not. \n[22]As you may or may not be aware, I am an El-Aurian. Some people call us a race of \"listeners\". We listen. Right now, Mr. La Forge, you have my undivided attention. I want to listen to everything you know about trilithium. and me. \n[23]I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium... why? \n[24]Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information, and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium? \n[25]What about... Guinan? What has she told you about me? \n[26]My instincts tell me you're lying. And I know that can't be easy for you... I can see you have a good heart. \n[27]Oh... I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle. A little trick I picked up from the Borg. \n[28]I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage? \n[29]We learn something new about ourselves every day. Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows. \n[30]I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge. Let's try thirty seconds. \n[31]No. His heart just isn't in it. \n[32]Prepare to transport me to the surface. \n[33]This contains all the information you'll need to build a trilithium weapon. It's been coded. Once I'm safely to the surface, I'll transmit the decryption sequence to you... not before. \n[34]There's no time for this. Eliminate them. \n[35]I think it's time we gave Mister La Forge his sight back. \n[36]You must think I'm quite the madman. \n[37]The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan. Good luck. \n[38]  \n[39]Nice try. \n[40]You're right. And there was a time when I wouldn't have hurt anyone. Then the Borg came... and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe, it's death. Afterwards, I began to realize that none of it mattered. We're all going to die anyway. It's only a question of how and when. You will too, Captain. You might contract a fatal disease... you might die in battle... \n[41]... or burn to death in a fire. \n[42]You looked surprised. But you shouldn't be. I've been to the Nexus, Captain. I know things about people. Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you? It's like a predator. It's stalking you. You can try to outrun it with doctors... medicines.new technologies... but in the end, time is going to hunt you down... and make the kill. \n[43]What if I told you I found a new truth... \n[44]Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth. \n[45]Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt. \n[46] \n[47]Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with eternity and I don't want to be late. \n[48]  \n[49]   \n[50]Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with Eternity and I don't want to be late. \n[51]  \n[52]  \n[53] \n[54] \n[55]  \n[56]No... \n[57]\n[58]  ", "Demora": "\n[1]It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some... interesting stories about you. \n[2]Yes, sir. \n[3]Thank you, sir. Let me show you the new inertial guidance system. \n[4]The ships are bearing at three one zero mark two one five. Distance: Three light years. \n[5]We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain. \n[6] \n[7] \n[8]Aye, sir. \n[9](continuing; shakes her \n[10]Sir!

Get in the spirit of things. \n[3]Data...Data -- ! \n[4]I'm picking up life signs... about twenty meters ahead. \n[5]Over here. \n[6]It looks like a power surge fused the emotional chip into his neural net. \n[7]I don't think so. The chip still seems to be working. I'd feel better if I could take a closer look, but I can't remove it without completely dismantling his cerebral conduit. \n[8]Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's background. \n[9]He's an El-Aurian... over three hundred years old. He lost his entire family when the Borg destroyed his world. Soran escaped with a handful of other refugees aboard a ship called the Lakul. The ship was destroyed by some kind of energy ribbon, but Soran and forty-six others were rescued by the Enterprise-B. \n[10]I checked the passenger manifest of the Lakul... guess who else was on board? \n[11] \n[12]... and some myocardial degeneration. I'm going to give you some hematozine, and I want to run more tests... but I think you're going to be fine. \n[13]  \n[14]Two hundred thirty-two patients in under two days. \n[15] \n[16]No -- that one's for me.

I still don't know why you dropped her in the water. \n[3]Data... you're not thinking about using that thing are you? \n[4]Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net. \n[5]All right... \n[6]But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. agreed? \n[7]Well...? \n[8]Really? What do you feel? \n[9]I'll explain later... \n[10]Data, I think the chip is working... \n[11] \n[12]You get what? \n[13]What? \n[14]The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago. \n[15]Thanks. \n[16]Wait a minute... there's a hidden doorway here. I can see the joint of the metal with my VISOR. \n[17]I don't see a control panel...or an access port. \n[18]I'm still not picking up anything. Someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room. \n[19]Data, take a look at this.

La Forge to Enterprise. \n[26]Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter of fact, there is. There's a damping field in here blocking our com signal. Will you give me a hand? \n[27]What's normal? \n[28]What do you want? \n[29]Trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the Romulans.

We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium. \n[14]An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it. \n[15]Aye, sir. \n[16]Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago. \n[17]Sir, the implosion has produced a level twelve shock wave. \n[18] \n[19]Four minutes, forty seconds. \n[20]I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters. \n[21]Will that be a danger to him? \n[22]Worf here, sir. \n[23]Sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the Klingon ship or the planet's surface will take eleven seconds to reach the star. However, since we do not know the exact point of origin, it will take us between eight and fifteen seconds to lock our weapons onto it. \n[24]Captain, Klingon vessel decloaking directly ahead. \n[25]They are hailing. \n[26] \n[27]It is a Class D-twelve Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils. \n[28]I do not see how. The plasma coil is part of their cloaking device... \n[29] \n[30]Aye, sir. \n[31]Captain, are you all right? ", "Troi": "\n[1]Answer him! \n[2]  \n[3] \n[4] \n[5]Actually... I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you. \n[6]I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's Counselor, it's my duty to -- \n[7]You can't fool an empath, Captain. I know exactly when I'm needed. \n[8]Very well. I suppose I could make out my weekly report to Starfleet Command without your input. \"Admiral Lusby... regarding the unusual behavior of Jean-Luc Picard: I find him increasingly Irritable... remote... and uncooperative. I recommend forced shore leave at a Starbase facility in order to --\" \n[9]Captain, I'm sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother. \n[10]It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies... But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you. \n[11]Your family history is very important to you, isn't it? \n[12]... You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line. \n[13]There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life... your own career. \n[14]Captain, perhaps we -- \n[15] \n[16]Or perhaps they're on the surface... \n[17]Engaging impulse engines. \n[18]Helm controls are off-line! \n[19]Over here, Data! I think I've found something. \n[20] \n[21]Another family reunited. \n[22]Data... are you all right? \n[23]No, Data... I think it's working perfectly. ", "Riker": "\n[1]Bring out the prisoner! \n[2]\"We, the officers and crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound mind and judgment, hereby make the following charges against Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions. Two. That he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years. And Three. Most seriously... that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew.\" \n[3]Extend the plank!! \n[4]When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember? \n[5]  \n[6]Aye, aye, sir. Take the wheel, Commander. \n[7] \n[8]  \n[9]Bad food, brutal discipline... No women. \n[10]Set the royals and the studding sails, Mister Worf. \n[11] \n[12]Riker here. \n[13] \n[14]It looks like we're too late... \n[15]The station complement was nineteen. \n[16]Sir? \n[17]Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan. \n[18]Worf, you're with me. Paskall, you and Mendez search the upper deck. \n[19]I'm Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. \n[20]Who attacked you, Doctor? \n[21]We found two dead Romulans aboard the station. We're analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from. \n[22]We think they were looking for something -- they practically tore the place apart. \n[23]You want me to contact Starfleet? \n[24]No, sir. \n[25]There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists. a Doctor Soran... has insisted on speaking with you. I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away. \n[26]Sir... is there anything wrong? \n[27]Trilithium? \n[28]Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense. \n[29] \n[30]Red Alert! All hands to duty stations! \n[31]A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclear fusion is breaking down. \n[32]The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes. \n[33] \n[34]Mister Worf. \n[35] \n[36] \n[37]  \n[38]Data! See if you can get to Geordi! \n[39] \n[40]How is he? \n[41] \n[42]We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back. \n[43] \n[44]Maybe they're not out there. \n[45] \n[46] \n[47]Then return him. \n[48]Lock phasers and return fire! \n[49] \n[50] \n[51]Plasma coils... is there any way we can use that to our advantage? \n[52] \n[53]Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds. Data, lock onto that plasma coil. \n[54]Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak. \n[55]We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode. \n[56]Make it quick! \n[57]Fire! \n[58]  \n[59]  \n[60]Report. \n[61] \n[62]  \n[63] \n[64]Is this it? \n[65]I'm going to miss this ship.

I jump out over the Arabian Peninsula... and I end up here, right on the dime. \n[2]Thanks for pointing that out. \n[3]Oh... \n[4]Tomorrow I want to make a tri- elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China, and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry... \n[5]I'm not going. Scotty, help me with this chute. \n[6]When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it. \n[7] \n[8]It's our pleasure. \n[9]Well... may we have a look around? \n[10]Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way... \n[11]I've been... keeping busy. \n[12]Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your father? \n[13]But that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than... \n[14]Yes... well... congratulations, Ensign. It wouldn't be the Enterprise without a Sulu at the helm. \n[15]You know, Scotty... it amazes me. \n[16]Sulu. When did he find the time for a family? \n[17]With that kind of tact, I'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist. \n[18]Oh... of course. \n[19]No... no. Thank you. \n[20] \n[21]Tractor beam... \n[22]You left spacedock without a tractor beam? \n[23] \n[24] \n[25]And second -- turn that damned thing off. \n[26]Scotty? \n[27]Phasing? To where? \n[28]Report! \n[29]  \n[30]I thought you might. \n[31]A photon torpedo? \n[32] \n[33]Don't tell me... Tuesday. \n[34] \n[35]No... a Captain's place is on the Bridge of his ship. I'll take care of it. \n[36] \n[37]Kirk here. \n[38]That's it. Go! \n[39]   \n[40]Beautiful day, isn't it? \n[41]Do you mind? \n[42]Wait a second. I think something's burning. \n[43]   \n[44]Looks like someone was cooking eggs... Come on in, it's all right. This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago. \n[45]This clock... I gave this clock to Bones... \n[46]  \n[47] \n[48]Wait a minute... \n[49]The future... what are you talking about? This is the past... \n[50]This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet... \n[51]These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite.I was cooking them to soften the blow... And I gave her this. \n[52]Dill weed. \n[53]There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg. \n[54]I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you? \n[55]  \n[56] \n[57]Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you. Something's missing... \n[58]  \n[59]You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history? \n[60]  \n[61] \n[62]This time things are going to be different. \n[63]No... no, it's not. It's better. \n[64]This is my uncle's barn in Iowa... \n[65] \n[66]Just like this. If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia. \n[67]This Nexus of yours is very clever. I can start all over again -- do things right from day one. \n[68]  \n[69] \n[70]It's kinda like... orbital skydiving. Exciting for a few minutes... but in the end, you haven't really done anything... you haven't made a difference... \n[71]Captain of the Enterprise, huh? \n[72]Close to retirement? \n[73]Well, let me tell you something - don't. Don't let them promote you... don't let them transfer you... don't let anything take you off the Bridge of that ship... Because while you're there, you can make a difference. \n[74]How can I argue with the Captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that Planet... Veridian III? \n[75]I take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim? \n[76] \n[77]Sounds like fun. \n[78]  \n[79] \n[80]  \n[81]The twenty-fourth century isn't so tough. \n[82]Nice shot. \n[83]Did we do it?
