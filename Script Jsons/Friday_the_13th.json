Always have been.  Since I was a kid. \n[39]I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can hear the sound.  I try to close my ears off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets louder.  The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers.

It makes no sense, but it spooks me. \n[19]Artist. \n[20]What'd you see? \n[21]      \n[22]I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything. I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife. \n[23]I don't know. \n[24]I'll be along. \n[25]I didn't know I was asleep...What time is it? \n[26]Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.

It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them. \n[52]Well, it hasn't been that long. \n[53]I think we should go wake them up.  Just in case. \n[54]I guess... \n[55]Good night, Brenda. \n[56]Absolutely. \n[57]I don't here it anymore. \n[58]It sounded like Brenda. \n[59]Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field? \n[60]They're off now. \n[61]Okay. \n[62] \n[63]Brenda?

Take a second... \n[29]I had to. \n[30]I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite. \n[31]This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China. \n[32]A short somewhere. \n[33] \n[34]Lemme see.
