Never. \n[2]Route six. \n[3]We did it.  All of them. \n[4]One finger, weak.  All fingers working together, strong. ", "Nicolai": "", "Chuck": "\n[1]My guess is we're talking fuel filters here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these jitneys get in the mountains, their engines cut out. \n[2]Easy.  Each way. \n[3]So it finally turned up... \n[4]I'll catch the sweep tonight. \n[5]It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what -- \n[6]So how are we going to get this place shaped up? \n[7]There's only one way.  We have to work together.  Every one of us depends on everyone else.  If one package is late, we are all late.  If one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. Let's start by taking a look around. \n[8]Here, this table is too far from the wall.  Packages can slip down...like... ...this. \n[9]What could be in here?  Let's say one of you sent it.  Could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive.  I don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table. \n[10]Kamal?  Right.  I'm getting them. \n[11]I'm looking at the blueprints of K.L. right now.  The belts are too small for the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. Look, it's -- \n[12]  \n[13]I'm going out on every route, I'm going to work every job here, until I know enough to help you.  That's it. \n[14]Worse than Warsaw. \n[15]The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget. \n[16]You sorted your packages before you left. None of the other drivers did. \n[17]So how come the other drivers haven't left yet? \n[18]Tell me exactly what he said. \n[19]Lev -- it's Lev, right?  Listen, this is FedEx.  We don't have to accept the way it is. \n[20]No, keep trying.  A circuit's bound to open up. \n[21] \n[22]Hello?  Great.  Try it. \n[23]Kelly, damn, look, this is Chuck.  I'm going to be a little late.  Well, more than a little.  I had to go to Russia. Couldn't be helped.  Could you call and cancel the trip?  Look, we'll sail the Keys in March.  It's better then anyway. I'll be back before Christmas.  I promise.  I think.  I mean, I will.  I, uh -- \n[24]I miss you. \n[25]Only one still left? \n[26] \n[27]Let's go. \n[28]That's Bermuda.  Bermuda is in the Memphis thru container.  No, Azores is Europe. \n[29]The Paris container.  Africa too.  Japan goes to Memphis. \n[30]Great job, everyone.  Remember, work together.  We are like a hand... \n[31]You got it. \n[32]I absolutely, positively, have to get to Memphis overnight. \n[33]Jack -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly.  Gwen, aren't you worried? \n[34]We're on time, right? \n[35]Little present from the emerging republics. \n[36]What connects the world?  What makes it one? We do.  FedEx. \n[37]Borrowed.  I borrowed it. \n[38]Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change. \n[39]You what? \n[40]I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up. \n[41]Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team... \n[42]You fucked us over. \n[43]I was making a point. \n[44]Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point. \n[45]Baloney.  I do see the damn \"big picture.\" \n[46]It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered. \n[47]And never take. \n[48]Forget it. \n[49]I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention. \n[50]That's why you're a gambling man. \n[51]For the third time. \n[52]You are one sick fucker. \n[53]This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal. \n[54]A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month. \n[55]Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not? \n[56]Let's go off-line. \n[57]Two Valium... \n[58] Chuck drops his briefcase and his bag.  The place is a jumble of clothes, papers, books, etc.  In the living room is a tank of tropical fish.  The water looks a little green.  No bubbles are coming from the filter.  Uh oh.  Chuck walks to the tank.  He tightens a piece of tape that holds the power cord onto the filter, taps the filter with his finger, once, twice...the bubbles start again.  \n[59]Damn thing. \n[60]Sorry, I'm really sorry. \n[61] Chuck digs a small hole in the back yard with a large kitchen spoon.  Drops the dead fish in.  Fills the hole.  \n[62] The CD is playing.  Chuck lies in bed, switches on the TV. This is no good.  He doesn't care how late it is, he's going to find Kelly.  \n[63]You seen Kelly Frears? \n[64]Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you. \n[65]You smell like formaldehyde. \n[66]Let's take a look. \n[67]Cold. \n[68]I thought I did. \n[69]Got to follow the paper path here. \n[70]Used to you could fix these yourself. \n[71]What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did? \n[72]And I can't fix this damn machine. \n[73]That's carcinogenic. \n[74]On the other hand we could not take a swim... \n[75]Becca, as you know St. Petersburg was consistently running late by six to ten hours -- sometimes a full day or more.  I replaced the station manager.  We identified inefficiencies and worked out a quality improvement plan I believe can be met. \n[76]Jim's a terrific financial man, no question.  But we can't always parachute in from Memphis.  We've got to build up our local staff. \n[77]We're building a new team here.  We got every package on the truck for the first time ever.  Success is the best teacher. \n[78]Not if you work for FedEx. \n[79]Four four.  A record. \n[80]Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better. \n[81]One of those packages just moved. \n[82]Hey, look at you. \n[83]He is a cute thing. \n[84]I can't even keep fish alive. \n[85]And for you -- \n[86]You know, for when you travel. \n[87]I wasn't sending a message.  I though you'd like it. \n[88]I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub. \n[89]You did? \n[90]Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go. \n[91]I have to. \n[92]What should we call him?  Or is it her? How about Jango? \n[93]We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting. \n[94]Could you watch Jango? \n[95]I can't take him to work. \n[96]We'll talk about it when I come back. It'll all be fine.  Really. \n[97]Kelly?  Kelly? \n[98]There.  There.  Easy now. \n[99]Kelly? \n[100] Chuck gets into his car, puts Jango on the front seat next to him.  Pulls out of the driveway.  \n[101]Mom, meet Jango. \n[102]Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen. \n[103]Great. \n[104]So did I. \n[105]It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me. \n[106]Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom? \n[107]Come on Roger, this is dad all over again.  You already did beefalo, chinchillas, and what was that, ostrich? They chased Mom around the yard, sprained her hip. \n[108]But chickens? \n[109]True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know. \n[110]Really? \n[111]Just don't count 'em before they hatch. \n[112]Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream. \n[113]Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here... \n[114]The place is falling apart. \n[115]Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me. \n[116]Come on inside, Mom.  You've had a long day. \n[117]I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg. \n[118]Terrific.  Yours? \n[119]And get me in to the dentist.  My tooth's acting up. \n[120]Right. Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia. \n[121]Kamal?  Kamal?  Can you hear us? \n[122]Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us? \n[123]Who is this?  Where is Kamal? \n[124]What's going on down there? \n[125]Who's in charge then, where is Chinn? \n[126]When's the next Jumbo? \n[127]Anything else? \n[128]Call Operations.  Get me on it. \n[129] Chuck leaves with his bag over his shoulder and the puppy under his arm.  \n[130]It's our dog.  It belongs to us. \n[131]Yes there is. \n[132]No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill -- \n[133]I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt. \n[134]Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. \n[135]Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep. \n[136]A week, max.  Okay?  Okay? \n[137]Al -- gotta be something wrong with our physicals, you keep getting certified to fly.  John, aren't you worried? \n[138]You're on your way home, Al? \n[139]We're on time, right? \n[140] Everything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier drugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the cabin also TWISTS and TILTS.  Chuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is nightmarish.  Is this really happening?  \n[141] The pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life jackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in a cloud of fear.  \n[142] The fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing up a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point end in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.  \n[143] as he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He's thirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We stay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in the sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther. He picks up another package.  \n[144]All right, guys.  I'm here.  Check the GPS, get moving. \n[145]Where the fuck are you? \n[146]Sonofabitch. \n[147]That was smart, really smart. \n[148]Ahhh. \n[149]Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean airliner did. \n[150]Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where you are within, say 500 miles.  That's a circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared. So, uh, 250,000 times three point one four, that's about 800,000 square miles. Three times the size of Texas. \n[151]They could use a satellite. \n[152]Say each satellite photo is 30 feet square, that's uh...fuck it...billions and billions of photos. \n[153]Aw, someone will come. \n[154]What the hell? \n[155]Oh Jesus. \n[156]I'm so sorry, Al.  So sorry. \n[157]Got to cover Al up. \n[158]Got to cover Al up. \n[159]We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine... \n[160]Yellow submarine.  We all live in a yellow submarine... \n[161]Bad idea.  Should have saved some. \n[162]Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play? \n[163]Shit! \n[164]Got to get there.  Got to see.  C'mon... c'mon.  Don't be such a wuss.  Be bold. \n[165]No way on.  No way off. \n[166]This is bad.  Really, really bad. \n[167]Come on.  Crawl if you have to. \n[168]Got to drink.  Got to drink something. \n[169]They don't belong to you. \n[170]Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat. \n[171]Oh, God.  Thank you. \n[172]You deserve a break today... \n[173]Damn fish! \n[174]Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute. \n[175]Don't leave home without it. \n[176]Yuck. \n[177]Yumm. \n[178]Got to get this fixed. \n[179]Water, water, everywhere, water, water everywhere... \n[180]Where's the water on this fucking island? \n[181]Just rest a minute. \n[182]Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. \n[183]Let's see, I waited two days. Then I buried Al. Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then American Express got me those clam things... I dug all those damn holes, the clouds over the moon... And today, the historic discovery of H, Two, Oh. Ten days.  Shit. \n[184]A crab, it's a crab. \n[185]Dammit! \n[186]I did it.  I did it! \n[187]Jesus. \n[188]Stupid fucking thing! \n[189]I don't know what I did, God, but whatever is was, I am really, really sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry. \n[190]Don't have a choice, do I? \n[191]Okay.  Okay now. \n[192]You're not getting it hot enough.  Got to hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat. \n[193]Sonofabitch! \n[194]Come on.  Come on. \n[195]No.  No.  No. \n[196]That's the big dipper...Orion...or is that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would know. \n[197]Dammit! \n[198]Careful now, careful... \n[199]Yes!  Yes!  Yes! \n[200]If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I am sure I did, thank you now. \n[201]Damn tooth! \n[202]Beautiful.  So beautiful. \n[203]A star.  It's a star. \n[204]It's a ship. \n[205]Timberrr! \n[206]I heard that... \n[207]No more waiting.  Take action. \n[208]That's right.  Take action. \n[209]How could I be so stupid? \n[210]Stupid, stupid, stupid. \n[211] Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything -- different rafts, different approaches, but each time the ocean spits him back.  \n[212]You're too low in the water.  Too damn low. \n[213]Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure -- and unto dust shalt thou return. \n[214]Shit! \n[215]Please...please...please... \n[216]Firewood.  I need firewood. \n[217]What the fuck are you doing? \n[218]Hang on.  Just hang on. \n[219]Shit.  Shit.  Shit. \n[220]Whoo, pig.  Sooey! \n[221]No pain, no gain. \n[222] We move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs are scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle. A stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A coconut frond hat is on his head.  The hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a berry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is gone.  We come around slowly until we see Chuck's face.  The eyes say it all.  They stare out with a survivor's intensity, staring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.  This is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.  And now he has all the time in the world.  Suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the spear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the bottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end is a struggling fish.  But this isn't a thrill anymore.  It's another day at the office.  \n[223] WHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water shoot into the air.  \n[224] As he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He grins.  There's a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns and strides down the hill.  \n[225]Chips?  Dip? \n[226]No? \n[227]Another fucking day in paradise. \n[228]Help me, Wilson... \n[229] A SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.  \n[230] Throws down the spear and waves his arms.  \n[231]No!  Wait!  Come back! \n[232]Wait!  Wait! \n[233]You old airhead, you need a makeover. \n[234]Wilson, you bad! \n[235]What do you think? \n[236]You don't share much, do you? \n[237]I guess I know how Kelly felt. \n[238]You said our life was a prison.  Dull. Boring.  Empty.  I can't begin to tell you how much that hurt.  I don't want to lose you.  I'm enclosing some salsa, the verde you like.  Use it on your sticky rice and think of home.  Then come home -- to me.  We'll find the spice in our lives again.  Together.  I love you. Always.  Bettina. \n[239]He never got it. \n[240]She's probably found someone else.  I would have. \n[241] Close-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck's face and body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck being transformed.  Chuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses it into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow spiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning bolts on his chest on either side of the hand.  \n[242] As he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue stars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning bolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang from his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.  \n[243]Hello. \n[244]What the hell are you waiting for? \n[245]Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave rope.  Spears.  A sail. \n[246]Now I'm hoping that if this is airtight I'll get condensation down here, a cup or so a day.  If I'm careful it should be enough. \n[247]If I never return, know that here lived Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew these paintings.  I made these marks. And then I took my fate in my own hands and set forth to save myself, God willing. \n[248]Wilson, my main man.  Time to go. \n[249]Wonder what odds Stan would give me on this.  I'd say 90-10.  Against. \n[250]Wilson, we're out of here. \n[251]Slow down, damn you! \n[252]Catch it catch it catch it -- \n[253]Save some for tomorrow. \n[254]Catch another fish tomorrow. \n[255]Shit!  Shit!  Shit! \n[256]Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope. \n[257]With what?  There's nothing to fix it with.  This rope comes undone, you're going to drown. \n[258]Just get up and fix it. \n[259]Too tired. \n[260]Get up. \n[261]Feels so good to lie here. \n[262]Get up, damn you. \n[263]Can't.  Need water. \n[264]You've had today's water. \n[265]Thirsty. \n[266]Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it. \n[267]No water, no work. \n[268]Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more. \n[269]Do too much, I'll die. \n[270]Do too little you'll die. \n[271]Going to die anyway. \n[272]Okay, look have an extra swallow. \n[273]No more water, you said. \n[274]Take it. \n[275]No. \n[276]Take it, damn it. \n[277]No. \n[278]Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water. \n[279]Stop.  Enough. \n[280]Think.  Got to use something else. \n[281]If they can't see you, what's the point? \n[282]Survive today, that's the point. \n[283]Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south. \n[284]You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes. \n[285]Moon's too bright. \n[286]You're putting off the inevitable. \n[287]I'm putting it off. \n[288]That's what's happening to you. \n[289]You're rotting away. \n[290]Get water! \n[291]Fix raft first. \n[292]Water water water -- \n[293]You like that? \n[294]Lost your mate? \n[295]You're beautiful.  Marry me. \n[296]You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft. \n[297]No, don't go.  Look, I've got fish. \n[298]Please don't dive.  Please. \n[299]Look what you've done. \n[300]What are you doing? \n[301]Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore. \n[302]You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die. \n[303]Why do they have to die for me? \n[304]They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen. \n[305]Got to eat. \n[306]I am so sorry. \n[307]I'm an angel. \n[308]Here!  Here! \n[309]No...no...no... \n[310]Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor! \n[311]Stop! \n[312]You fucking murderers! \n[313]I know you're talking about me! \n[314] \n[315]Why me?  Why me, God? \n[316]Listen to this, Wilson. Because you piss me off. \n[317]You're falling apart. \n[318]First you eat your fat, then you eat your muscle. \n[319]Then you eat your mind. \n[320]Roll on you deep and dark blue ocean roll. \n[321]I'm late, I'm late, for a very important date. \n[322]I'm lost.  Goodbye. \n[323]No! \n[324]Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep. \n[325]You quitter you quitter you quitter. \n[326]The sea is lovely, dark and deep. \n[327]But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail. \n[328]Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move. \n[329]If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize. \n[330]Die tomorrow or die today. \n[331]That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door... \n[332]Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse. \n[333]Yeah, sure, what? \n[334]I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink... \n[335]What?  Are you sacrificing yourself for me? \n[336]Damn it!  I had to do it! \n[337]I'm sorry! \n[338]I know there's a moral here, God, but right now I'm just going to eat. \n[339]Forgot to say grace.  Sorry Mom. \n[340]Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts and Christ and the bounty about to receive, or something...amen. \n[341]Please don't leak.  Please. \n[342]Don't look at me.  It was that Dorado. \n[343]You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God. \n[344]Thank you for fucking up my life. \n[345]Not again. \n[346]He's going to get you, going to get you... \n[347]Get away from me! \n[348]Get him get him get him. \n[349]Where are you?  Where are you? \n[350]Stop!  You're using energy.  Move slowly. Be patient. \n[351]What are you smiling about?  They'll be back. \n[352]I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly. \n[353]The music ends.  We go back to the table. The waiters have brought dinner.  New York Strip with Bordelaise Sauce. Mushrooms in brown gravy.  Roasted potatoes with garlic and rosemary.  Green Beans with almonds.  Fresh biscuits and cornbread, dripping with butter.  A nice salad with ranch dressing.  A jumbo shrimp cocktail. \n[354]No shrimp. We eat. \n[355] \n[356]Why, bring them all, bring them all. \n[357]Here!  Over here! \n[358]Oh, shiiiittt! \n[359]Permission to come aboard, sir. \n[360]Permission granted. \n[361]May I ask, where are you bound? \n[362]San Francisco.  And you? \n[363]As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself. \n[364]Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie... \n[365]No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on. \n[366]They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean. \n[367]They're on autopilot. \n[368]They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you. \n[369]Damn it!  Don't be so negative! \n[370]Wilson, what's your story? \n[371]I float.  You sink.  End of story. \n[372]I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn. \n[373]It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. \n[374]Shut up. \n[375]Don't shirk, don't procrastinate, don't be lazy.  We're okay today.  We're okay today. \n[376]Shut up. \n[377]Shut the fuck up!  I mean it. \n[378]What's so damn funny? \n[379]You are. \n[380]Jesus. \n[381]Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage. \n[382]It's real. \n[383]Nothing out there but ocean. \n[384]Let's get a second opinion.  Wilson? What do you see? \n[385]Chuck Noland.  Born October 8, 1958. Died -- pick a date -- July 11, 1998. And now the epitaph.  Met deadlines. Kept appointments.  Lost without a trace. \n[386]What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again. \n[387]It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have. \n[388]Then we've just got shit. \n[389]I am writing this to remind myself to live a better life.  If I am lost, perhaps you who find this will be instructed to live a better live yourself.  Live each day.  Love your children.  Don't take anyone for granted. \n[390]Is that it?  Life is a fucking Disney movie? \n[391]You can't make it. \n[392]Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today. \n[393]Please, no sharks. \n[394]Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus. \n[395]Shit!  Wilson! \n[396]Wilson! \n[397]Thank you.  Oh thank you. \n[398]My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict? \n[399]Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache? \n[400]All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein. \n[401]Which I didn't have. \n[402]I am one lucky guy. \n[403]But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now. \n[404]I most definitely say I am. \n[405]Yes, yes he did. \n[406]Not to mention on me. \n[407]Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here. \n[408]Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland... \n[409]Two Valium and the Rolling Stones.  That ring a bell? \n[410]It's me. \n[411]I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker. \n[412]I beat the odds! \n[413]This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack. \n[414]Hey...hey...it's okay! \n[415]No...no...feels good... \n[416]A few things came up.  Or went down. \n[417]You look...wonderful.  I like your hair. \n[418]I thought you might have. \n[419]I know. \n[420]I would have done the same thing. \n[421]You have any children? \n[422]Got a picture? \n[423]Is that Jango? \n[424]Life's just one big joke after another. \n[425]Want to see my raft? \n[426]You should have smelled me. \n[427]I braided them. \n[428]Time I had lots of. \n[429]That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory. And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day. \n[430]Forty-three days. \n[431]Yeah, well...couldn't be helped. \n[432]My epitaph. \n[433]Bad body chemistry.  Made me a little morbid.  But I'm all over that now. \n[434]There was a coffin? \n[435]What was inside? \n[436]That about sums it up. \n[437]The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am. \n[438]The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived. \n[439]Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last. \n[440]Not when you have no choice. \n[441]I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does. \n[442]We're not meant to be alone.  Not like that.  Share life, that's what came to me out there.  Be with someone. \n[443]That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway. \n[444]Great.  Really. \n[445]I don't know.  I really don't know. \n[446]It means a lot...that you came. \n[447]You too. \n[448]You too. \n[449]I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. \n[450]For years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball.  Wilson. \n[451]To Wilson. \n[452]Hallelujah. \n[453]What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about. \n[454]To life. \n[455]Believe me I know. \n[456]But it's not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice. \n[457]When I was going crazy, on the raft, I'd argue with myself about everything. Because everything had a price.  To get anything -- a sip of water, a little corner of shade, an hour's sleep -- I had to let go of something else.  And then I could never get it back. \n[458]You don't win or lose.  You win and lose. \n[459]You win and lose. \n[460]Where's Mom? \n[461]Tell me about it. \n[462]Wow.  Thank you.  Great.  Thank you. Hey, Rasheed, how you doing?  Thank you all. \n[463]Thank you.  Thank you very much... \n[464]Give me a minute.  I've spent four years looking out at an empty ocean. \n[465]It's all so -- big.  You never think you'll miss -- all this.  But I did.  I really, really did.  And I missed all of you. \n[466]You've added some new belts, and what's that? \n[467]Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific. \n[468]I've never heard it this quiet. Shouldn't you all be getting back to work? \n[469]Take your time. \n[470]That's what it's about. \n[471]Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it. \n[472]Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno. \n[473]I need to do it. \n[474]You want to help, help me find the woman who sent this. \n[475]What about the sender? \n[476]Can you find her? \n[477]Thanks.  For everything. \n[478] Chuck leaves the motel, the Angel Box under his arm.  He ties it into a pannier on the side of a bicycle.  \n[479]Check, please. \n[480]When'd you start working here? \n[481]I wanted to come here. \n[482]That was great, Mom, just great. \n[483]I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town? \n[484]Miss that island?  Mom, come on. \n[485]The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next. \n[486]FedEx for Bettina Peterson. \n[487]Charles Noland.  FedEx Special Projects. \n[488]There was an unavoidable delay. \n[489]No. \n[490]As much as anybody. \n[491]Okay.  Sure. \n[492] \n[493]Possible.  So you did those wings? \n[494]They're harder to do than they look. \n[495]Well, I do a little drawing -- \n[496]Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. \n[497]Well, not really, I -- \n[498]To tell you the truth -- you did. \n[499]No.  that was the last one. \n[500]Hey. \n[501]That was my last one. \n[502]Sure. \n[503]Need some help? \n[504]No. \n[505]I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago. \n[506]Sure. \n[507]Yeah. \n[508]Well -- \n[509]I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled. \n[510]Yeah, completely. \n[511]Had a package to deliver. \n[512]I had it on the island with me. \n[513]Yeah, a long one. \n[514]So do I. \n[515]So do I.

Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess? \n[9]You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture. \n[10]I didn't know we had sailboats. \n[11]For all those vacation days you got coming. \n[12]Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis. \n[13]You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go. \n[14]We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.
