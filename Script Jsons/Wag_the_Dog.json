Som'b'y you don't know. \n[78]Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it.... \n[79]\n[80] \n[81]Yes. \n[82]What do you know about them? \n[83]Precisely. \n[84]What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber. \n[85]Here's what you got to do: Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A. \n[86]\n[87]\n[88]\n[89]\n[90]\n[91] \n[92]\n[93]\n[94]Well, I don't know, a lot of these early reports are inflated. \n[95]...who understands Human Nature? \n[96] \n[97]\n[98]...how can any of us know? \n[99]I'm sure that's the worst of it. \n[100]Well, it ain't over til it's over... \n[101] \n[102]How's he doing? \n[103] \n[104]\n[105]\n[106] \n[107]We have some mutual friends in Washington. \n[108]\n[109] \n[110]\n[111]I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party. \n[112]\n[113]What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action. \n[114]If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we... \n[115] \n[116]\n[117] \n[118] \n[119] \n[120] \n[121] \n[122]String a few together.

Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here. \n[132]It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing. You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.
