I'll get a job.  I'll get my own apartment. \n[3]-- I've never worked? -- \n[4]   \n[5]  \n[6]  \n[7]    \n[8]Hello?  Yes, this is Eleanor. -- Where?  Yes, it's right here. \n[9]  \n[10]   \n[11]Hello Baby... \n[12]She's okay.  She woke up and she saw she was alone. \n[13]That's all right. \n[14]None. \n[15]No. \n[16]Maybe... maybe someday.  I'd like that. \n[17]Umm, I'm a little lost. \n[18]They sent me directions and I've got a map, but it's kind of confusing.  Here... it's a place called Hill House? \n[19]What are you doing? \n[20]Did I say something wrong to you? \n[21]  \n[22]    \n[23]Oh!  You scared me. \n[24]Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker? \n[25]I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here? \n[26]  \n[27]Why do you need a chain like that? \n[28]Is there something about the house? \n[29]  \n[30]Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley?  Mrs. Dudley, are you here?  Anybody? \n[31]Wow... \n[32]Hello?  Hello?  Mrs. Dudley? \n[33]Mrs. Dudley? \n[34]Mrs. Dudley. \n[35]I'm Eleanor Vance, I'm with -- \n[36]Hugh Crain. \n[37]  \n[38]They're so beautiful.  Aren't they? \n[39]Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here. \n[40]Why would we -- \n[41]Finally. \n[42]Hello? \n[43]I'm Eleanor but everyone calls me Nell.  Eleanor Vance.  Nell.  I'm really glad you're here.  Really. \n[44]What a beautiful jacket. \n[45]This?  It's from a thrift shop. \n[46]Fifteen dollars. \n[47](embarrassed by the \n[48]I don't know what you mean. \n[49]We couldn't even hear you. \n[50]No one will come any nearer than that. \n[51]My room is right next door.  I think we share a bathroom. \n[52]That's why we're here. \n[53]I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you? \n[54]Not really. \n[55](she knows this \n[56]No. \n[57]I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor. \n[58]So much carving.  It's everywhere. On everything. \n[59]I know. \n[60]Maybe we should wait for them here. \n[61]Theo! \n[62]I love this house.  I really love this house. \n[63]We should go back. \n[64]Theo, I'm scared -- \n[65]Uh... Nell Vance... \n[66]Well, I... uh... \n[67]You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow. \n[68]I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim. \n[69]I only saw Theo drive up. \n[70]Is something wrong? \n[71]What? \n[72]All of you have such interesting problems. \n[73]No... Please, I know how that sounds but... You're all so articulate.  You know how to talk. I feel like I'm here under false pretenses.  It's silly, it's not like... well, all of you have trouble sleeping because you live in the world, and the world is complicated and scary, but nothing's ever happened to me.  So I don't have a reason to sleep badly. \n[74]Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you. \n[75]What's wrong? \n[76]All the carvings. \n[77]That's so sad. \n[78]Here, cover it.  Don't let her touch it. \n[79](she's thinking \n[80]  \n[81]Sorry.  I'm not used to being touched. \n[82]Yes.  I've missed it. \n[83]Good night, Theo. \n[84]     \n[85]  \n[86]Coming, Mother! \n[87]  \n[88]No! \n[89]     \n[90]It's in my room. \n[91]   \n[92]You really didn't hear anything? \n[93]You know it wasn't a joke, Theo. \n[94]Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on? \n[95]Mother always banged on the wall when she needed me.  The night she died... I heard her, but I pretended I didn't.  I was just so sick of it all.  And then the banging stopped.  And in the morning... she was dead.  This is the first I've ever said this to anyone.  That was the job I had, Theo, it's the only job I've ever known, and I failed.  I'm actually a bad person, Theo.  The world doesn't need me. \n[96]  \n[97]Good night, Theo. \n[98]      \n[99]Sorry. \n[100]Am I that bad? \n[101]Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo? \n[102]The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had. \n[103]Couldn't get the last ones.  You? \n[104]There's someone in there!  There's someone in there in the fireplace! \n[105]Jim... \n[106]Somebody was in here.  I saw him. \n[107]Are these yours?  I found them right over there. \n[108]When I first got here I saw a gray car pull up.  I thought it was one of us. \n[109]This is my car. \n[110]How could he have left without his keys? \n[111]What's his first name? \n[112]David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid! \n[113]David? \n[114]No, it's getting worse. \n[115]That smell... oh, God. \n[116]It was very specific. \n[117]In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood. \n[118]I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom. \n[119]I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face. \n[120]Yes. \n[121]I got more scared. \n[122]I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study. \n[123]I don't know.  Maybe I... \n[124]I haven't been with people in a long time. \n[125]My name. \n[126]No... \n[127]Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this? \n[128]Who did this?  Why are you doing this?  I don't know any of you. You don't know me.  Why are you doing this to me? \n[129]Theo... Did you? \n[130]Why? \n[131]I don't know anything.  Whoever did this, please, just... just say so... just... please... this is cruel.  Don't be cruel to me.  I can't stand it.  You don't know me. \n[132]Are you coming to confess? \n[133]Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it? \n[134]It was a stupid thing to do. \n[135](for the absurdity \n[136](still too shaky \n[137]Oh... it's so beautiful... \n[138]Violets.  Somebody must've died here. \n[139]Who? \n[140]Why? \n[141]Yes. \n[142]Why? \n[143]I was just thinking how happy I am right now.  All my life, I've been waiting for an adventure.  And I thought, oh, I'll never have that, adventures are for people who travel long distances, that's for soldiers, that's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with.  And here I am, and something is happening to me. Strange noises in the night. Paintings are calling to me.  And all it cost to get there was five gallons of gas.  I'm getting my adventure. \n[144]Why? \n[145]It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer. \n[146]Hugh Crain.  Can't seem to get away from him. \n[147]I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance? \n[148]Only two days. \n[149]The blest are the dead / Who see not the sight / Of their own desolation... \n[150]A father's joy unjustly snatch'd by a jealous God... \n[151]Suffer the little children unto me. \n[152]Crain's study. \n[153]Erin, Peter and Sean and Emily and Elizabeth... who are you?  And you?  What happened to you?  You died... How did you die? \n[154]  \n[155]There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said. \n[156]You really think it was Luke? \n[157] \n[158]I've never had a pedicure before. \n[159]Red. What else? \n[160]I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo. \n[161]I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in? \n[162]A loft.  That's a lot of room for one person.  Probably.  Maybe there's room for... \n[163]I don't know, you know... \n[164]I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things. \n[165]I better go to bed. \n[166]I think so. \n[167]               \n[168]     \n[169]  \n[170]Who is doing this to me? \n[171]\n[172]No!  Go AWAY! \n[173]-- What do you think? \n[174]No.  No... Jim's not doing -- these things. \n[175]Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is. \n[176]Jim?  I'm done. \n[177]How can he think I'm doing this! \n[178]No.  No, I couldn't do those things: I'm not making it up. \n[179]His second wife.  There was a second wife?  Carolyn. \n[180]She was pregnant. \n[181]Theo!  Jim!  Help! \n[182]The house... it's a maze, that's how you designed it, didn't you, Mister Crain?  So wherever one of your little guests went, the house brought them here.  It's designed to make you come here.  But why? \n[183]Oh, no... Oh... no... no, no... not that... Oh no... Ohhhhhhhhh! \n[184]He hunted all those children in here.  The dead children, Josiah and Elizabeth and all of them... from the books... he took them up here... he played games... the ones from his mills he burned them up in the fireplace but she found out what he did and she killed him -- \n[185]-- he didn't kill her she killed him and ran away with her baby -- \n[186]After Rene... after she killed herself... he turned into a monster.  He did fill the house with children... he did, but... they weren't laughing... \n[187]Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed -- \n[188]And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them! \n[189]Hugh Crain.  He's in the house. He's still here... \n[190]Is this true?  I've been hypnotized? \n[191]It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real? \n[192]This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting! \n[193]-- but the painting! \n[194]I know you think I did that.  I didn't!  Go to the great hall and look in the fireplace! \n[195]Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace! \n[196]Oh, God, you're not going to look... \n[197]  \n[198]Don't leave me. \n[199]I don't think I want any. \n[200]       \n[201]Theo... \n[202]Oh, God.  It's looking for me. \n[203]Theo, my hand.  You're hurting me. \n[204]A child.  No.  No!  I'm right \n[205]Oh, God.  Who was holding my hand? \n[206]I will not let you hurt a CHILD! \n[207]  \n[208]  \n[209]  \n[210]Why do you want <i>me</i>? \n[211]\n[212]Welcome home, Eleanor... \n[213]No. \n[214]I'm here... I'm here... I'm coming to you, I'm coming to you... \n[215]The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me. \n[216]\n[217]     \n[218]   \n[219]  \n[220]           \n[221]  \n[222]  \n[223]  \n[224]  \n[225]They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them! \n[226]  \n[227]Why did you bring me here? \n[228]Why did you call me and tell me to look in the paper for the ad? \n[229]But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect! \n[230]Then who called me? \n[231]  \n[232]  \n[233]   \n[234]Just had to be sure. \n[235]Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment. \n[236]Don't worry about me, Theo.  I'm wanted.  Right here.  I'm home. \n[237]After all... I'm family. \n[238]My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her. \n[239]I have to stay.  You better go.  I could explain it, but you'd never understand. \n[240]No -- \n[241]In the night... \n[242]...In the dark. \n[243]It's not safe for you anymore. The children need me, and Crain is doing everything he can to keep me from them. \n[244]Give me your shoelace. \n[245]Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please. \n[246](to the house, to \n[247]He played hide and seek with the children.  That's how he built the house. \n[248]I know. \n[249]No, no, you leave them alone! \n[250]Hurry. \n[251]Jim!  Theo! \n[252]Nooo, not them! \n[253]Is this where she bashed your brains in? \n[254]When you came in the door?  I bet that was the last thing you expected.  Right?  From <u>Carolyn</u>? You thought, oh, Carolyn, I've taken it all out of her, you thought, Oh, Carolyn, she's no threat.  Carolyn.  Great Grandma Carolyn.  Did you know that? \n[255]She found out what you did, and she knew there was only one way to stop you.  And she stopped you, so you couldn't torture anymore of the living. But you wouldn't even let go of the dead, would you?  Well, now I'm here.  They called me.  Did you know that?  They've been crying out for help for a long time.  And I heard them. \n[256]And I won't let you hurt them anymore. \n[257]Come on, Hugh Crain, you know what to do.  We've both been here before. \n[258]   ", "Jane": "\n[1]It'll take a month to probate the will, Nell!  A month!  Even if Mother left you something, you won't get it in time to pay the rent.  So instead of complaining, you should be thanking Lou for getting you these two weeks to get Mother's things packed. \n[2]Nell? \n[3]Nell.  A job?  Two months and where is this job?  You have no degree, you've never worked -- \n[4]You have no experience in the world... the regular world.  What would you put on a resume? Now we all appreciate what you did for Mother.  Isn't that right, Lou? \n[5]That's why we've been talking. With me getting more time in Accessories, and Lou at the shop all day, we need somebody to take care of Richie, do a little cleaning and cooking.  And in return you can have the extra room. \n[6]You're sure this is all of Mother's jewelry?  The lawyer said to make sure we took it to him... He said there might be some antique pieces.

Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts. \n[8]Her mother died two months ago. She says she really wants to do this.

What's this... this picture? \n[11]This is where we're going? \n[12]I can tell you what this is about. \n[13]No.  Just... when I saw your picture I had a feeling about you, and now that I meet you, I know I was right. \n[14]Eat first, questions later. \n[15]I think I'd fall asleep easily, but just as I start to feel comfortable, I see things in the dark. \n[16]I feel the presence of something watching me.  It's not... scary... not by itself but... I don't want to go to sleep because I'm worried about the thing attacking me.  So when I finally do fall asleep, I'm like a soldier who's fallen asleep at her post.  I feel like I've betrayed myself.  Nell? \n[17]It's an Erard.

Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself. \n[19]He's trying to protect the experiment.  Personally, I don't think he's got a large enough sample for valid results, but as long as the money's good, and the food is good, I'm in. \n[20]Hey!  I heard screaming... \n[21]Oh, look!  There he goes, ol' Hugh Crain! \n[22]Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.

Oh Watts!  Here Wattsy... \n[34]You have to see something. \n[35]It's somebody's idea of a joke. \n[36]I didn't do it. \n[37]So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting? \n[38] \n[39]A thousand dollars each.  Am I sick?  Yes.  Do you know why I only date freshmen?  By the time they're sophomores, they've figured me out. \n[40]The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else. \n[41]Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.

You're disgusting. \n[42]Sometimes saying you're sorry is just not enough. \n[43]Do we still get paid for the week? \n[44]Is that the question of compassion or science? \n[45]She got the child labor stuff from me. \n[46]You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts? \n[47]All night? \n[48]You want company? \n[49]Look, the stairs! \n[50]It's not going to hold your weight. \n[51]Don't! \n[52]You used the wrong test. \n[53]You're not telling us something. \n[54]Oh my God... \n[55]No. \n[56]-- how much is this car worth? \n[57]Get the hell out of the way! \n[58]I'm okay.  Okay.  Just my chest. Just my wind knocked out. \n[59]Sorry about your car, Nell. \n[60] \n[61]We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found... \n[62]Come on, Jesus!  Let's go! \n[63]No you bastard!  Break! \n[64]Watch out! \n[65]Shit!  All right, you sonofabitch... \n[66]Maybe this'll get your attention! \n[67]What? \n[68]We'll get out after this wing burns down.  Let's go.

You're the first. \n[4]I'll show you your room. \n[5]The Purple Room.  You're going to be the first visitors that Hill House has had since Mister Crain died. \n[6]I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust. \n[7]It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night. \n[8]-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark. \n[9]I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. \n[10]Breakfast is at nine.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark. \n[11]I leave, before dark.

My name's Theo. \n[2]And what you're wearing, that's great, too. \n[3]What did it cost? \n[4]That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it! \n[5]Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you? \n[6]A week.  You and I?  We're going to have fun. \n[7]  \n[8]This is so twisted. \n[9]Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper. \n[10]What do you do? \n[11]That depends. \n[12]I'm supposed to be an artist, but I've been really distracted from work by love.  Do you know what I mean? \n[13]Don't tell me Boston is different from New York. \n[14]My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean? \n[15] \n[16]That sounds really nice.  You're lucky.  But you know that. \n[17] \n[18]Maybe you shouldn't touch -- \n[19]Jeez. \n[20]Which one?  Pick any. \n[21]This is a serious question, but do you think the Dudleys ever make love in this room?  They're alone in the house, no one watching.  No one... no one watching.  You can do what you want. \n[22]Here.  Here.  Here. Oh yes!  Oh yes oh YES!  Here! \n[23]Can't you just see it? \n[24](gently, recognizes \n[25] \n[26]You'll never guess. \n[27]No, but Nell's been here longer than I have. \n[28]The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. \n[29]Excuse me. \n[30]When do we take the tests? \n[31]And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck. \n[32]The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us? \n[33]Nell, it was an accident. \n[34]Ever try putting your hair up in a French twist? \n[35]You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? \n[36]No.  The world has missed you. \n[37]You, too.  Happy tossing and turning. \n[38]Nell! \n[39]  \n[40]What is it!? \n[41]Nell! \n[42]Nell! \n[43]Cold.  Oh, God.  Feel it. \n[44]  \n[45]Luke. \n[46]If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him. \n[47]I did just take a bath.  I don't know. \n[48]  \n[49]I did just take a bath. \n[50]Oh, Nell.  Eleven years.  With all due respect to your mother who I'm sure was a saint, I'd have called Doctor Kevorkian, if not for her, for me. \n[51]Well this is a cozy breakfast. \n[52]I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good. \n[53]Your makeup too. \n[54]Maybe they're Mary's. \n[55]He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something. \n[56]Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his. \n[57]Watts? \n[58]David. \n[59]Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside. \n[60]Oh my God, what is it?  Oh, the smell... ohhh. \n[61](looks to Nell for \n[62]You could have. \n[63]No. \n[64]Maybe you did it yourself. \n[65]I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it... \n[66]That's so sad. \n[67]Before he painted your name over Mister Crain. \n[68]Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you. \n[69]Just think about one thing right now: What color? \n[70]Well? \n[71]See, isn't this better than a hit on the head? \n[72]Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch. \n[73]I have a loft. \n[74]You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me? \n[75]My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean? \n[76]All the time. \n[77]Are you sure? \n[78]Okay. \n[79]Nell?  Nell! \n[80]Nell, what's wrong?  What's wrong? Nell, it's locked, let me in! \n[81]Nell, the door is locked.  Open it. \n[82]Nell... \n[83]Nell, the tub! \n[84]   \n[85]Oh, God, your breath... \n[86]It's here. \n[87]Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> -- -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- \n[88] \n[89]Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid. \n[90]It's okay... we're all here... \n[91]What's happening to her? \n[92]Nell, what happened? \n[93]No. \n[94]How could you do this to people? \n[95]Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up. \n[96]Aw, shhh Nell, shhh. \n[97]I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy. \n[98]I do. \n[99]I... I was playing games with her... Big city games... I was bad.  And you, Doctor Morrow, you broke her heart. \n[100]Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night. \n[101]We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning. \n[102]That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake. \n[103]Yeah. \n[104]Maybe someday. \n[105]  \n[106]Nell? \n[107]Luke... Jim...! \n[108]Nell, go with him!  Just go with him. \n[109]  \n[110]She needs help. \n[111] \n[112]He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again. \n[113]   \n[114]Oh, Jesus. \n[115] \n[116]Oh my God we need to call someone? \n[117]Nell -- \n[118]Hurry.  The gas!  Luke... The gas! \n[119]I'm sure she went back to her room. \n[120]  \n[121]Was sure she'd be in here. \n[122]Nell? \n[123]Nell! \n[124]Nell? \n[125]What'd you come back for, babe? \n[126]Let's go, hon.  Don't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just right? \n[127]Then let's go get you one. \n[128]Please, Nell, just see us out. \n[129]Hurry! \n[130]Oh God, we can't get out! \n[131]Nell!  There you -- \n[132]\n[133]I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you? \n[134]But the experiment was a failure. \n[135]Nell?... Nell? "}}
