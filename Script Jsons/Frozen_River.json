I just have a few questions. \n[15]This is about the woman who was with you. \n[16]How long have you known her? \n[17]She's a smuggler. \n[18]Yes. \n[19]Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know. \n[20]How did you happen to meet her? \n[21]I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country. \n[22]If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter.

I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too. \n[113]Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese. \n[114]Count it. \n[115]Well, be sure it's right.

She's always late. \n[54]See ya' tomorrow. \n[55]Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four. \n[56] \n[57]Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last night? \n[58]No, that's okay. \n[59]Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank you... \n[60]You son of a bitch! \n[61]I just need to look inside. \n[62]I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second. \n[63]I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there. \n[64]He's gambling away the money for our house. \n[65]Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail. \n[66]Can I just look? \n[67]Hey! \n[68]That's my car. \n[69] \n[70]You stole it. \n[71]So you just took it...? \n[72]We'll just see what the troopers say about that. \n[73] \n[74] \n[75]If you're in there you better come out. \n[76] \n[77]I'm not kidding, honey, come on out. \n[78]This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys! \n[79] \n[80]Did you see where the bus was headed? \n[81] \n[82]I'm not leaving this here. \n[83]It's not for sale. \n[84]Why's that? \n[85]Does he use them to rob banks or something? \n[86]Where does he live? \n[87]What's in it for you? \n[88]If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this. \n[89]Where? \n[90] \n[91]I'm not crossing that! \n[92]That's Canada. \n[93]What about the border patrol? \n[94]I'm still not crossing that. \n[95] \n[96]What's going on here? \n[97]Twelve hundred. \n[98]Wait, who the fuck are they? \n[99]I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk. \n[100]I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime. \n[101]This isn't a nation. \n[102]Fuck you. \n[103]What if the troopers stop us. \n[104]Twelve hundred. \n[105]You can't have my car. \n[106]You can't have my car. \n[107]No! \n[108] \n[109] \n[110]    \n[111]I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here. \n[112]I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here! \n[113]No. \n[114]At the bus stop on the Rez. \n[115]You don't know that. \n[116]And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No. \n[117]Nothin'. \n[118]It was no big deal. \n[119]Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car. \n[120]It doesn't matter. \n[121]I'll get it tomorrow. \n[122]I didn't have a tow rope. \n[123]Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat? \n[124]There's food. \n[125]   \n[126] \n[127]They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it. \n[128]They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar. \n[129]That's right. \n[130]  \n[131]We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday. \n[132]What about them? \n[133]You told me that already. \n[134]Here, lunch money. \n[135] \n[136]He sells pot to kids? \n[137]You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it. \n[138]Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him? \n[139] \n[140] \n[141]I want my part. \n[142]I want my part. \n[143]No way. \n[144]Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese. \n[145]I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal. \n[146]You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double. \n[147]Suit yourself. \n[148]Three. I got kids. \n[149]Five and Fifteen. \n[150]Stole him? \n[151]Stole him? \n[152]What's going on? \n[153] \n[154]Where's that? \n[155]What the hell is he doing? \n[156]What the hell is going on here? \n[157]Twelve hundred. \n[158]Why would they want to run? \n[159]What's that? \n[160]How much does it cost? \n[161]To get here? \n[162] \n[163]God those are ripe. \n[164]  \n[165]Are they always there? \n[166]Have you ever gotten caught? \n[167]What happened? \n[168]What did you do? \n[169]Smuggling? \n[170]Right, I know. \n[171]Then why don't you count it? \n[172]You're welcome. \n[173]We're even now. \n[174]      \n[175]    \n[176]    \n[177]It's okay. I got it right here. (she waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two fifty five, right? \n[178] \n[179]Wanna to go to the Price Chopper? \n[180] \n[181]Is that so hard to believe? \n[182]Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus. \n[183]Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or not? \n[184]     \n[185]What? \n[186]What is it, again? \n[187]-Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what? \n[188]I got something even better than that. \n[189]The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case. \n[190]This time is for real. \n[191]Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen.  \n[192]If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it.  \n[193]What about him?  \n[194]Why, did he call broke yet?  \n[195]Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad.  \n[196]He's an addict, T.J.  \n[197]You gotta help Ricky get the tree up tomorrow after school okay?  \n[198]Christmas shopping.    \n[199]   \n[200]Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe I'll call ya back. \n[201] \n[202] \n[203]Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right now, but if it's you, Troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you. \n[204]That's $87.50. \n[205]Sorry. Didn't go through. \n[206] \n[207] \n[208]I gotta get back before KMART closes. \n[209]I got nothing for under the tree. \n[210]Don't you people even take Christmas Eve off? \n[211]You could fool me the way they were all lined up at All for a Dollar today. \n[212]From what? \n[213]That's awful not to have Santa Claus-- for the kids, I mean. \n[214]    \n[215]Wait. They're not Chinese. \n[216]What does that mean? \n[217]Well where's that? \n[218]A big difference. \n[219]Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border. \n[220]I wanna know what's in the bag. \n[221]What's in there? \n[222]Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English. \n[223]Just hold on a second. \n[224]I'll take that. What are you doing?! Just count the money and let's go. \n[225]I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them. \n[226] \n[227]Shit! \n[228]I'm not stoppin'. \n[229]Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that. \n[230]-Hi, I'm gonna be a little late. -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. \n[231]-No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye. \n[232] \n[233]  \n[234]It was too heavy. We had to unload it. \n[235]What's the matter with her!? \n[236]What is she saying!? \n[237]It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag. \n[238]I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag. \n[239]If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it- \n[240]I know! I know that. \n[241]    \n[242]  \n[243]    \n[244] \n[245]  \n[246](faintly heard though the \n[247]Come on! \n[248]Tap the bottom of his feet. \n[249]That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born. \n[250]Well, I can't hold it and drive. \n[251]At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up. \n[252]Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold. \n[253]   \n[254]Shit! \n[255]Oh shit. What do I do? \n[256]What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's. \n[257]What if he searches the car. What do we say about- \n[258] \n[259]Did I do something? \n[260]Okay. \n[261]Oh, I didn't know. \n[262]Thanks. \n[263]She looks after my kids when I have to work late. \n[264]Yeah, you, too. \n[265]Just a blown out tail light. \n[266]Yeah. \n[267]   \n[268]We gotta take it in. \n[269]What is it? \n[270]What? Are you sure? \n[271]He was just cold. \n[272]We found him. \n[273] \n[274]He was just cold. \n[275]Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life. \n[276]All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree. \n[277]What? \n[278]Look, I don't have time for that. I can't get deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need one more run to have enough for my double. \n[279]Here. \n[280]Merry Christmas or whatever. \n[281]   \n[282]  \n[283]What's that? \n[284]Where'd you get it? \n[285]Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know. \n[286]Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news. \n[287]Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide. \n[288]Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work. \n[289]What's that smell? \n[290]I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I? \n[291]    \n[292]Yes. \n[293]I haven't gotten the light fixed- \n[294]Sure. \n[295]   \n[296]Yes. \n[297]Not too long. She looks after my kids. \n[298]Really? \n[299]Wow. That's a shock. \n[300]Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved. \n[301]Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas. \n[302]Oh my God. \n[303]Absolutely. \n[304]Thanks. You, too. \n[305]  \n[306]T.J. could you come out here for a minute. \n[307]No. \n[308]Did you have a fire last night? \n[309]You fixed um? \n[310]Did you happen to use the blow torch? \n[311]Look at this. We can't live here anymore! \n[312]No, it was our house. \n[313]Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother. \n[314]Put it down. \n[315]Put it down. \n[316]Put that thing down! \n[317]That was an accident. \n[318]He spent the food money on scratch cards, \n[319]Gimme that thing. \n[320]T.J. come on now. \n[321]He was clean for 23 months. \n[322] \n[323]I know. \n[324]That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket. \n[325]I got money. \n[326]I just want to buy some scratch cards. \n[327] \n[328]He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that damn torch out -- which I told him not to do touch when I wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out- \n[329]There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move. \n[330]I just need one more run to get the double. \n[331]Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay? \n[332]What is it then?! \n[333]Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag? \n[334]You're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby. \n[335]Yeah, but you gotta get him first. \n[336]I'll help you. You can even borrow my gun. \n[337]You should see the inside. \n[338]Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom. \n[339]Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze. \n[340]I'll be back. \n[341]I wanna schedule a delivery. \n[342]It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow. \n[343]Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it. \n[344]Have you ever been there? \n[345]No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked to work in his shed, mostly. \n[346]Can't miss that. \n[347]Okay. We'll take them. \n[348]Just open the trunk. \n[349]Turn around! \n[350]I want the rest. \n[351] \n[352]No. But thanks. \n[353]Put it there. \n[354]He shot me. \n[355] \n[356]Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there! \n[357]Is it there? \n[358]Good. \n[359]I can't. \n[360]How much farther to the reservation? \n[361]What the hell? We're on the reservation. \n[362]Shit! \n[363]Will it hold us? \n[364]I gotta go. \n[365]No. You stay here. \n[366]I thought this was all legal on the reservation. \n[367] \n[368]But, she's a Mohawk. \n[369]Listen, my kids got no one but me. \n[370]At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know? \n[371]It's just a few months, right? \n[372]I got baby stuff in the shed. \n[373]Get a good used single wide with insulation. Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. Ricky's allergic to penicillin. And you can't feed `em Pringles all the time. Okay? \n[374]Okay? \n[375]But you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don't want him to get scared, you know. \n[376]And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean.  Go with her. Okay? \n[377]   \n[378]How long is it for me. You know if I confess? \n[379]Will they get sent back? \n[380]Can I have a cigarette? \n[381]I got somebody. \n[382]A friend. \n[383]But I need to call my kid. \n[384]  \n[385]            \n[386] ", "Eddy": "", "Jimmy": "\n[1]  \n[2]Thunder! SHUT UP!. \n[3]Get back under there! \n[4]He don't like whites, Lila. \n[5]And your late. \n[6]I shouldn't even be dealing with you. \n[7]  \n[8]   \n[9]Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no. \n[10]I don't want any trouble with him, Lila. \n[11]This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino. \n[12]  \n[13]   \n[14]  \n[15]  \n[16]  \n[17]Heat wave! \n[18] \n[19]Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch out for the Mounties and the Surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls. \n[20]Hi Mom. \n[21] \n[22]Hi, Billy. \n[23]Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before.
