[Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie. \n[3]Welcome to the village, William Starks. \n[4]That's too bad. I don't believe in disposable language either -- you know, the small talk, the little talk. Chit. Chat. Useless. The game's something else though. Think about it: What can we trade with each other in the air between us? This... [running his hand through the air] is our court. [Beat, so eager it's sad] I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on. What are you in here for? \n[5]I tried to kill my wife. \n[6]I tried something like 30 times. \n[7]She's bigger than me, and she's stronger than me. And I never planned on doing it. It was always in the heat of the moment. I didn't beat her or anything. Hell, she beat me. But when we'd start fighting, I'd go for the knife. Then she kept threatening to have me put away, and [looking around] she finally did. \n[8]Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean. \n[9]It's a hard one for me, Dr. Lorenson. [Finally turns to face her, grimly] The world around me, it's shrinking. There's not even room for light to make its way in. [Beat] Da-da-bum! Da- da-bum! I feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me, Doc. Only today, he's not carrying flowers. \n[10]What? It's better than fine. \n[11]Of course you can, Doc. William, it was an absolute pleasure.

It means you're sane on some level. \n[18][Beat] How do you know? \n[19]Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think... \n[20]It's gonna be sticky. \n[21]'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women! \n[22]You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something. \n[23]Hey, I brought you some smokes. \n[24]Geez, how's that for a fucking \"thank you\"? \n[25]She left me, I tried to kill her, I tried to kill myself. She was mean, I was weak, I was cruel so she left, I didn't plan it, didn't see it...FINE! I didn't want to see it. I'm in here because they say I have a nervous condition. [Beat] Well, here's my question, who wouldn't be nervous if they really looked at their life? [Beat] Whose life is that good? \n[26]Not this luckless little mammal's. What difference is it to them? [Beat, slows down] You believe what you want to believe. One version is easier than another so you make it your own. \n[27]I'll tell you this though. However nuts I am, I wasn't nuts enough not to know how wrong it was to put a human being in something like that. \n[28][Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3. \n[29]I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this. ", "Dr.": "\n[1]William Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother. A delusion as complex as that can often replace the reality of an incident like this. Officer Harrison'd been shot three times. He was long dead by the time we got there. \n[2]I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome. The medical community is only beginning to gather information about it. \n[3]BETH LORENSON , and DR. GRIES are convened with other STAFF at a routine hospital meeting.

I don't know. You tell me, Doc. You think there's anything wrong with me? \n[12]I don't know. You're not my patient. \n[13]You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating? \n[14]Sure. \n[15]Hold him while I get the tranquilizer. \n[16]Wait...Dr. Becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for? \n[17]Just strap him in for now. \n[18]You ok? \n[19][Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you... \n[20]But... what about Starks? \n[21]Should we be... \n[22]But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that? Leaving him in? [Beat] The medication I'm given him is intended to adjust -- maybe even reset -- his violent proclivities. You know, peel away some of those layers of hate. The Jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen. The grounds and the halls -- where I can't monitor side effects I can't predict -- aren't. But, but...what about... But...but what about the gun? I mean, should he have been firing away like that? [Shaking his head at GRIES] You can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up. [Turning away] There, there's the insurance you're looking for. \n[23]I'm not looking for anything. \n[24]William, can you hear me? \n[25]We never should have done this to him... \n[26]Is he? [Impatiently] Is he dead? \n[27]We're late. \n[28]Maybe it's not such a waste. \n[29]They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for. \n[30]They should just be looking harder. \n[31]Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now. \n[32]I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then. \n[33]No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more. \n[34]Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you. \n[35]Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago. \n[36]Your father was here 12 years ago. I doubt the hospital would have that, if Dr. Becker is still even alive. [Beat, a little suspiciously] Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died? \n[37]Let me just tell her we're here. \n[38][Beat] What do you need me to do? \n[39]I can't take you out of here in your condition... \n[40]No, it hasn't.

[Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was... \n[48][Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? \n[49]Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do. \n[50]Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. \n[51]    \n[52]I know. \n[53]No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them. \n[54]Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker? \n[55]I'm just William's friend. \n[56]Who was Eugene? He was a friend's son.

How did he help? \n[58]How? \n[59]I don't understand. \n[60]Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. \n[61]Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene? \n[62]You think Lorenson kills you? \n[63]Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with. \n[64]Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled. \n[65]Maybe this wasn't such a good idea... \n[66]We were just leaving. \n[67]How long do we have? \n[68]They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed. \n[69]    \n[70]What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy. \n[71]You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't. \n[72]It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it... \n[73]    \n[74]      \n[75]You just scared me, that's all. \n[76]Here, drink this.

But wait, how can that be? \n[88]I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. \n[89][Beat] I don't know. \n[90]What are you doing? \n[91]William! William! \n[92]Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have to come back. \n[93]It's Sunday. \n[94]So? \n[95]William, you're not making sense. \n[96]    \n[97]    \n[98]That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. \n[99]What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket.

[Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was... \n[54][Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? \n[55]Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do. \n[56]Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. \n[57]    \n[58]I know. \n[59]No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them. \n[60]Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker? \n[61]I'm just William's friend. \n[62]Who was Eugene? He was a friend's son. [Beat] Are you familiar with the case? \n[63]Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help? \n[64]How? \n[65]I don't understand. \n[66]Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. \n[67]Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene? \n[68]You think Lorenson kills you? \n[69]Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with. \n[70]Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled. \n[71]Maybe this wasn't such a good idea... \n[72]We were just leaving. \n[73]How long do we have? \n[74]They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed. \n[75]    \n[76]What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy. \n[77]You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't. \n[78]It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it... \n[79]    \n[80]      \n[81]      \n[82]You just scared me, that's all. \n[83]Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going. \n[84]      \n[85]I think this is his house. \n[86]    \n[87]Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired \n[88]They're not here. \n[89][Beat, lost] No. \n[90]Maybe they're out. \n[91]    \n[92]How much time do we have? \n[93]What? What are you thinking? \n[94]Yeah, you're right. But wait, how can that be? \n[95]I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. \n[96][Beat] I don't know. \n[97]What are you doing? \n[98]William! William! \n[99]Maybe he's gone somewhere. He'll have to come back. \n[100]It's Sunday. \n[101]So? \n[102]William, you're not making sense. \n[103]    \n[104]    \n[105]That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. \n[106]What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you. \n[107]Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we? \n[108]To the hospital. \n[109]Claire, I need help. \n[110]Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through. \n[111]Ok. Ssh. Rest. \n[112]No! It won't do any good. [Beat] Please, Claire. They won't understand. \n[113]    \n[114]     \n[115]William, please, honey, wake up. For me. \n[116]Can you hear me? \n[117]I found out about Eugene. The little boy. He's the key. That's who you have to tell her about when you get back there. It's the only way to prove this to her. \n[118]What? \n[119]112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you? \n[120]Then, where are you going? \n[121]    \n[122]I've been ok. \n[123]Ok, I guess. \n[124]Sure. \n[125]Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason... \n[126]Why? \n[127]    \n[128]   \n[129]Hey, wait! \n[130]Ok. \n[131]      \n[132]      \n[133]    \n[134]    \n[135]       \n[136]Hey there. [Beat] You ok? \n[137]You're bleeding pretty bad there. \n[138]It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. \n[139]But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that? \n[140]    \n[141]Sorry, one sec. \n[142]Hey! How are you? [Beat] Thanks. I was just thinking about you, too. \n[143]Listen, I gotta go, mom, 'cause I'm late... but, thanks. Happy New Year to you, too. I'll call you later. [Beat] Ok, bye. \n[144]Sorry about that. It was my mom. \n[145]How you doin'? ", "Starks": "\n[1]I was 25 years old the first time I died... \n[2]I remember there was so much white everywhere. And I felt peace...even though there was war around me. And I felt alive, even though I knew I was dead. \n[3]Can I have one of those? \n[4]I didn't know where my home was. I just knew I didn't want to be there anymore. \n[5]You two ok? \n[6]Jean? Jean, can you hear me? I need you to try to wake up, Jean. \n[7]Your mom take anything before this happened? \n[8][Beat] What's your name? \n[9]Nice to meet you, Jackie. Why don't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a look at your car. \n[10]What do you think of all this snow? \n[11]Hey, can you reach the gas pedal? \n[12]Go ahead, turn it on. Keep pushing it. It works! \n[13]Neither do I, ma'am. I'll be on my way. \n[14]Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel. \n[15]Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification. \n[16][Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are. Hm. \n[17]I think I can remember what's on them. \n[18][Beat] Yes. \n[19]         \n[20][Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What? \n[21]Depends on what you're seeing. \n[22][Beat] You don't believe me, do you? \n[23]       \n[24]Wait. Wait a minute... Please. \n[25]I, I don't belong here. \n[26]Yeah, guess so. How'd you know? \n[27]Don't you go to jail for that? \n[28]Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy. \n[29]I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams. \n[30]You done with your small talk? \n[31]Good. \n[32]    \n[33]      \n[34][Beat] I'm not deaf. \n[35][Beat] Thanks. \n[36]I'm not sure. \n[37]I'm not sure. \n[38]I don't think so. \n[39]I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know. \n[40]Why \"of course\"? \n[41]Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either. \n[42][Beat] I was dropped off. \n[43]No. \n[44]No. [Beat] Not around here. \n[45]Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far. \n[46]I'll manage. \n[47]No, I'm ok. \n[48][Beat] Yeah, I'm fine. \n[49]I'm not gonna hurt you. I know. [Clearing her throat] I'm gonna go take a bath. Make yourself at home. You know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. There's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. And don't snoop, ok? \n[50]Ok. [Beat] My name's William by the way. No, no. Let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, I don't want to meet you. I may want to help you tonight, but I don't want to know you. Honest. \n[51]The best I could do with what was in your fridge. \n[52]I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if... \n[53]Sure. \n[54]Thanks. \n[55]So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing. \n[56]You like it? \n[57]Have you always been a waitress? No. I used to be a nurse. \n[58][Beat] Why'd you stop? \n[59]I don't know, but I think part of it's... \n[60]That I don't really know what's real. \n[61][Beat] Why? \n[62]You don't think that's crazy? \n[63]This is a great song. \n[64]But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember? \n[65]They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split. \n[66]I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either. \n[67]Yeah. [Beat] How about you? \n[68]How? \n[69]I'm sorry. \n[70]That when you stopped being a nurse? Yeah, that's when I stopped being a nurse. I never thought I could stop being one, I wanted it for so long, but... you just can't do it anymore when you lose someone like that. You can't take care of other people. \n[71]Jackie? Jackie? \n[72]What year is it? 2004. \n[73][Beat] I'm William Starks. \n[74][Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me. \n[75]Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it. \n[76]No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital. \n[77]I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you. \n[78][Beat] What? \n[79][Beat] What? \n[80]How? \n[81]I gave you my dog tags. \n[82]How'd he die? \n[83]It's December 25th, 1993 today. \n[84]I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around. \n[85]He's got his gun pointed at a kid. \n[86]Yeah, well, none of this is our fuckin' problem. \n[87]    \n[88]    \n[89]What the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me? \n[90]It's December 26th? \n[91]I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there. \n[92][Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket. \n[93]That wasn't a fucking restraint. \n[94]Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here. \n[95]Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer. \n[96]I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. \n[97]I don't give a shit about your patient! \n[98]We are not birds of a feather. \n[99]    \n[100]How'd he die? \n[101]And if I didn't want to come? \n[102]Because I don't think I'm crazy. \n[103]That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did. \n[104]No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind. \n[105]Since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything? How's your treatment progressing with Dr. Becker? \n[106]Fine. [Beat] Why made you ask? \n[107]Why, what would you do? \n[108]No. I don't want it to. \n[109]Believe me, I know. \n[110]What were you talking about the other day? \n[111]Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods... \n[112]What do you know about the Jacket? \n[113][Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die. \n[114][Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die. \n[115]The Jacket. \n[116]No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days. \n[117]Yeah, it is. \n[118]Why? \n[119]So what am I supposed to do? \n[120]Yeah, Why are you in this ward alone? Where is everyone? There's a state rep visiting so they've moved everyone around. But I've been alone before... \n[121]Where are the other orderlies? \n[122]Ok, listen. I want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you. I'll go get some doctors. \n[123]When I was in the Gulf, the Organization was recruiting the Organized. Is that a fact, Mr. Starks? Because if it's not, it doesn't help Mr. Jensen. \n[124]They recruit only the best, Mr. Jensen. [Beat] I didn't want to have to say this... \n[125]But these people [pointing to the Doctors] know about it. In fact, when Presidents of this country and heads of state leave office, they come here, to Alpine Grove. They're among us right now! [Looking right at Becker] Isn't that right, Dr. Thatcher? And Jensen, I'm proud they picked you. \n[126]They're always ordering us to stay calm, but how can we be calm? \n[127][Looking suddenly directly at Becker] All they do is give orders. That's all they have to do. And no one will ever know. All it comes down to is an order. [Beat] They've got hands everywhere. \n[128]Long live the Organization for the Organized! \n[129]No. \n[130]I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it... \n[131]Why? Step out of the car. \n[132]Ok, sir. I was just asking what for. \n[133]Jesus Christ, what'd you do that for? \n[134]Yeah. \n[135]After I... \n[136]What? \n[137]Do you really believe me? \n[138]Yes. \n[139]I know. \n[140]If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net? \n[141]I didn't kill Officer Harrison. \n[142]How? Did they figure it out after I died? \n[143]His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died? \n[144]What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think. \n[145]What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries? \n[146]He was the only family I remember. I'll see what I can find out about Dr. Becker. And maybe Dr. Lorenson will know something. \n[147]I never knew my father. Did you? \n[148]Why? \n[149]You thought my father was crazy? \n[150]What case? \n[151]Do you know how my father died? I don't know how much I remember but I seem to think it was from a... cut or blow of some sort or another. \n[152]How'd he get it? \n[153]But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was... \n[154]Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea? \n[155]My dad wrote some things down before he died. \n[156]Why would we do that? \n[157]I wouldn't be so sure. Like you said about back then, you might not know everything going on around here. \n[158][Beat] Yeah, it is. It's almost as if your life depended on it. Isn't it? \n[159]Exactly. \n[160][Beat] We will. \n[161]I don't believe a thing she just said. \n[162]I have no idea. \n[163]Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died. \n[164]Why? \n[165][Beat] There's one more thing I want to see. \n[166]This was the room. They used to hang the Jacket there. [Turning to Jackie] This is where it happened. This is the room I'm actually in right now. \n[167]I can show you. It's probably in there. \n[168]Yes, it was. [Softly] My fingers were the only things I could move. [Beat] Dead bodies don't bleed. And they certainly can't claw so hard they dent metal. \n[169]You may have known my father, William Starks. \n[170]He didn't either. I'll be damned. He musta been 12 when he had you. [Beat] You could be his ghost. \n[171]Did you know my father? \n[172]You wouldn't happen to know how he died, would you? No, I don't. I just remember them finding his body. \n[173]You don't know any more, Damon? How'd you know my name? \n[174]My father used to talk about you. \n[175]He said you were a sadistic fuck that belonged in jail. \n[176]That's too bad. \n[177]I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death? \n[178]He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it. \n[179]You know something, Damon? You're like a mule. You're real stubborn. But there's ways of fixin' that. All you need is a good stick. [Beat] Here's your stick. Live with it. \n[180]I don't know. \n[181]How far away is that? \n[182]I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say. Well, doesn't what he did to you make you mad? \n[183]Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days. \n[184]I might not be able to. \n[185]    \n[186]I'll die either way. \n[187]You have no idea what's going on. \n[188]Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place. \n[189]You don't understand. \n[190]This has nothing to do with that. Then what? What? [Beat] I can't guess it. You have to help me. \n[191]...What you do not know is the only thing you know. \n[192][Beat] And what you own is what you do not own... And where you are is where you are not. \n[193]I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember? \n[194][Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket. \n[195]    \n[196]You don't believe me. Well, what year do you think it is now? I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992. Same as every sane person. \n[197]It doesn't look all that different. \n[198]No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from. \n[199]I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life. \n[200]Not everyone in here is crazy, Doc. \n[201]Maybe. Did he tell you he tried to kill his wife? \n[202]Because I don't have time. \n[203]I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it. \n[204]Because of the future. I know what's going to happen. \n[205]And what about your work with Eugene -- the kid? Is that another facet of my delusions? \n[206]You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me. How do you know about Eugene!? You told me. It's like two parts of you talking through me. Look, judging from your reaction, there's no other way I could know about him. \n[207]Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true. \n[208]NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me! \n[209]One's got everything to do with the other. So unless you want my blood on your hands...leave what's between me and Becker between me and Becker. \n[210]      \n[211]Lorenson said your wife left you for another man and that's when you lost it. \n[212]Is it true? \n[213]MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy? \n[214]Becker does? Are you sure? \n[215]Thanks for the cigarettes. You still got a lot of problems, MacKenzie, but you're ok. \n[216]That's too bad. \n[217]They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh? \n[218]Makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine. \n[219]My business? \n[220]Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison. \n[221]And wound up in a better cage. [Beat] But I still want to make a deal. \n[222]See, the deluxe lab animal treatment I've been receiving -- well, I don't think it's worked. I woke up today and realized... [eerily lowering his voice] ...I don't think I'm cured. So really, what was the point? Torture? I think that's still sort of illegal in some states -- though we'll have to check on Vermont. And, how's this for the cherry on top: it seems my physician is a pill-popping freak. [Beat] Last time I checked, that makes some pretty good copy for a lot of these news shows. [Humbly, deftly] \"I don't remember everything they did to me. I just remember the worst parts.\" I think I should be sitting down when I say it, don't you think? \n[223]You sure you know where to find one? \n[224]And what does that mean? \n[225]Becker, how do you sleep at night? \n[226]    \n[227]    \n[228][Weakly] No funny business. \n[229]Me, too. \n[230]You're sure? \n[231]They're not. \n[232]There're no cars on this street. \n[233]I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it? \n[234]Then why isn't there anyone around? \n[235]Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it? \n[236]Look where these people live. \n[237]They've got lives to be grateful for. \n[238][Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is. \n[239]You still go to Church. How's that work? Your God just doesn't notice? That it? [Beat, serious] How you doin', Dr. Becker? \n[240]I don't know, Dr. Becker. Can you? \n[241]I think you know. Your eyes say you do. \n[242]No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing. \n[243]I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you? \n[244]I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know. \n[245]I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there. \n[246]How? \n[247]Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer? \n[248]So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out? \n[249]No, we were patients. \n[250]Who were the others? Nathan Piechowski, Jackson MacGregor, and Ted Casey. [Beat] I didn't ask for you -- for any of you. You were all sent to me. \n[251]You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker. \n[252]I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it? \n[253]No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket. \n[254]The same way you just said I didn't without my ever telling you. [Beat] And that still doesn't excuse what you did. Just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside. [Beat] You've earned your guilt, Becker. \n[255]No, he didn't. \n[256]No one's killing anyone. \n[257]Touch me. I'm okay. \n[258]If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face. \n[259]Where are we going? \n[260]What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker? \n[261]Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her. \n[262]Where are you going? \n[263]Sure. \n[264]Jackie? \n[265]When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address? \n[266]You gotta stop thinking like that. \n[267]Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick. \n[268]I'm William Starks. I'm not his son. And...and the kid you work with. Your friend's son...Eugene... \n[269]How...how do you know? \n[270]I did? \n[271]Who...who kills me? \n[272]Nathan...Piechowski. [Beat] Jackson MacGregor...Ted Casey. [Beat] You didn't cure them. You killed them. \n[273]    \n[274]     \n[275]    \n[276]    \n[277]Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me? \n[278]Can I get some paper and something to write with. \n[279]You still don't believe me, do you? \n[280]No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene... \n[281]No one knows you're working with him so how would I have found out? He's your friend's son, right? \n[282]Listen to me. That's all I ask. \n[283]He's having absence [pronounced \"absance\"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly. \n[284]You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it. \n[285]I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up. \n[286]You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him. \n[287]      \n[288]It worked, didn't it? \n[289]This is really happening, isn't it? \n[290][Beat] Thank you. \n[291]I need to get this letter to someone. \n[292]And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. \n[293]Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs. \n[294]You know how to get there? \n[295]Good. \n[296]No, I'll be ok. \n[297]Hi. Hey. [Beat] I remember you. \n[298]I remember you, too. \n[299]Jackie, how have you been? \n[300]Good. How's your mom? \n[301]Do you think I could see her? \n[302]Hey, Jean. Nice to see you. \n[303]You could say that. \n[304]I can't stay long. [Motioning to Lorenson] That's my doctor and I gotta get back to the hospital. Everything I want to say is in this letter. [Beat] You can check as much of it as you can. \n[305]I won't be around when you read it...but I hope you believe it. It'd be a real shame if you didn't. \n[306][Beat] I should be on my way. \n[307]Bye, Jackie. \n[308]Happy New Year to both of you. \n[309][Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie. \n[310]I was 25 years old the first time I died. It didn't end anything though. [Beat] Sometimes I think we live through things only to be able to tell them, to bear witness, to say this happened. \n[311]And it wasn't to someone else. It was to me. And I lived despite it. Sometimes I think we live to beat the odds. And sometimes I agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death. That it can all end, even when you least want it to. \n[312]I'm telling you my story because it's the only way I can try to help your daughter, and you, have a better one of your own. \n[313]It's scary...and lucky...how much we can forget. Scary because we think the past gives us our bearing, and lucky because in those moments I'm talking about, you realize it doesn't. And it never had to. \n[314]I am not a crazy man, even though they mistook me for one. I live in the same world as the rest of you. Only I saw more of it. \n[315]    \n[316]And the seeing is the only way you can hear what the truth around you is saying: you can always start believing in things you don't already believing in. And, while you're alive, it's never too late. \n[317]I promise you, Jean. No matter how bad the days and things around you look, they look better awake than they do asleep. I can offer you some proof: when you die, there's only one thing you want to have happen...sometimes so badly it comes true, I guess. [Beat] You want to come back. \n[318]          \n[319]I think so. \n[320]I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive. Yes, you are alive. But, listen, it's New Year's Day. You're not going to get a cab. Especially not here. And you're gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer. I'm on my way back to my shift at the hospital... \n[321]You work there? Yeah, I'm a nurse. Why don't you let me give you a ride... \n[322]Thanks. \n[323]Nothin' to worry about there. \n[324]I'm doing fine.

You're two fucking freaks is what you are. Well, no shit, Einstein. What do you think we're doing in this place? \n[9]I want the two of you to shut the fuck up and eat your food.
