And is there any kind of deposit?.. Okay. \n[2]I'll call you back. Thanks. \n[3]What did you tell me you were going to do when things got tight? \n[4]Did you? \n[5]The lady from student housing. We talked about it. Remember? \n[6]Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me. \n[7]Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it. \n[8]You're exhausted. When you have a stroke I'm going to abandon you on a park bench. \n[9]This drive is too long. \n[10]You're already bothering me. \n[11]What are you, kidding me? \n[12]Anonymous. It's Greek. It means \"you don't have a shot\". \n[13]Subtle. \n[14]Ah. \n[15]Who else do you plan on asking? \n[16]I'm nineteen. \n[17]I don't date sociology majors... they're a rowdy bunch. \n[18]About what? \n[19]I'm Ally. \n[20]   \n[21]Dad, we've seen freaking Erin Brockovich twice already. You always cry. \n[22]It's embarrassing. \n[23]Hello? \n[24]Hi. \n[25]No... I...I was just... \n[26]No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm just...getting dressed. \n[27]And I'm going to meet you at the place at..what time again? \n[28]Right...yes. Eight...okay. \n[29]Shit. \n[30]I'm going out. \n[31]Well, you're a trained investigator. \n[32]A boy from school. \n[33]I wasn't asking for permission. \n[34]Thanks. \n[35]Dad. \n[36] \n[37]Great, I'll have that. A glass of skim milk. Then the mussels, please. \n[38]I have my dessert first. \n[39]I just don't see the point in waiting for something I know I want and am going to have. What if I die eating my mussels? \n[40]It's possible. If an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, I'd die without having eaten the thing I wanted most. \n[41]Fine. I'll tell you what, you guarantee me. Swear to me on your eternal soul that I'll make it through my entr\u00e9e. And I'll wait. \n[42]Before you answer, keep in mind, if I die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence. My last wish. Are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point? \n[43]Don't worry. I'll share. \n[44]Really? \n[45]I had a nice time. \n[46]Apparently. \n[47]Can't we just stroll while I feed you ice cream with fireworks in the background? \n[48]Who, the attendant? \n[49]I don't know what you're smiling about. \n[50]Paying off the attendant is not winning... It's cheating. \n[51]Aha. By the way, what happened to your eye? \n[52]How butch. \n[53]Okay, Captain Morgan... \n[54]I'll take a cab. \n[55]Thanks. \n[56]Not tonight. Not never... just... not tonight. \n[57]Hey! Turn on the meter. \n[58]You're really weird. \n[59] \n[60]I don't do coasters till the third date. \n[61]Is that you? \n[62]He looks like you... or you look like him. Does he play around here? \n[63]Do you play? \n[64]If I asked anybody? \n[65]So what talents do you actually have? \n[66]There's a lot of money in that. \n[67]What's that? \n[68]So what kind of grade did you end up with from Vogelstein? \n[69]Oh. And The Strand is not a significant career choice. \n[70]At the rate you're going, dish washing is going to be your life's vocation. I can say I knew you when. \n[71]This is the playful, you get me all wet part? Right? \n[72]It is cheap. I've seen this scene a hundred times. \n[73]You know what never happens in this scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go- to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really care-about-his-job? \n[74]This. \n[75]No, that usually never happens. \n[76]Never. Your middle name is Keats? Your parents are pretentious as hell. \n[77]I'd rather eat monkeys. \n[78]Victory at all costs. \n[79]You should quit anyway. \n[80]Is that a tattoo? Let me see. \n[81]Please. It's very bad ass. All that ritualistic scarring. \n[82]I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't realize. \n[83]When? \n[84]I thought he was a musician. \n[85]Mine too. \n[86]Oh! You're the assaholic! \n[87]I can't, I would, I'd love to, but I've gotta get home, my dad's waiting up. \n[88] \n[89]Tyler... \n[90]I, need, you... to call... my dad. \n[91]  \n[92]...oh God oh God oh God oh God... \n[93]...I'm sorry. I fell asleep... \n[94]I forgot to charge it. \n[95]That's mine. From my desk. \n[96]How could you? \n[97]How could you go through my stuff like I'm a suspect? \n[98]What is the matter with you, Dad? You have no respect for me and the way I'm feeling, my privacy. We talked about this! You're totally paranoid... \n[99]You don't do anything. You don't go anywhere except work. You have no life. \n[100]Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a date! \n[101]So do I. \n[102]Dad... \n[103]\n[104]I didn't know where else to go. \n[105]Hey... \n[106]Where did you go? \n[107]Why? \n[108]New York is full of coffee shops. \n[109]Oh. So you go there to write? To him? \n[110]My mom was murdered eight years ago. The same year your brother died. \n[111]You don't need to say anything, I know you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry, you know? \n[112]It's just, I need you to know that, my dad, he's not an evil guy. \n[113]I don't want you to think that because I'm here he's some kind of belligerent psychotic, he's not...I don't know, it's just recently, he seems really... \n[114]Wounded? Our house is like the recovery room, or the critical care unit or something. \n[115]I don't feel like that, though. I feel like I'm getting stronger and like I'm leaving him behind to swim in it all by himself. \n[116]Hi. Nice to meet you. \n[117]Come on, Aidan. \n[118]Nice to meet you, Diane. \n[119]That was weird. I assume most moms don't smoke weed in front of their son's...um \n[120]You know, you're a poet. \n[121]It's not like he had a choice. She ambushed us. \n[122]Ha ha. \n[123]Did it ever occur to you that that's kind of weird? \n[124]You're the second member of this family I've washed dishes with. \n[125]Wow. \n[126]May I? \n[127]That's exactly him. It's like the cigarette is the last Coca Cola in the desert. \n[128]I can't believe he smokes in front of you. \n[129]You know when I was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and I would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but The Met was always her favorite. \n[130]So... I heard you've got an art exhibit coming up. \n[131]Was it that obvious? But only if you're OK with it. I don't want to impose and I'll completely understand if you don't want some random girl there. \n[132]You like? \n[133]You just want to skip dinner. I got you a tie. \n[134]You're learning. \n[135] \n[136]I'm fine, thank you. \n[137]Yes. But with an area of focused responsibility. It's easier to find a job that way. \n[138]Criminal Justice. \n[139]When I was little I wanted to play first base for the Mets. I don't think it's any harder than that. \n[140] \n[141]Shane Spencer. \n[142]Nick Johnson. \n[143]Twenty-two years. \n[144]It's OK. \n[145]It's just a call. He held out 'til dessert. \n[146]She passed away when I was eleven. \n[147]She was murdered. I was there. \n[148] \n[149]I don't know. \n[150]Yup. Here I am. \n[151]I think he's lovely. \n[152]Where are you going? \n[153]Now? \n[154]Oh my God. \n[155]Okay. \n[156]It's okay. \n[157] \n[158] \n[159]You're such a romantic. \n[160]Excuse me? \n[161]White girl. \n[162]Shut up. Black girl. \n[163]Asian. \n[164]Latina. \n[165]A Latin girl actually slept with you? What's her name? She's out of the club. \n[166]Eskimo. \n[167]No way! \n[168]You slept with an Eskimo? \n[169]I don't believe you. \n[170]Prove it. Ten bucks. \n[171]The minute we get off this train. \n[172]Tyler, are you coming? \n[173]Tyler Keats Roth! \n[174]He banged an Inuit! She's really nice. And smart. I don't get it. \n[175]What's going on? \n[176] \n[177]I hate him! \n[178]I don't understand. \n[179]I'm going to be sick. \n[180]Do you realize what you've done? \n[181]Did you think I would never find out? I mean, think about it. I had to find out eventually. You set it up that way. \n[182]No. That's exactly what you meant to do. \n[183]Prick. \n[184]You know you're not supposed to use that on non-stick pans... \n[185]It takes off the teflon. \n[186]You should let it soak. \n[187]I'm going upstairs. \n[188]Who is it Dad? \n[189]It's OK... \n[190]Really. \n[191]What do you want? \n[192]And... \n[193]Dad... \n[194]He lied to me. \n[195]He'd like to think he is. \n[196]I don't care. \n[197]It's not worth much. You made everything between us a lie. \n[198]Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to just forgive you? \n[199]Using the little sister is dirty pool. \n[200]Maybe. \n[201]Hmmm. \n[202] \n[203]Say hi to your dad for me. \n[204] ", "Craig": "\n[1]Cut those two loose. \n[2]Anything in here that's going to stab me, Einstein? \n[3]Nice. You like to get high and hit women? \n[4]How about you two? \n[5]Shut up, genius. \n[6]Alright. That's it. Everybody goes downtown. \n[7]What are you still doing here? \n[8]Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you think I give a shit? \n[9]It's a great relief to me, Mr. Roth, to know that you're on top of the situation. Now go the fuck home. \n[10]  \n[11]Breathe. \n[12]I did. I'm breathing right now. Who was that? \n[13]Sure. \n[14]I'll drive you. \n[15]   \n[16]Don't be mad... \n[17]I do not. \n[18]    \n[19]I can see that. \n[20]Who are you going with? \n[21]Okay. \n[22]  \n[23]Should I wait up? \n[24]I know Ally's a good kid, Leo. \n[25]  \n[26]...She was supposed to be back. She's not back ... call Ted Proferes ... and what's his face in the 9th...and call me back. Just do it, Leo! \n[27]  \n[28]You turned your phone off. \n[29]You were gone all night. I was trying to get some information. \n[30]Then stop acting like one. \n[31]You watch your mouth! \n[32]My life is right here! In this house. The same place as yours. But you're spitting all over it. \n[33]I smell alcohol... \n[34]\n[35]Ally! \n[36]Tell me something, Matthews, do you like paperwork? \n[37]Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork. But paperwork keeps our ship afloat. Paperwork makes it possible for me to keep track of all the scumbags. But I can't do that if newbies like you are incapable of remembering standard filing... \n[38]...What? \n[39]What? \n[40]What friends? \n[41]That's all? \n[42]No. \n[43]Leo, no. Stop. \n[44]    \n[45]  \n[46]Where is she? \n[47]Where's my daughter? \n[48]Does she know? \n[49]I didn't think so. I figured you'd probably leave that up to me when you're done with her. \n[50]That's true, Tyler Roth, son of Charles and Diane. Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased, suicide by hanging. You're kinda lost, aren't you? Taking a little vacation in coach before finding your way back to first class? \n[51]Get a fucking dead bolt. \n[52]  \n[53]Okay. \n[54]   \n[55]You think I don't remember you? \n[56]Thanks for stopping by. ", "Caroline": "\n[1]You smell like Listerine and beer. \n[2] \n[3]Tyler, did I tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait? \n[4]...She was very impressed. She said I captured a moment like a young James Whistler. \n[5]I would be the youngest one, ever, practically... \n[6]I'm okay. \n[7]I'll stay with mom. \n[8]Kay. \n[9] \n[10]You promised you'd quit... \n[11]You're gonna get emphysema and then you're gonna have to drag an oxygen tank with you everywhere... \n[12]Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the bathroom. \n[13]Why do you think Dad doesn't wanna...like, listen to me? \n[14]So? You can love someone and not want to spend any time with them. \n[15]Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at Christmas, last year, she wouldn't let Les leave them in a room together 'cause she said there would be a \"yule tide homicide.\" \n[16]Duh. \n[17]Michael used to drink. \n[18]You're 21. \n[19]What happened to your face? \n[20]You're so retarded. \n[21]Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where are we meeting mom? \n[22]I just...they think I'm weird. Sometimes I sort of space out. \n[23]Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle Fleischman had to snap her fingers at me a lot today. And everybody laughed and they all think I'm a freak of nature. \n[24]What are you going to tell mom about your face? \n[25]Finally. \n[26]They have me in this art program summer thing at Pratt... \n[27]It's very prestigious due to my artistic greatness. \n[28]There's, like, a thing... \n[29] \n[30]You're so retarded. Mom's been hyperventilating with joy. \n[31]\"Really supportive\"! \n[32]Your school's over, right? \n[33]Yup. What are we going to do for your birthday? \n[34]Can we have a party? \n[35]A little one? At Mom's? With Aidan. I'll make Mom behave. No crying. \n[36]Make a wish. \n[37]Retarded. Tyler? \n[38]\"One, two. three. One, two, three\" \n[39]  \n[40]Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable. \n[41]Mine too. The Met is one of my favorite places in the world. \n[42] \n[43]You're not random... you're Tyler's girlfriend. \n[44]   \n[45]    \n[46] \n[47]Time. \n[48]Mine. \n[49]Gross. Gross.

That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour. \n[9]Tell me about it. \n[10]I understand. You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail \n[11]She didn't say. \n[12]  \n[13]What? \n[14]Okay. \n[15]Tyler, you're on speakerphone. \n[16]What? There are people here. You'll have to speak up. \n[17]What about it? \n[18]Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to dinner first. Alright?...

You don't drink, right? \n[28]So why would anyone wanna avoid you? \n[29]Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21. All 21 year olds drink because it's new and exciting.

So, just take a good long look. And tell me what you think? \n[92]No one here. The parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties. \n[93]In their late teens. Well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and I've run out of those big foam fingers, so I was thinking maybe I could take you out some night? \n[94]Or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation. \n[95]Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm undecided. \n[96]Everything. \n[97]Hey. It's Tyler. \n[98]You're going to stand me up. I can feel it in my bones. I'll be devastated. \n[99]You were just sitting around in your pajamas watching T.V. \n[100]Eight. \n[101]Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks. \n[102]Is this a political statement? A medical condition? \n[103]Is that probable? \n[104]But the odds are, I mean... \n[105]You had a nice time or you're having a nice time? \n[106]Because if you're having one, why rush to end it? \n[107]Did I tell you I'm Caucasian? \n[108]No. If I stop, he wins. \n[109]No, the frigging Giant Panda. \n[110]I won. \n[111]I just paid a premium to cut out the middle man. That's innovation. That's free market enterprising. That's what made America great. \n[112]Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight. \n[113]I know. I'm practically a pirate. \n[114] \n[115]I'll walk you to the train. \n[116]So dessert before dinner for fear of death by rogue asteroid... yes. Kissing guy you're obviously attracted to before driving off into the unknown New York night... no. \n[117]Happy end of sixth grade! \n[118]I heard. \n[119]Don't pretend. I know you're proud. You should be. \n[120]A thing? \n[121]Let me check my book. Abso-freaking- lutely. I'm camping out. I'm sleeping there the night before. \n[122]Good. I'm sure Les was... \n[123]\"Really supportive\"! \n[124]Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les get the beach house again? \n[125]Nothing. \n[126]No. \n[127]Like that's possible. \n[128]I know. But we have coasters. \n[129]That's Michael. My brother. \n[130]Not any more. \n[131]It depends who you ask. \n[132]They'd say no. I try but it turns out you need talent. \n[133]Falconry. I come from a long line of falconers. \n[134]Well there is one thing... \n[135]Our appetizer. \n[136]It used to say \"In Case Of Asteroid\" but I took a shower and Aidan got high. \n[137]I don't actually get grades. \n[138]I'm not technically enrolled. I worked out an auditing thing. \n[139]I like the books. \n[140]You don't have to help me, you know. \n[141] \n[142]I'm sorry. I didn't... \n[143]Apologize. \n[144]Apologize. \n[145]I surrender! Oh my God, you're relentless. \n[146]Now... I'm furious. \n[147]Really? Why? Are cigarettes like bad for you or something? \n[148]It's not really... \n[149]He killed himself. \n[150]When he was 21. He had just started working for my father. \n[151]He was. But he wasn't making a living doing music and my father's a very compelling guy. \n[152]You're not Irish. \n[153]Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally. \n[154] \n[155]Oh. OK. Sure. \n[156]Your phone's dead. Just tell me the number and I'll call him... \n[157]Ally? Ally? \n[158]  \n[159]You were the one dumping Jello shots down her throat. You almost killed her. \n[160]Penance. I have to get to work. \n[161]She's pretty shaken up. \n[162]We've really got to fix that dead bolt. \n[163]Don't be. You think she'll sleep? \n[164]I told her she could stay here... Are you alright with that? \n[165]You're up. \n[166]Can I get you anything? \n[167]I'll be out here if you need me. \n[168]     \n[169]It's not so far. I can't believe you still get his coffee... three sugars, no milk? \n[170]Not today. \n[171]Hey... \n[172]Downtown. \n[173]There's a coffee shop. I brought you a Bialy. \n[174]This one was our place... Michael's and mine. We had breakfast there all the time ... Maybe not as many times as I think we did. But enough times. Anyway we ate there that morning. It was the last place I saw him. \n[175]Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I guess I wanted to tell him about you. \n[176]Hey mom. \n[177]It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally, this is my mom, Diane. \n[178]Sit down, Mom. Can I get you something? \n[179]I wish she'd told me. It was a unilateral Caroline decision. Will you make sausage and peppers? \n[180]I'll get him there. \n[181]I'll get him there, mom. \n[182]Yes. \n[183] \n[184]It's about Caroline's show. Are you planning on attending? \n[185]Caroline's show. \n[186] \n[187]Dinner? That's not... \n[188]\"One, two. three. One, two, three\" \n[189]Let's just skip dinner and I'll tell you how great you look in like eighteen different languages. \n[190]I was going to make a joke about how I'm not prepared for the commitment of exchanging accessories and how neck wear especially is a slippery slope, but I should probably shut up and say thank you. \n[191]Have you ever been here? \n[192]He's allowed to stand me up. But he's not allowed to stand you up. Or my sister. \n[193]I'll have a whiskey. \n[194]This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my father, Charles Roth. \n[195]Dad's a Yankee fan. It has something to do with the payroll. \n[196]Blind familial allegiance. I didn't know what overpriced, overfed, fat bastards they were. \n[197] \n[198]Roger Clemens. \n[199]Why are you saying this now? \n[200]God. \n[201]Don't say it. \n[202]You have somewhere else to be, Dad. \n[203]I don't believe you. \n[204]It's not good enough. \n[205]Ally...? \n[206]I have something I've got to do. \n[207]Are you capable of taking care of yourself for an hour? Do you need me here every minute, or what? \n[208]She drew you a picture. \n[209]You have a daughter who sincerely believes you don't like her. \n[210]Don't you at least want to know her? She's telling you something, Dad. She's communicating. Why aren't you riveted? Why isn't this the most important thing? At least for one night of your life? \n[211]You, Mr. Roth. \n[212]And...? \n[213]Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't either. Where would she have learned it? \n[214]That does not mean you're allowed to shatter it whenever there's something better to do. \n[215]You didn't find him. I found him. And you're so tragically blind, the rest of your children are going to hang themselves on your watch. \n[216]   \n[217]Whose was that anyway? \n[218]What? \n[219]That is the stupidest thing you've ever said, including that time with the bong in the emergency room. \n[220]No way! \n[221]You went to the library? \n[222]I'll skip this particular bloodbath, thank you. \n[223]   \n[224]bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum... \n[225]What are you doing in my house? \n[226]She's not here now. She's at the library. \n[227]No. \n[228]I'm not going anywhere. \n[229]I'm the one she came to when you used her face as a punching bag. \n[230]She needs you. \n[231]Your dad was here. \n[232]When I got home. \n[233]There's more. \n[234]He knows me. Before I met you. He arrested me and Aidan. He gave me that gash over my eye. \n[235]I mouthed off to him. He ... responded. Then Aidan saw you guys together at school. \n[236]Aidan suggested...I...introduced myself to you. \n[237]Ally... \n[238]Hey. \n[239]Don't do that. What are you doing? \n[240]Yeah. \n[241]But it doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to hurt you, \n[242]  \n[243] \n[244]Last one ever. I swear. \n[245]I know you're not here for me but, thank you for being here. \n[246]For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. \n[247]I'm sorry. \n[248]She's sleeping. \n[249] \n[250]I didn't call you. \n[251]Thank you for bailing me out. \n[252] \n[253]   \n[254] \n[255]I'll be back in an hour. I have to stop by my dad's office. \n[256]Whichever tastes better a la mode. \n[257]If I said I love you... what would you say? \n[258]I love you too. \n[259]Are you canceling all together or are you just running late? \n[260]I'm already here. \n[261]Take your time. I'll just wait in your office. \n[262]That's okay. \n[263]Janine in? \n[264]She getting me any? Just kidding. \n[265]   \n[266]Did you know about this? \n[267]Twenty-nine last May. \n[268]May 18, 1993. \n[269]It's okay. \n[270]Whatever you do in life will be insignificant but it is very important that you do it because... \n[271]It's a good bet... \n[272]Nobody else will... \n[273]Michael... \n[274]Someone's been trying to tell me something. \n[275]Maybe it's you... \n[276]  \n[277]This girl! Ally! Her life, even the nightmare parts seeped into me and I swear to God I can hear you better. \n[278]What's that about? I've always been the worst listener. \n[279] \n[280]Someone comes into your life... \n[281]June 17, 1978 September 11, 2001 \n[282]And half of you says \"Danger! Stay in your cave! You're nowhere near ready!\" \n[283]And the other half -- and this is the part I think is you -- \n[284]Says \"Go get her! Immediately! Make her yours forever!\" \n[285]I'm working on the forever part. \n[286]I'm going to have to step up my game. But I'm glad I listened. \n[287]I love you. \n[288]Don't be a stranger.

It's the one-night-stand travel pack for women. We throw in some make-up, toiletries, cell phone charger, cab numbers. Retail it at S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.  \n[5]Hey one-night-stands happen... It's a part of life... like stubbing your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a corner and bend back your pinky toe, other times you wake up in a freshman dorm wearing a field hockey tee shirt wondering why your balls smell like cinnamon...  \n[6]Don't underestimate the novelty gift market. Think about it... instead of giving that token slutty friend a ten-inch purple dildo for her birthday, you hook her up with \"The SLUT.\" Everyone has a laugh and the implication that she'll probably use it someday remains.
