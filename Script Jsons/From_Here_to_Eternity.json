You've got a right to take your case to the Inspector General. Any soldier has, even a plain dogface. \n[5]Listen, Prew. I guess I ought not to tell you but --. Warden hasn't had you on KP much lately, has he? \n[6]Well -- I was working in the Orderly Room this afternoon and I heard the Captain telling Warden you're to pull KP every weekend from now on. You know what that means -- you can' t even go into \n[7]Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. Prew sits on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees, chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board. Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy bar. \n[8]It's on right now. At Headquarters. \n[9]Maybe he won't get it. All he did was get drunk and run wild. That's a soldier's nature. It's almost his sacred duty once in a while. \n[10]listening, his face also betraying emotions normally concealed. \n[11]The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field! It's the Japs! They're bombing Wheeler Field! The Japs! It's the Japs! I saw the red circles on the wings! \n[12]as the Jap plane flashes by close above him. The stones in the pavement pop up.

She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. \n[2]as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering. \n[3]Good morning, Sergeant. \n[4]I'm looking for my husband. \n[5]Oh. Of course, He was to have left some things for me. That he was to have purchased. Do you know anything about them? \n[6]No, thanks, Sergeant. \n[7]He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient. \n[8]What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant? \n[9]I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant. 15. \n[10]  \n[11]It doesn't matter. \n[12]Yes? What did the General have to say? \n[13]If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion. \n[14]I went over there this morning looking for you. \n[15] \n[16]Dana. Give me credit for a few brains. \n[17]Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her face. She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb. \n[18]What right? \n[19]That makes it all right, I suppose! \n[20]You know I hate to talk about it! \n[21]You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom. \n[22]Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet. \n[23]If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here. \n[24] \n[25]I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink. \n[26] \n[27] \n[28]You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time. \n[29]You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant? \n[30](goes to sink, picks up \n[31]That's what I like about you, Sergeant. You have confidence. It's also what I dislike about you. \n[32]Honesty? How did you acquire such an old-fashioned virtue? \n[33]Well, he's clever as well as virile. \n[34]Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant. \n[35]Not if I can help it. \n[36]What are you doing? \n[37] \n[38]Maybe... why not? \n[39]You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant. \n[40]Maybe. 31. \n[41]Why, hello. I didn't think you were coming. \n[42]No, I guess you're not. But then I came a little early. I must have been overanxious. You weren't overanxious though, were you? You got here right on the dot. \n[43]You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting. \n[44]No, but I've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes. 48. \n[45]Well, I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving. \n[46]You probably think I'm a tramp, don't you? \n[47]Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant. If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so. \n[48]On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress. \n[49]I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk. \n[50]I love the way you laugh. \n[51]Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really... \n[52]No. Nobody. \n[53]Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been? \n[54]Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you? \n[55]Then I guess you won't find out, will you? \n[56]What's the matter? What are you hinting at? \n[57]I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot. \n[58]You must be crazy -- ! \n[59]I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different -- \n[60]Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story. \n[61]You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male. \n[62]All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you. 58. \n[63]I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone....  I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens. \n[64]Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs. 59. \n[65]He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine. \n[66]And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him. \n[67]You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again. \n[68]All right. I'm listening. 60. \n[69]I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either. \n[70]her face lit by the flames. She watches the dancing breathlessly. \n[71]astonished and thrilled at Warden's ability. \n[72]as the spectators and dancers shout their applause. Warden comes up to Karen and puts the gardenia in her hair. Karen is glowing, tingling. \n[73]You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that? \n[74]The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. They survey the emptiness. The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes over one of the dying fires. She speaks to Warden in Hawaiian. He answers her in the native tongue. The fat woman stares, shrugs, goes off. \n[75]What did she say? \n[76]Home... A beach, a car, a park... \n[77]It can't go on like this much longer, Milt. \n[78](bucking up courage; \n[79]You've got to become an officer. \n[80]You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then -- \n[81]Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you. \n[82]That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it? \n[83]You can't be certain of that -- \n[84]  \n[85]You just don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me -- \n[86]I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first -- \n[87]And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after. \n[88]Neither have I. \n[89] \n[90] \n[91]at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen. Holmes is a mixture of petulance, anger and frustration. He doesn't touch his food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee. \n[92]I'm afraid I'm not going to tell you. \n[93]I'm not going to hide anything. I'm just not going to tell you. 102. \n[94]I don't think it's any of your business who he is. \n[95]Not very nice. But then there's the compensation of knowing you'll have to live with me the rest of your life. \n[96] \n[97]Done all what? \n[98]I don't know. Why? \n[99] \n[100]It's a lovely day out. I think I'll go for a walk. \n[101]I wonder which is hurt more -- your pride or your curiosity? \n[102] \n[103] \n[104] \n[105] \n[106]He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is strangled, almost hysterical. \n[107]reacting; she is surprised, a little afraid of her own emotion. The outcry, so lost, so despairing, moves her. She is sorry for him. \n[108] \n[109]... I guess I felt it that night I asked you to become an officer. When you didn't say yes right away. 134. \n[110]I guess I knew deep down you wouldn't do it. But --  It seemed such a simple plan for us... \n[111]I guess that's the trouble with Dana... He's always tried to be something he isn't. Poor Dana... I don't think he ever needed me until now.  Well, here we are saying goodbye. And talking about two other people. \n[112]I'm going back with him, Milt. There's something in being needed. It isn't love. But it's something. 135. \n[113] \n[114]No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you any more. I just want to remember you. And you to remember me. \n[115]She is looking back at the city. Around her neck is a garland of leis. \n[116] \n[117]She turns and CAMERA PANS to INCLUDE Alma in shot, standing beside Karen. She is dressed in black, quite severely. \n[118] \n[119]There's a legend. If they float in toward shore, you'll come back some day. If they float out to sea, you won't. \n[120]Oh, I am sorry. \n[121](tossing the last of leis \n[122]Who? ", "Holmes": "\n[1]At ease. Good morning, men. Anything special this morning, Sergeant Warden? I've only a few minutes. \n[2]Oh, yes. Bring him in. 5. \n[3]At ease. (takes papers out of drawer, glances through \n[4]Plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. But he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. I don't know what you've been used to in the Bugle Corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. What kind of trouble were you in over there? 6. \n[5]What made you transfer out, then? \n[6]Oh. I see... \n[7]Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant? \n[8]I've got a mighty sour Company Bugler here... but I suppose you wouldn't want that job. \n[9] \n[10]8. \n[11]  \n[12]Quit fighting? When? What for? \n[13]Yes, it's too bad about that. I can understand how you feel. But those things happen in this game. A man has got to accept that possibility when he fights. \n[14]  \n[15]it this way. What if all fighters felt like that? \n[16]Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt? \n[17]You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home. \n[18]It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is. \n[19]Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant? 10. \n[20]You make it out. Is that all? \n[21]Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back. \n[22]as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. \n[23]I'm sorry I'm so late. And about dinner, I -- \n[24]-- I got tied up with General Slater. Bumped into him at the Officers' Club. \n[25]Success, he said. Success in war, success in peacetime... And not a word about my promotion... There are times I think the Old Man's just waiting to ship me down...  I've had a bad day all around... 16. \n[26]started right off this morning... trouble with a new man... \n[27] \n[28]Now what does that mean? \n[29]How many, times do I have to tell you I haven't any other women before you'll believe me? \n[30]If it were so, don't you think I'd admit it? The way things are between us now? What right have you to always be accusing me? \n[31]That again. How long will it be, I wonder, before I'm allowed to live that down? After eight years, how many times do I have to tell you It Was An Accident? \n[32]I didn't say that. I know what it's done to you, but -- \n[33]It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on his trench coat. He wears a happy smile. \n[34]I won't be back in time to take Retreat.  Or Reveille either, probably. \n[35](strides back and forth; \n[36](bending over, tying \n[37]You ought to get out more yourself, Warden. \n[38]Well, I'm going. \n[39]I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant. \n[40] \n[41] \n[42]The men are grouped around Holmes. He is pressing hard to pretend equanimity. The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but determined. \n[43]-- this man Prewitt's been here over a month now. I expected you mend have him around before this. \n[44]Maybe he needs a good dose of The Treatment. \n[45]You understand. I don't want any rough stuff. 32. \n[46]But we all know good athletes make good leaders. And good leaders -- \n[47]-- and just see you don't drink all this up in one place. \n[48]Have you given any thought to the boxing team recently, Prewitt? \n[49]What's this man's pay? \n[50]What's the matter with you, Prewitt? You know better than to talk back to a non-commissioned officer. \n[51]I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology. \n[52] \n[53]I take it you're ready to apologize to Sergeant Galovitch now. \n[54]Take him back up there again, Galovitch. He hasn't had enough yet. \n[55]Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face. \n[56]Holmes slams his fist on his desk. \n[57]1 know that kind of man! He's an againster. A bitter-ender. You can't be decent to a man like that. You have to tame him, like an animal! Warden, I want you to prepare court martial papers. Insubordination and insolence to an officer. \n[58]Why? Do you see any other way of breaking him? 67. \n[59]All right, all right. But throw the book at him. \n[60] \n[61] \n[62]-- I've known about it for a long time! I've sensed it. And I'm not going to ignore it any longer! I want to know where you met him and just who he is. \n[63]at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen. Holmes is a mixture of petulance, anger and frustration. He doesn't touch his food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee. \n[64]You can't keep a thing like this \n[65]One thing I know. I know it's a civilian. You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man. \n[66]It is my business! I'm your husband! What do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion? So if you're thinking of a divorce, you can forget it! \n[67]Now -- how does it feel to know you'll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life? \n[68]You don't know how a man feels about a thing like this. It breaks a man all up -- inside. \n[69]It's -- it's just not the same. 103. \n[70]Why do you think I've done all I have...? \n[71]Tried to be a Company Commander when I hate it, worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad, tagged after the General whenever I could. \n[72]Why, for you and for me. For our home, that's why. \n[73]wretched, completely at a loss. He stares into space, then looks down at his food, picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat. \n[74]Warden is at his desk filling out an application blank. Holmes is glancing over his shoulder.. \n[75]I'll be glad to recommend you, Warden. You've got service, experience, grade. You'll make an excellent officer. \n[76]At ease, Sergeant. What's the matter? \n[77]There's no rush. I'll take care of it. \n[78] \n[79]What started this? \n[80]You won't disobey any more orders in my Company, Prewitt. Warden saved you from a court martial once but he won't this time -- \n[81] \n[82]That's all. Break it off. Let's get back to our jobs. (to Prew and Galovitch; \n[83]The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office. Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report. \n[84]I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true. \n[85]If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way... \n[86]He confronts her, waving a sheet of stationery. His voice is strangled, almost hysterical. \n[87]--- that's right, it's a letter of resignations I'm through! I've already been relieved! So you can begin packing. We're sailing for the States next week! 131. \n[88]Where has it gone, Karen? What happened to it? The gay, cheerful life we were going to have, you and I...? What happened to me...? The proud, dashing officer was going to be. The leader of men?... I've known all along how the men felt about me. They despised me... What's happened? I don't remember losing anything... Where has it all gone? \n[89] \n[90]Karen -- you're coming back with me, aren't you...? ", "Angelo": "", "Maggio": "\n[1]Prew...? \n[2]You quit the Bugle Corps...? 2. \n[3]To here...? \n[4]You made a bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to Custer. \n[5]The Captain ain't in yet. \n[6] Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night. \n[7]But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock. \n[8]Well, friend, I feel for you. But from my position I can't quite reach you. \n[9]Man, what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: I'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him! \n[10]Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want. Without bein kicked around. Now, we playin pool. Whyn't you take off? \n[11] \n[12]Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio. \n[13]I just hate to see a good man get it in the gut. 20. \n[14]stripping rifles. Prew is efficient and brilliantly fast, Maggio fumbling and slow. Maggio keeps looking over at Prew, admiring his speed. \n[15]Hey, I saw that -- I saw what you \n[16]toiling around track together, holding rifles. \n[17]I use to think a shipping clerk was a dog's life.  What I would not give to be back in Gimbel's basement! \n[18]Comin through! Comin through! Me and my table waiters! 35. \n[19]We workin our tail off. They runnin us to death. Hot stuff! Comin through hot stuff one side! \n[20]Hello, Prew! Bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it? \n[21]as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward Prew and Warden. \n[22]Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer. \n[23]Okay... so there y'are. Dues all paid up. Who ya got playin the piana -- a hippo? \n[24]There. You see. Any time women see a soldier, think he's drunk. Why? You know why? \n[25]Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull you apart! \n[26]Shut up, you Wop, he says to me! \n[27]Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise! \n[28]-- Ony my friends can call me Wop -- \n[29]Sure, I know who he is. Whadda I care? \n[30]as the music starts, Maggio stiffens, turns as if to go back. Prew holds tight, to his arm. \n[31] First I got to calm my nerves. Come on with me to a phone booth or some thin.  Where I will unveil this fifth of whisky I got under this loose flowing sports shirt. \n[32]I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink. \n[33]Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish. \n[34] \n[35]That sounds like a very profound remark. Maybe that's why I don't get it. \n[36]Hey! What you gonna do, marry this guy? Way you grinnin at him you look like his wife! \n[37] Okay. Back to old long-legged Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and acres. \n[38]Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it more than me.

One step closer an I'm gunna kill ya! 73. \n[47]I made a mistake I guess, but I don't see how I could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that. \n[48]I hit him hard as I could. His head must be solid ivory. \n[49]Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it. He's a good man, you know it? \n[50]Hello, citizen! I told ya I'd meet ya, dint I? 80. \n[51]I dint get no pass. I just took off. I meant to bring a girl with me but -- \n[52]I'm out for the night. I got a bellyfull. A nail, Prew. A stinkin nail. I'm thirsty for a nail. \n[53]Climb up on my shoulders, Prew.

I lost twenty-seven bucks. That's why I ain't got no girl. 81. \n[57]\n[58]finishing a long gulp of beer. He puts glass down on the bar, hard. \n[59]The Royal Hawaiian's jist around the corner. That's where them movie stars stay. Rita Hayworth and Joan Blondell and Maureen O'Hara... You look like a movie star, Lorene... yes, you do... How long 'fore we get in the war, Prew? \n[60]Tha's what you say. \n[61]Hot in here. \n[62]Swimming It's a great night for swimmin. 82. \n[63] Goin swimmin with a movie star... \n[64]Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping blissfully. He is clothed only in his shorts. Despite himself, Prew smiles. He shakes the reclining figure. \n[65]I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again. Just don't lock me up, sir. Honest, I won't. \n[66] Well, give 'em back to the Indians. The Indians need clothes. All they wear is G strings. \n[67]... maybe a movie star comes outs the hotel right now and picks us up and takes us back to the States in her private plane... and installs us in her private swimming pool -- \n[68] \n[69]Prew whispers to Maggio as he pulls him to his feet. \n[70]Stop it! \n[71]I'm sick of its Can't a man get drunk? Can't a man do nothin? Can't a man put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street? A man gotta be hounded every minute of his life? I ain't gain to take its I ain't no cowards I ain't yellows I ain't no bums I ain't no scum! MPs! MPs! COME AND GET US! \n[72]Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and runs toward the MPs. ANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, \"Can't a man do nothin?!\" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other, directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly. In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club and hits the first MP over the head. \n[73]Get back! I'm handlin this! Take off! \n[74]This ain't your affair! Keep out of this! \n[75] Come on. Is that the best you can do? I bet you eat Wheaties, don't you? Come on... You can't even knock me out -- no matter -- \n[76]Hello, men! Who's got the beer? \n[77]Okay, Brownie. Whatever you say. \n[78]You crazy. You -- \n[79]It was all my party. Don't worry about it. (pronounces \"e\" as in \n[80] I'm a prisoner. And prisoners ain't allowed to talk. They allowed to breathe though. If they good, that is. \n[81]... e-scape to Mexico and become a cowboy!... \n[82]his eyes following a movement of Fatso's hand. \n[83]as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the blaze of the headlights. There are scars, new and healing on Maggio's face. One of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy. A couple of teeth are missing. Weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a nightmare figure, an apparition. The whine in the distance is identifiable now. It is the siren of the Stockade. \n[84]... figgered you might be at Choy's... \n[85] ... done it like I said... e- scape... e-scape like I figgered... Under a tarp inna back of a truck from the Motor Pool they rode me right out just like I figgered like I said... Ony the tailgate came down 'bout a mile back... an I fell inns road... ... shoulda seen me bounce... musta broke somethin...  Prew... lissen... \n[86]Fatso... Fatso done it to me... yestiday he did it for keeps... He likes to whack me in the gut with a hoe handle an then he asks `that hurt?' and then I spit at him... Ony yestiday he done it ten times runnin an somethin bust... you know, like they was a fish swiminin aroun inside you... \n[87]Prew... they gonna send you to the Stockade...? \n[88] \n[89] ", "Sgt.": "", "Leva": "\n[1] I can't do no better on what you people pay me. \n[2]as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. \n[3]watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter. \n[4]Her and them sweaters. \n[5]as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering. \n[6]Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you. \n[7]Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty. \n[8]Okay, never me. But a lot of them. I know some of the Use she played 'around with, don't tell me. \n[9]But man, she sure is one, ain't she? \n[10]One woman. \n[11]I'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble. You better keep your mind off what you're thinkin. \n[12]Any word on Maggio's Court Martial? \n[13]He'll get the Stockade sure. \n[14]Can't a man rest himself for a min-- \n[15]listening. A strange look of pride. \n[16]Yes, sir. \n[17]I don't care. I can't issue any live ammunition without a signed order from an officer. \n[18] \n[19]I can't, Top. I got to obey my orders. No live ammo without a \n[20]I ain't gonna do it, Top. I -- \n[21]Remember I warned you. I did my best. \n[22]He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial.

Regular twelve bars blues. \n[4]'More dough than I can use. Re- enlistment Blues...' \n[5]Sir -- I'm sorry, sir but Private Prewitt's not to blame for this. Sergeant Galovitch started it. \n[6]Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are low. The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles. \n[7] \n[8]My friends had disappeared Barman said, `Take off, no credit here'... \n[9] \n[10] \n[11]Where you go in? \n[12]listening. Their bunks are next to each other. \n[13]as the Taps repeat is drawing to a close. He is lying on his side, turned toward the Bugler, a look of serenity, of peace on his face. His eyes close as he falls asleep. \n[14] Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler Field. ", "Mrs.": "\n[1] \n[2]Angelo, I don't believe I've met your friend.
