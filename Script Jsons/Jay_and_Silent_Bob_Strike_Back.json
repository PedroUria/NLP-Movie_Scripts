One of you can sit up here with me. \n[3]So where are you boys from? \n[4]What brings you to Indiana? \n[5]Hollywood, hunh? That's a long ways away. \n[6]Well, do unto others. That's what the Book says. \n[7]I live my life by it. \n[8]Of course. You know how lonely it gets on the road? Thanks to the Book, I'm never alone--if you know what I mean. \n[9]Are you kidding? I've dedicated my life to it. Every hour of every day. \n[10]You live by the Book, too? \n[11]That's good to hear. But it takes deed, not words. It's a lot easier to say you live by the Book than to actually do it. Can you do it? \n[12]No time like the present, right? ", "Brent": "\n[1]Say--what's all this talk about farting? \n[2]Of course they don't! Only skeevy stoners fart. \n[3]What up, homies?

Watch the language little boy. There are females present. \n[6]No--more like rabbits, dogs, cats... heck, even monkeys, If we don't speak for them, who will? Right, Jussy? \n[7]I'm down with this because I love animals, stupid. \n[8]Of course. Sheep are beautiful creatures. \n[9]Oh God, yes. \n[10]What is your damage little boy?

I'm just saying they shouldn't be loitering around the stores like they do. \n[5]See, man--if you were funnier than that, ABC never would've canceled us. \n[6]Nothing. \n[7]What service? \n[8]What the hell are you talking about? \n[9]Well if we were gay, that's how I'd see it. \n[10] \n[11] \n[12] \n[13]Now that was worse then Clash of the Titans. \n[14]Hey--remind me to renew that restraining order. \n[15]Because I'm gonna blast the flick on the Internet tonight.

Jussy. \n[3]We're in the middle of suburbia, Chrissy. Let's try to act like it. \n[4] \n[5]Fine--they can ride with us. But they're so out of here before we get to Boulder. \n[6]Hi Brent! \n[7]This is Brent. He's with us, too. \n[8]We're the Kansas State chapter of S.A.A.C.--Students Against Animal Cruelty. \n[9]Shut up, I'm thinking. \n[10]Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van?! \n[11]We needed Brent, Justice! He was our patsy! \n[12]Because I didn't want to blow our cover! \n[13](rubbing Chrissy's shoulders \n[14] \n[15]Enough! We have a very simple gang here, Justice. I'm the brains, Chrissy's the brawn, and Missy's the tech-girl. But lately, I'm having a hard time figuring out what you're doing here. \n[16]Don't change the subject. You know what you have to do now, right? Since you let our patsy slip away, you've gotta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place. They've gotta break into Provasik now. \n[17]Uh-huh. You'll do it; or you're out of this gang. Just use the little one's crush to convince him, since he's so fucking in love with you. \n[18]What--am I blind? He wasn't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron? \n[19]You're the one that brought the kid in, Jussy. So you've gotta make amends. \n[20]That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point. Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder. That gives you plenty of of time to work on him. \n[21]Why the fuck not? \n[22]Who's it going to be, Jussy--him or us? \n[23]Good. They do their part-- And we'll do ours. \n[24]Jay, before you go, could you say something into the camera about the clitoris. \n[25] \n[26]Uh--yeah. \n[27]Awesome. Knock 'em dead, Tiger. \n[28]Jussy. C'mon. \n[29]Hey, Lover-girl. You cock-block my authority again, you lose your fucking fronts, you got that? \n[30]Phase One, down. While we're executing Phase Two, you edit that tape and grab a new car. \n[31]Let's suit up. \n[32]They in? \n[33]Time to shine. Let's go. \n[34]Once we're inside, I want complete silence. Missy whipped this up. It counts our decibel level. If it goes into the red--alarm, we're dead. So not even the slightest noise, got it? \n[35](pokes her head back out \n[36]I can't believe it. Months of planning and it's all blown by a fucking fart. \n[37]That was always the plan, Justice!

You know, I don't get you, Justice. You used to be all about the girl stuff: stealing, boning, blowing shit up. Now you're like this little priss with a conscience. It's really a fucking drag. \n[42]If moping around over some little boy you're crushing on is being grown- up, then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos. \n[43]Awww. Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend? Then how about taking a shower? \n[44]This dopey bitch ordered the large plain, but I could go for some hot, thick, Sicilian. \n[45]That bitch!  That fucking, fucking bitch!!! Get dressed. We're going after her. \n[46]Which is more important to you: a fortune in diamonds or busting a nut? \n[47]Chrissy! Now! \n[48]Because she's gonna be one dead bitch. Hi, Jussy.

I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game? \n[19]We haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie! \n[20]It ain't me and Quiet Robert. It's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that run around saying \"Snitchy-Nitchies\" or something. \n[21]Shit yeah. We gotsa get paid. \n[22]What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door?

Does it say who's playing us in the movie? \n[31]Who? \n[32]You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it? \n[33]Word, bitch. Phantoms like a motherfucker. \n[34]Fuck him. What's the next one say? \n[35]Who the fuck said that shit?! \n[36] \n[37]But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life. \n[38]Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob! And maybe one night, me and Lunchbox'll be macking some bitch, and she'll be like \"Oooo! I want to suck youse guys dicks off. What's your names?\"  And I'll be like, \"Jay and Silent Bob.\" And she'll be like, \"Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs.\"  And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names! \n[39]But wait a second--if there wasn't a Bluntman and Chronic movie, then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob, right? \n[40](oblivious to Holden; to Bob \n[41]No, Holden McNeil--what's important here is that there's a bunch of motherfuckers we don't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who can't even get laid.

Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made! C'mon, Silent Bob-- \n[44]We're going to Hollywood. \n[45]Tickets? Since when did they start charging for the bus? \n[46]Didn't we used to ride that shit to school every day for free? \n[47]We in Hollywood yet? \n[48]I didn't ask you about Los Angeles. I asked you about Hollywood. \n[49]Don't change the subject! Are we in Hollywood yet or not? \n[50]Why don't you take your seat Ralph Kramden-- \n[51]I'm fucking bored, man. There ain't shit to so on this bus. \n[52]I already did that. Twice. \n[53]Yo, Gretzky--lemme get a turn. \n[54]That fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger! Go kick his ass! \n[55]You're my muscle, ain'tcha? \n[56]So go open a can of whup-ass on that little fuck, and get me his game! \n[57]You're one tough motherfucker, you know that? \n[58]Um--I think something's burning back here. \n[59]The whole fucking world's against us, dude. I swear to God. \n[60]This sucks balls, man. How come we ain't getting no rides? \n[61]Like how? \n[62]Yeah, but what happens when you get in the car, and you don't make with the head? Don't they kick your ass to the curb? \n[63]Eww! You eat the cock?!? \n[64]Yeah, but we ain't gay. \n[65]Well, I don't wanna cough up some dude's sperm! \n[66]There's one. On this side of it, we ain't gay. \n[67]What book? \n[68]New Jersey. \n[69]We're going to Hollywood. \n[70]Yeah--we're lucky you picked us up. \n[71](misinterpreting completely \n[72]Really? You? \n[73]I guess. This guy back there explained it to us. But I didn't think you'd be into that. \n[74]Shit--you nuns are alright. \n[75]You picked us up, didn't you? I gotta. \n[76]You want me to do it right now? \n[77]Alright. You hear that? She's not a Catholic. She's a Presbyterian. \n[78]Dude--she had seventies bush. \n[79]I can't believe this shit. Five hours and not a single ride. Every day, millions of people hitch to Hollywood and stop studios from making movies about 'em. But when you and me try it, it's like we're trapped in a fucking cartoon! \n[80]Zoinks, yo \n[81]\n[82]Youse guys need to turn those frowns upside down! And we got just the thing for that. We call them Doobie Snax. \n[83]Look at his fuckin' lipstick!!! He's got a stoner-boner!!! \n[84]Holy shit, I had a horrible dream. Yo, I'm hungry. Where can we get some breakfast? \n[85]Yo--check that shit out: the Internet. Let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick. \n[86]\"Any movie based on Jay and Silent Bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. Namely each other's.\" \n[87]Eww. \"Yes--they are real people. Real stupid people. Signed, Darth Randal.\" Motherfucker! It's time we wrote something back! Type this shit down. \n[88]All you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball- lickers.  We're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. Once we get to Hollywood and find those Miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. Then all you motherfuckers are next.  Love, Jay and Silent Bob. \n[89]That'll fucking show 'em. Now we eat our Egga-Mooby-Muffins, then get back on the road, get to Hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. No more hairy-bush nuns, no more dogs. We keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing-- and I mean NOTHING--distract me. \n[90]    \n[91]Oh, what--this? I just wear this for protection. You know--so no guys try to grab my shit. \n[92] \n[93]I mean hi. I'm Jay. And this is my hereto life-mate, Silent Bob. \n[94]Justice, hunh? That's a nice name. Jay'n'Justice, sitting in a tree. F- \n[95]Your friends, hunh? Where they at? \n[96]Dude--I think I just filled the cup. \n[97]Ladies, ladies, ladies! Jay and Silent Bob are in the Hizz-ouse!!! \n[98]Sure it is, Juggs. \n[99] \n[100] \n[101]And I can't believe fine-ass bitches like yourselves eat that shit. Don't you know fast food makes girls fart? \n[102]What're you guys, like a cover band or something? \n[103]What the fuck are you bitches babbling about? \n[104]So, what kind of animals are we talking about here--like bears and rhinos? \n[105]Hey, uh--Brent? Can I talk to you over here for a second? \n[106]Be honest, yo--you're down with this for the fine-ass pussy, right? \n[107]Even sheep? \n[108]They are beautiful, aren't they? \n[109]So then you'd fuck a sheep? \n[110]No, you misunderstand me, Prince Valiant. I mean if you were another sheep.  Would you fuck a sheep if you were another sheep? \n[111]That's what I thought. \n[112]\n[113]Is Hollywood near where we're going? \n[114]Ch'yeah, right. Jersey represent! \n[115]Well, we couldn't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more, 'cause of the strainen-en order, which sucks ass 'cause it's been like our home since we were kids. Silent Bob even busted his cherry there. \n[116]Look, fuck that fat fuck--I'm trying to tell a story here. \n[117]Anyway, we were talking to Brodie and he said there's gonna be a Bluntman and Chronic movie. So we went to see Holden McNeil, and he showed us the Internet, and that's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us. So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made.  And now we're here. \n[118]Yeah, I get that a lot. So you like animals, huh? \n[119]That's cool. Even snakes? \n[120]How about trouser snakes? \n[121] \n[122]Right about here's where the angel's supposed to show up and tell you not to pull your dick out. But we bitch- slapped that little fuck and sent him packing, so it's smooth sailing. Let 'er rip, boy! \n[123]Sorry I'm late. So what's the deal here? Oh, shit--you're not thinking of whipping your dick out at this fine piece of woman, are you? \n[124]Tell you what: look at Silent Bob. See if he thinks it's a good idea to whip your dick out. \n[125]That's it, boy--put the dick down. You gotta go from the heart, yo. No little perv bullshit will do for this one. Be smooth. Be Don Juan de la Nootch. Now I gotta go beat the shit out of two suckerpunching little bitches. Remember--don't pull your dick out until she asks you to. Or until she sleeping. Bunnnnggg! The Jay Angel blinks away. Justice looks at Jay, a bit confused. \n[126]Don't ask. So, uh--what can a pimp-daddy like me do to help the animals? \n[127]What the fuck are you talking about? Sure I do. I'd do anything for you. \n[128]I mean, youse guys! I'd do anything for youse guys. For the lift and shit. \n[129]Sure, I'm sure. I said it, didn't I. Fuck \n[130]You do that. \n[131]I'll be right here. \n[132]Fuck you. Fatty. \n[133]No, we're cool, thanks hon. \n[134]It just ain't the same, is it? This place licks balls compared to Quick Stop. \n[135]And speaking of licking balls--how 'bout that Justice chick? She is too fine.  And she smells so fucking pretty. She's got a nice voice, too. And that body?  Smoking. You know, she never once said \"fuck off,\" when I was talking to her, or pulled out the pepper spray, or nothing. I tell ya, Lunchbox--she could be the one. \n[136] \n[137]I'm gonna finger-fuck her tight little asshole! Finger-bang and tea-bang my balls--in her mouth! Where? Where? In her mouth--balls-a-plenty in her mouth!  Balls, balls, sweaty balls-- \n[138]Steal a monkey? Shit--no problem. \n[139]Yeah, Fuck--we steal monkeys all the time. Right, Lunchbox? \n[140]Oh, it for the best cause, mon cheri-- The cause of love. Snoogans-- \n[141]What's what? \n[142]What the fuck do you think it means? It means \"I'm kidding.\" \n[143]  \n[144]Don't, motherfucker. Don't you ruin this for me. Me and Justice are gonna get married one day, so don't be giving me that \"we-ain't-stealing-no- monkey\" look.  I'm Morris Day; you're Jerome, bitch. Don't forget that. That girl? That girl's in love with me. \n[145]As sure as I am that you're the hottest bitch I ever seen. \n[146]What's twisting that bitch's tits? \n[147]They don't? Well how 'bout \"piece of ass\"? \n[148]Well, what the fuck am I supposed to call you, then? \n[149] \n[150]What? \n[151]The female clitoris? \n[152]Nah, it's cool, hon. There's a few things I can say about the clit that I's like you to hear. I am the master of the clit! I make that shit work! It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!  No one rules the clit like me! Not this little fuck! None of you little fucks out there! I am the clit commander!!! Remember that-- commander of all clits! \n[153] \n[154]So--can I get a little blow job for good luck? \n[155]You fat fuck-- \n[156]Stay frosty, you big fucking softie. We've got a job to do. \n[157]Check this out, Lunchbox. Animal tranquilizer. This shit fucks you up like Percocets! \n[158]Hold this. Later, me and Justice can shoot each other with it and fuck like stoned test bunnies. Bunnggg. \n[159] \n[160]What the fuck are you looking at? There ain't no snacks here, man! Now we got what we came for, so let's get the fuck out! \n[161]Yeah, it's sad! But what the fuck are we supposed to do about it? \n[162]Oh shit-- \n[163]Justice-- \n[164]\n[165]This is Jussy's monkey \n[166] \n[167]Is that fucking thing waving at us? \n[168]Holy shit? That monkey understood us! Maybe it's some sort of super- monkey! \n[169]What the fuck was that for? It's not a stupid idea! I seen it in Congo? \n[170]You're my bitch. You get my back. Don't go joining this chimp's side. \n[171]Yo--what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab? Maybe they're making an army of 'em up there! Holy shit! Maybe it's a conspiracy--like on the X-Files Roswell--style! \n[172]Working in secret with a crew of double-dealing, nicotine-fiending fucks that're selling out the human race, these supermonkeys will use simian science and their genius IQ's to make man and monkey alike believe that they're the superior species! \n[173]Then all it'll take is one little monkey in a spiffy suit to whip the dumber chimps into a frenzy, until they go all ape-shit and start demanding more bananas, better pay, and human flesh! \n[174]You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job. And if you don't wind up with a monkey hog in your mouth, you'll be captured, killed or worse... \n[175]Eaten alive! \n[176]Then these monkey fucks'll start wearing our clothes and rebuilding the world in their image. \n[177]And only those who outwit those damn dirty apes'll ever remember that it was MAN who once ruled the earth! \n[178] \n[179]Not on my watch, motherfucker! \n[180]\n[181]Alright--you can live. For now. \n[182]You see that? Bitches love me. Besides--we're in the fucking clear, yo. It's not like anyone knows we stole the monkey. \n[183]\n[184]You know, Justice died trying to save this monkey, so maybe we should keep her around. That way, we can honor her memory. \n[185]Look at you Tubby Bitches. I'm waxing all sentimental, and you're all about a fucking meal and shit. Now ain't you glad we stopped to eat?  And you were all piss-scared the cops'd bust us or something. You know what I say? \n[186]You think they're talking to us? \n[187]\n[188]What the fuck are you waiting for? Go out there and give 'em the monkey. \n[189]Oh, what, man? I said that shit before I knew they were gonna shoot us! Yes--Jussy was a hottie, but I ain't takin' no bullet for no monkey! \n[190]Oh, brother--this is like something out of fucking Benji! Look man, maybe it's not that bad back at the lab! Maybe they experiment on 'em by, like making 'em fuck a bunch of different, good-looking monkeys. We don't know! Maybe they got it real sweet! \n[191]  \n[192]--kid \n[193]Don't shoot! We're just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment! \n[194]Yeah! We're gay! And this is our adopted love child! We're not from around here!  Don't make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah! You see the shit I gotta put up with for you! Now I got this guy thinking I'm gay! \n[195]And I'll tell you another thing: what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you and me are poo-gilists? How are we gonna get any pussy then, hunh? \n[196] \n[197]I'd like to offer a big gay thank- you, sir. We'll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for gays who are gay. \n[198]Well, that's 'cuz he's from my sperm. See, I knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who I also fuck on the side. So as not to be all-the-way-gay. But my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer. He loves the cock. \n[199]'Bye \n[200]I said you \"love the cock\"! I gotta be the craftiest motherfucker alive! \n[201]\n[202]\n[203]Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape! \n[204]You fat fuck. \n[205]You just--had to--order pancakes-- didn't ya? \n[206]\n[207]\n[208]Just like Winnie-the-Pooh. \n[209]This reminds me of the night I fucked your mom, yo. One big-wet, smelly, gaping hole, and me wishing I had a board tied to my ass-- \n[210]--to keep from falling in. \n[211]\n[212]\n[213]See, man?! He's lining us up like fucking circus seals! Well, I'm going first--I don't want no mouthful of monkey-spit when I gotta blow this fucking G-Man. \n[214]\n[215]\n[216]\n[217]You see that shit? Damn--remind me not to get on the monkey's bad side. Yo--boost her up. So we can talk, so we can get the fuck out of here. \n[218]\n[219]Man! Who the fuck just steals a monkey?! \n[220]Oh yeah. Well this fucking blows! We got one more day to stop those fucks from making that movie, and someone goes and takes the only thing I had left from the one woman I ever loved enough NOT to try to stick my hand down her pants! \n[221]Go after the monkey? How the fuck are we supposed to know where that thing's going? \n[222]What? What is that supposed to mean?! Don't just fucking point like-- You ain't the broad in the Children of a Lesser God. Use you fucking mouth for more than eating, ya tubby bitch! \n[223]You gotta take a shit? No--you gotta take a salad? Take a salad? What the fuck are you trying to say? \n[224]\n[225]Say it, don't spray it, bitch. \n[226]What? It's not like it's cheating. Justice blew up. \n[227]Oh yeah? How nasty? \n[228]Alright--first, I'll want to tongue your bung while you juggle my balls in one hand and play with my asshole with the other. But don't stick you finger in.  Then. I'll wanna pinky you and put it in your friend's brown, while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup. After that, I'll wanna smell your titties, for a while, and you can pull my nutsack up over my dick, so it looks like a Bullfrog. Then I want you to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in. Then we throw the Dixie cup out. \n[229] (shakes his head; to Bob \n[230]Alright, here's the plan: first, we find out where they're shooting that movie at. After we shut that shit down, we can start looking for the monkey. But before we do any of that shit, we gotta find a motherfucker in the know. Someone who's like, the mayor of Hollywood. \n[231]No man, but you want some weed? \n[232] \n[233]Shit, no, we might have to strike in September. \n[234]I hear that. Yo--maybe you can help us out. You know where they're shooting a movie around here. \n[235]It's a Miramax flick. We gotta bust it up so people stop calling us names on the Internet, even though they're not really talking about us but these characters based on us, and at the same time, find my ex-girlfriend-who- got-killed-in-a-car-explosion's monkey. \n[236]You know where Miramax is at? \n[237]We gotta play this right. \n[238]I hate how fake Hollywood is. \n[239]\n[240]Hey! I make you a deal: this guy'll suck your dick off if you let us go! \n[241]Well, how about this deal: he sucks my dick while you watch and jerk off. \n[242]Dude, it's either this or jail. And you know what they make you do in jail. \n[243]Well what are you waiting for, bitch? Start sucking. Bunnggg! Alright--where they shooting this movie at? \n[244]Worth a shot. Like a shot in the mouth, you gay bitch. Eww, dude--you were really gonna suck my dick. \n[245]This has gotta be the Bluntman Flick, 'cause that's those two fucks from that Mork movie! Now all we gotta do is figure out a way to get close to them-- \n[246] \n[247]On the count of three, we rush those fucks and beat the shit out of 'em. 'Cause if they're all fucked up, they can't make the move, right? Alright, then.  One--two-- \n[248]Affleck, you're the bomb in Phantoms, yo. \n[249]\n[250]What the fuck are we gonna do? \n[251]\n[252]Yo, I think that shit just kicked in. \n[253] \n[254]Yo-you really get to third base with the Russsian chick like you did in the movies? \n[255]She's fucking hot, man. If I was you, I'd been like-- \n[256] \n[257]Holy shit? You're the Dawson! \n[258]Yo, what's up with Pacey stealing Joey away from you? If I was you, I would've drowned his ass in your Creek and shit! \n[259]Joey, man! She's too fine! Yo--did you ever get to third base with her? \n[260]Stunt doubles for what? \n[261]These are the guys who are playing us, yo. We take them out, and bickety- bam! No movie. \n[262]Alright, here's what we do: start swinging, and don't stop until those young Hollywood fucks are out of commission. Ready? Break! \n[263]That's one funky monkey. \n[264](to door; deepening voice \n[265]NO! I mean, we kicked those guys' asses bad. They're--knocked out. \n[266] \n[267]What the fuck are we gonna do?! How are we gonna get out of here without them seeing us? \n[268]This was a good idea, Lunchbox. In these outfits we're totally incognito. \n[269]This must've set 'em back a couple hundred bucks. \n[270]Who the fuck are you? \n[271]Wait a sec--I thought Holden and Banky created this shit. \n[272]Wait, wait, wait!! Aren't you gonna direct us? \n[273]But we don't know what we're supposed to do here. We didn't even read the script. \n[274]Uh--Snootchie Bootchies. \n[275]What the fuck? \n[276]Why do they call you \"Cock-Knocker\"? \n[277]\n[278]Call me Darth Balls. Bunngg. \n[279]Now whose balls have been busted, bitch? \n[280]I thought you blew up, Boo Boo Kitty Fuck. \n[281]Yeah? So that means you'll fuck me, right? \n[282]Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting until I got to know her a little better. See, there was this little angel on my shoulder, and he said-- \n[283]  \n[284]\n[285]Yo--I hope one of 'em rips the other one's shirt off and we see some tit. \n[286]Banky fucking Edwards! Just the motherfucker we came to see! \n[287]All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet, 'cause of this stupid movie! \n[288]Here we go again-- \n[289]Yeah. \n[290]Shitcan this movie so we don't get called names on the Internet anymore. \n[291]Well this isn't fair!  We went to Hollywood, I fell in love, we stole a monkey, we got shot at, and got punched in the motherfucking nuts! We ain't leaving empty-handed! \n[292]What's up baby? You look good! \n[293]Oh yeah. Get the fuck offa me, pig! \n[294]Well, we want something for our mental anguish. \n[295]Half?!? \n[296]Fuck-you--you already said half? You can't take it back! \n[297]Yo, I was just about to jump in there and get your back. \n[298]Holy shit, the cops! We gotta get out of here! \n[299]Now wait a second-- \n[300]That's alright. I'm a junkie with a monkey. \n[301]I don't know. Will we fuck when you get out? \n[302]Don't change the subject. Will we fuck when you get out? \n[303]Fuck you. \n[304]What--here? \n[305]All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet, for starters. \n[306] \n[307] \n[308]Yes. Ma'am, Does-- William Dusky live here? \n[309]May we talk to him, please. \n[310]Yo--do you post as-- Magnolia-Fan on Movie Poop Shoot.com? \n[311]And did you write \"Fuck Jay and Silent Bob. Fuck them up their stupid asses? \n[312]On Movie Poop Shoot.com. did you say Jay and Silent Bob-- \"--are fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid.\" \n[313]Really-- \n[314]", "Justice": "\n[1]It's nice to meet you. \n[2]Oh, I'm not from around here. My friends and I are taking a road trip, and we just stopped to grab something to eat. \n[3] \n[4]This is Jay and Silent Bob. Guys, this is Sissy, Missy, and Chrissy. \n[5]I met 'em inside. They're gonna hitch a ride. \n[6]Chrissy, no! \n[7]They're just gonna tag along for a few miles. They won't get in the way, I promise. Please? \n[8]Honest Injun. \n[9]Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals. \n[10]Is that where you guys are from? \n[11]Oh, a Jersey Boy. What brings you all the way out here? \n[12] \n[13]Sorry. \n[14]Wow. I have no idea what you just said. \n[15]Sure. \n[16]You can't exclude an animal just because it's not cuddly. Of course I like snakes. \n[17]What's a trouser snake? \n[18]You really don't want to help us-- \n[19]You sure? \n[20]Well--okay. Let me talk it over with the other girls and get back to you. \n[21]You guys want anything from inside? \n[22]Ow! \n[23]Oh please--if I had to listen to one more of those stupid songs, I was going to throw him out myself. \n[24]We'll find someone else. Besides, I didn't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out. \n[25]Cover, shmover--you all hated his songs, too. \n[26] \n[27]They already do--she's the milkmaid, and she's the cow. \n[28]That makes two of us. \n[29]That's because very few names rhyme with \"douchebag.\" \n[30]And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin wouldn't amount to anything. \n[31]Uh-uh! \n[32]Jay? No he's not. \n[33]Well, maybe he was just raised with manners. \n[34]Jay is not taking Brent's place as the patsy. \n[35]I'm not gonna do it. \n[36]Because he's just to so innocent! \n[37]Look at him-- \n[38]It's not really stealing--it's liberating it, and-- Wait a second--did you say, \"No problem\"? \n[39]It's not like it's a bad thing. It's for a good cause. \n[40]What the heck is that? \n[41]\"Snoogans,\" I believe it was. \n[42]Ohhh. Well, that's too bad. \n[43]They're gonna do it. \n[44]Remember--we meet back here when you're done. You sure you're okay with this? \n[45]Maybe it's because women don't like to be called \"bitches,\" Jay. \n[46]How about not. \n[47]Something sweet, you big goof. Something nice. \n[48] \n[49] \n[50]Jay, you don't have to do this. \n[51]Yes, sir. \n[52]You are so gay. \n[53]We can't just leave them like this! That alarm's gonna bring the cops here any minute! \n[54]\n[55]  \n[56]\n[57]Your tape worked. The news is all about Jay and Silent Bob's Provasik break-in, with almost no mention of the Diamond heist. \n[58]Don't you feel any regret? Jay and Bob don't deserve this. They were really sweet. \n[59]They're your gang. \n[60]We all gotta grow up some time. \n[61]Don't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys? \n[62] \n[63]Oh my God! Jay! No! \n[64]Fuck it. \n[65]It was just a diversion so we could steal these. \n[66]And they're not the leaders of C.L.I.T. The C.L.I.T. is not real. \n[67] \n[68]  \n[69]I can't do that, Sissy \n[70] \n[71]You're no match for my \"Shaolin Monk.\" \n[72]A little \"Venus's--flytrap\"? \n[73]How about a little \"Bitch, My Man Ain't Yo Baby's Daddy\"? \n[74]Call me Boo-Boo Kitty Fuck--BITCH! \n[75]C'mon guys. It's over. \n[76]No. I'm tired of running. \n[77]You awake, Marshal? Marshal? \n[78] \n[79]You have friends in the F.B.I.? \n[80]Maybe not. I can make you a deal that'll get you into the F.B.I., regardless of test scores. \n[81]You drop the charges against Jay and Silent Bob and say you never found the ape.  Make sure the world knows they're not in control of any C.L.I.T. \n[82]I'll explain later, Jay In exchange, I'll give you the diamonds I stole, and turn in Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and myself. But I want a reduced sentence. \n[83] \n[84]I'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence. \n[85]If I go to prison, will you wait for me? \n[86]Snoogans. \n[87] \n[88]Are these leg cuffs really necessary?

I can't believe what a pushover you are. \n[6]Hi Brent! \n[7]Brent, tell these sillies that girls don't fart. \n[8]And we're on our way to Colorado to give Provasik a piece of our minds! \n[9]What the fuck are we gonna do now? \n[10](slapping Justice upside the head \n[11]Not as much as I hate you. \n[12]Fuck, if I don't get to kill someone soon, I'm gonna--fucking kill someone! \n[13]Then how about you help me take the edge off? \n[14]Oh, I'm a cow, am I?  I'm a mad cow, bitch. And now I'm gonna rip your head off and fuck your spine stump. \n[15]Shit--your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme. \n[16]  \n[17]Holy fuck--the little stoner was right-- \n[18]Boom Box! \n[19]Kaboom, you little stoner fucks. \n[20]It's set. Let's roll. \n[21]The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals. \n[22]I'll show you nasty, you little slut. \n[23]Fine--we'll take yours. I am gonna stain your sheets, bi- otch. \n[24]Fuck that, I didn't get to cum yet. \n[25]Fuck-- \n[26]Shut the fuck up before I shoot you where you stand in your pansy red booties. \n[27]"}}
