Okay now! \n[145]...Well fuck. \n[146]...Don' t you want me to wrap it in a T-shirt or something? \n[147]Kids, lemmme tell ya... \n[148]...They'll run ya ragged. \n[149]Up your ass. \n[150]GOD dammit! \n[151]No, it's okay. \n[152]Done. \n[153]Is that your underwear? \n[154]Where's the rest? Never mind. What do you want? \n[155]What. \n[156]...You know when I was your age, I didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and I wasn't any bigger than you. One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?' \n[157]No. He kicked my ass. You know why? \n[158]What the fuck? No. \n[159]Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't busy busting my ass, he was puttin' out cigarettes on my neck. \n[160]The world's fuckin' unfair -- it don't give ya nothing. You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need. Stand up for yourself... stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something. Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just leave me the hell out of it. \n[161]Okay, go ahead... \n[162]...Get the fuck outta here... \n[163]Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy. \n[164]Huh? What? \n[165]...What the fuck?! \n[166]Now you listen here, you -- \n[167]...Pricks ficks? \n[168]Yeah, well I guess that's how you got the upper hand. \n[169]Negotiating. \n[170]Yeah, and I can get another midget. \n[171]Yeah, yeah. \n[172]Ah, fuck it. \n[173]Yeah. \n[174]Ah, nothin'. \n[175]Not really. \n[176]Yeah. Lemme alone. \n[177]-- Kid. \n[178]Later today, when the paramedics come and bag up Santa... \n[179]...make sure the cops get this letter. It tells about all the bad things that -- that -- what the fuck happened to your eye? \n[180]Well goddamnit... \n[181]I think I've turned a corner. \n[182]No no. No; I beat the crap out of some kids today -- but, you know, for a purpose. It really made me feel pretty good about myself -- like I did something constructive for a change. Accomplished somethin'. \n[183]...Hello? \n[184]...Granma? \n[185]Granma... \n[186]...Oh jeez. \n[187] \n[188](frozen; teeth still gripping panties \n[189]...Yes? \n[190] \n[191]Why'd you paint it brown? \n[192]...Thanks. \n[193]Hold on a minute. \n[194]Nothin'... it's just... I'm... well... I'm sorta... fucking... touched. \n[195]...I don't know if I can fuck... \n[196]\n[197]Who the fuck is Thurman? This is you? Your name's Thurman? \n[198] \n[199]Jesus. \n[200]Whaddya you care what I think, anyway? What do I fuckin' know? Better than I ever did. I never got any B's, \n[201]Oh... \n[202] \n[203]Oh... \n[204](pause, then sincerely to the kid \n[205]\n[206]You fuckin' spic! \n[207] \n[208]'Tendo it is. \n[209]...Everything I touch turns to shit and dies. \n[210]Barbie it is... \n[211]...That it? \n[212](red-faced, holding breath \n[213]Up your ass. \n[214]Oh shit... \n[215]It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt. \n[216]...You know Andy Pitts? \n[217]No, Andy Lapitski. Andy Pizzarelli is Andy Blue Balls. \n[218]Andy Lapitski can get into anything. Anything. They say he's been in Margaret Thatcher's pussy. \n[219]In the joint he told me that the Kitnerboy... \n[220]...cannot be cracked. \n[221]No... I'm saying it's gonna take me a minute. \n[222]Piece of cake. \n[223]...I'll be right back. I gotta grab one thing. \n[224]Shit... which did he say? \n[225]Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this. \n[226]Wuddya mean, fucking guy's greedier than... \n[227]...greedier than fuck. \n[228]Dead, huh... \n[229]...I didn't even know he was sick. \n[230]Uh-huh. \n[231]Sure. The three B'a. \n[232]You're monsters. \n[233]Oh, I don't mean layin' me out. I understand that. But just look at ya. All the shit... grabbin' all this shit -- do you really need all this junk? ...This is Christmas? \n[234]Shit! \n[235]...Fuckin' kid! \n[236]Fuck me... \n[237]...fuck me fuck me fuck me... \n[238]...It's Christmas... and the fucking kid is getting his present. \n[239]Up your ass! \n[240]Dear kid. I hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much I guess. \n[241]...Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. I am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways... \n[242]...Thank you for giving that letter to the cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. And now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever. \n[243]...As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi. \n[244]...So I'll be staying in Phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. They're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so I'll see you when I come over to fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no shit from nobody. Least of all yourself. Anyways... see ya soon... \n[245]...Santa.

I was against the Clinton impeachment. What a man does with his penis -- Oval Office, Women's Big &amp; Tall -- it's not for the American people to say. \n[16]But when you're dealing with children, a tender sensibility, a position of trust -- then perhaps, someone who has screaming orgasms with large women -- \n[17]Though I can't fire him for that. \n[18]Sizisra.
