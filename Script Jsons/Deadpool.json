Once you go black, you never go back! \n[6]Thanks! \n[7] \n[8]Wade Wilson. Jeremy, that's a no go on the tiperoo. I'm not here for him. I'm here for you. \n[9]  \n[10]PS, I'm keeping your wallet.         Ya did kinda give it to me... \n[11]I will shoot your fucking cat. \n[12]Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in? Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? \n[13]Good.   `Cause she knows you. \n[14]What situation isn't improved by pizza? \n[15]  \n[16] \n[17]So keep away from Meghan.       We cool? \n[18]Then we're done. \n[19]Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways. I've got some hard spots too. That came out wrong. Or did it? \n[20]\"Oooo, oooo, oooo!\" \n[21]You've seen the last of Jeremy. \n[22]That's why we do it. \n[23] \n[24] \n[25]That I ain't. \n[26]Boothe!

Onroflensky? Olly-Olly-Oxen-Free? \n[30]  \n[31]Classified. They have a wonderful TGIFridays. Those guys know their way around a Loaded Potato Skin. The point is, I'm trying to put those days in my rear-view. \n[32]Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck? Tell him it's from Boothe. Little foreplay. \n[33]I don't take the shits.       I just disturb them. \n[34] \n[35]Lemme guess. Ya got Boothe in Sister Margaret's dead pool. \n[36]You did not bet on me to die. You bet on me to die. \n[37]Weasel, you're the world's worst friend. Joke's on you. I'm living to 102. Like those old Quaker biddies on the Today Show. And retiring on my winnings. \n[38]The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong. Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars who make 80 mil a year and think they're immune to the pitfalls of addiction and consequence. He'll be fine. Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune! \n[39]Tight. \n[40]What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this? \n[41]Buck, you'd best apologize, before- \n[42]Yeah, that. \n[43]OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas... \n[44]Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump fuzzies for money? \n[45]Rough childhood? \n[46]Daddy left before I was conceived. \n[47]I didn't know there was any other place to put one out. \n[48]Me too.     Uncle. \n[49]I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet, which was also my- \n[50]So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know sleep. It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors. \n[51]Hopefully you. Later tonight. And my Uncle Kevin. \n[52]What can I get for two-hundred-seventy three bucks... and a Yogurtland rewards card? \n[53]Time to put balls... in holes. \n[54]You said whatever I want. \n[55]Tough call. Just trying to get to know the real you... not the plunging- necklined, short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood. \n[56]Prepare to lose tragically. \n[57]The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. \n[58] \n[59]M'lady? \n[60]Arus. And you're more evil than evil King Zarkon himself. \n[61]How many more minutes for this? FYI. Five mini lion-bots come together to make up the super-bot. \n[62] \n[63]What do we do with the remaining two minutes thirty seven seconds? \n[64] \n[65] \n[66]   \n[67]Happy Chinese New Year's... \n[68]Happy Fourth of July! \n[69] \n[70]  \n[71]  \n[72]If your left leg is Thanksgiving, and your right leg is Christmas... \n[73]...can I visit you between the holidays? \n[74]Holy fucking shit. \n[75] \n[76]...about why we're so good together. \n[77]Your crazy    matches my crazy.

Marry me? \n[79]They say one month's salary. \n[80]Slow month. I've been waiting for this day like Boss Hogg waits to get to the crazy cheesy crust... \n[81]I do. \n[82]Thought you charged extra for that. \n[83]So that's a-? \n[84]What if I never let go? \n[85] \n[86]It's like I made you in a computer. \n[87] \n[88]Perfect. \n[89]Wee break. \n[90]Shake it like a- Uh. You get it. \n[91]You're clowning.     You're not clowning?        I sense clowns. \n[92]   \n[93]This is my most prized possession. \n[94]Wham! `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point. \n[95]But this. A little piece of me died the day this came out... \n[96]Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death. \n[97]Right! The tumors are only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All the things you can live without. \n[98]Babe, we've been through this! Cancer's a real shit-show. A Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa- State-Fair shit-show. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me me. \n[99]I swear, I'll find you in the next life. And boom-box `Careless Whisper' under your window. Wham! \n[100]Super fucking bad-ass. \n[101] \n[102]Nothing.    Everything. \n[103]Sorry. Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it. \n[104]They've made three of those movies. At some point you wonder if he's just a bad parent. \n[105]Three shots of Patron Silver, Weez.     And a cure to terminal cancer. \n[106]You're starting to sound like Vanessa... \n[107]She sent away for all these colorful clinic brochures. I hear Chechnya's nice this time of... never. Then there's China... Central Mexico... Know how they say `Cancer' in Spanish? \u00a1El C\u00e1ncer.' \n[108]Forget your scythe? \n[109]Stalker alert. \n[110] \n[111]To wash the taste out. It's hard to forget being so... impressive. \n[112]People change. \n[113]I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. \n[114]I already tried the hero business. Let's just say it left a mark. The only chance you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck- it.' \n[115]For now, I'll get through this with the one I love.

And warmer hands. \n[129]Easy!   Aren't you a little strong for a lady?   I'm calling wang. \n[130]It doesn't look like a hospital. It looks like Chlamydia holding still. \n[131]Oral fixation? \n[132]Can I expect turndown serv-? \n[133]Something in your teeth. \n[134]Made you look! Hey, is Ajax your real name? `Cause it sounds suspiciously made up. What's it really? Steve? Mark? Trevor? Kyle? Elliot? \n[135]We'll see! \n[136]  \n[137]Puppies. \n[138] \n[139]But me, I've been making a list of things I still plan to do. \n[140]I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs... Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch... \n[141]Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven... \n[142]Don't take that shit, Cunningham! How tough can he be? Name like Francis. \n[143]That's right! He got `Ajax' off a dish- washing liquid! Legal name's Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. \n[144]Dry-cleaning tag, Francis.     Snagged it off your lab coat. Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 \n[145]FYI. I may be able to get you the super- hero discount. \n[146]Uh, I wouldn't do that. Here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there. \n[147]Yeah.   Francis.    That's what I think. \n[148]Um.   What? \n[149]And I thought you were dicks before this. \n[150]Seriously. Now you do have something in your teeth. \n[151] \n[152]That was a lot of... what's the word... syllables. Are you saying I'm better? \n[153]   \n[154]You f-fucking sadistic- \n[155] \n[156]You... sadistic... fuck! \n[157]Then time to make me me again. \n[158]Fuck! \n[159]Ow. \n[160]No... no way! I'm not making her life as ugly as mine! \n[161]Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I belong in a circus, the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons. \n[162]And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug, the asshole who ran that mutant factory, escaped to who knows where. \n[163]Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself. \n[164] \n[165] \n[166] \n[167]What? \n[168]Deadpool.

Order. The pizza. \n[2]The Mr. Merchant who didn't.         Order. The. Fucking. Pie. \n[3]The fuck are you? And what are you doing in my crib?! \n[4] \n[5]Dodged a big time bullet on that o- \n[6]Can I at least have my Sam's Club card baaa- \n[7]I don't have a cat! ", "Ajax": "\n[1] \n[2]There won't be one. Demand is high. You aren't the only one with a war to win. \n[3]There's been a small... disruption in our supply chain. We'll deliver in full the following month. Say, ten percent off for the inconvenience? \n[4]We appreciate your business. \n[5] \n[6]Actually, I do. \n[7]Patience, Angel. All in good time. \n[8]You're a talker. \n[9] \n[10]The Workshop is not a government program. It's a private institution tasked with turning reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. I'm about to remake your life. But if you think cancer cures painlessly, you're wrong. If you think super-human powers are acquired painlessly, you're wrong. \n[11]We're injecting you with a serum that activates mutant genes. For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress. \n[12]You've heard the whole make-an-omelette, break-some-eggs bit? I'm about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of hurt I can't describe and you can't prepare for. It's cruel stuff. And there's no way out for you. No secret you can tell me. No soft spot in me to appeal to. \n[13]One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not just the president. I'm a client?' I've been through this procedure myself. It made me stronger. It also scorched my nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact... I no longer feel anything. \n[14]Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor. \n[15] \n[16]The serum I'm injecting you with targets any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. \n[17]Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we must subject you to extreme stress. \n[18]If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. \n[19]If not, we'll have no choice but to keep hurting you in new and different ways. Each more painful than the last. \n[20]Until you finally mutate.      Or die. \n[21]With the mouse ears? Creative, and delicious. \n[22]It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't have you giving up on us, can we now, you little worm? \n[23]You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty mouth shut. \n[24]Is that what you think? \n[25]Seems your genes are as stubborn as you. But we can still increase your suffering. We don't even have a name for this next toy. \n[26]We reduce the oxygen in the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. \n[27]If you start to pass out, and your brain waves slow, we turn up the O2. If you catch your breath, and your heart rate slows, we turn it back down. And we leave you. Right. There. \n[28]Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man. This device prolongs that stress. For hours, days, weeks... \n[29]The saddest part? You still think we're making you a super-hero. You. Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza guys. Hip deep in hookers. You're nothing. I'd call you an asshole, but I'd have to answer to assholes. Little secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make super-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We're gonna fit you for a control collar and auction you to the highest bidder. Who knows what they'll force you to do. Put down freedom fighters. Murder innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or two. \n[30]Enjoy the weekend! Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 \n[31] \n[32]    \n[33]Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. \n[34]No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid. \n[35]Either I kill him, or he kills me.     Let's put him out of our misery... \n[36]Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king. \n[37]You give me too much credit. This... this is the result of your genes. \n[38]The punch bowl merely raised your stress to trigger the mutation. \n[39]Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides! \n[40]I've seen similar side-effects before.         I could cure them for you. But really, where's the fun in that? \n[41]I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe you no longer need it. But I do. \n[42]He's all yours. \n[43] \n[44]Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I think he earned that one, yeah? You take off. Go on... off you go. \n[45]One question. What's my name? \n[46]Didn't think so. \n[47]You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug. \n[48]Say it.     `Francis.' \n[49]Quit showing off, Angel. \n[50]Wade Fucking Wilson. \n[51]I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too. Only wish I mended the same. \n[52]Not to worry. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms. \n[53]He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual. \n[54]What say we leave the matches at home? \n[55]You have Wade Wilson to thank for this. \n[56]`The good Lord sends the fishing... \n[57]...but you must dig the bait.' \n[58]That's what I thought, but he keeps on coming back. Like a Bad Jesus. But despite all Wade's powers, I still hold the advantage: He feels. Too strongly for his own good. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block. \n[59]How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer mutant in tights... \n[60]`Til now. \n[61]That never gets old.    But neither will you. \n[62] \n[63]You two have a lot to work out. Take a deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice... \n[64]...of words. \n[65]I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you. \n[66]Fine.   Fists. \n[67]Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where. \n[68]You heard me. \n[69]Sounds even stupider when you say it. ", "Dopinder": "\n[1]Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? \n[2]Smells good, no? \n[3]Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. \n[4]Because you hailed it? \n[5]And how does Ms. Mama June taste? \n[6]Shall we turn back? \n[7]My card.    That's $27.50. \n[8]Be sure to... ask for me again? \n[9]And a convivial... Tuesday in April to you, Pool... Guy. \n[10]Where do you want to be going! \n[11]I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool. But Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer - than me. \n[12]I cannot be stopping. \n[13]She indeed has ESPN!    I am quite uninsuranced. \n[14]Who brought this twinkly man? \n[15]Oh, that?      That was Bandhu. \n[16]My romantic rival, Bandhu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, D.P. I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish. Then dump his lifeless corpse on Gita's doorstep like a cat with a dead bird. Mom and Dad will be over the moon. \n[17]Fine, fine. Safe and gentle-like.
