What can you do? There's nothing to be frightened of. \n[63]I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful. \n[64]I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ... \n[65]Give that to me. \n[66]One last time.  Give me the box. \n[67]\n[68]Come to Daddy. \n[69]Some things have to be endured ... ... take it from me ... ... Come to Daddy ... \n[70]I don't think so.
