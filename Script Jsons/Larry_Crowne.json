I'm going to lose it, aren't I? \n[157]You guys are forced to say that, aren't you? \n[158]Should I begin? \n[159]first crossing of the Equator... \n[160]Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it... \n[161]   \n[162]      \n[163]Square footage at this price is a bargain. \n[164]  \n[165]Chapter four. 74. \n[166]   \n[167]Ms. Tainot? \n[168]  \n[169]Do you need a ride? Hop on. \n[170]I was heading home. Right? We're done scooting? \n[171]Seriously. I offer you a ride. \n[172]I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case. \n[173]An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea. \n[174]In those shoes? \n[175]Put this on. Strap your legs round my engine and 80. \n[176]Ain't you a ball of fun? \n[177]I do want to survive this night. \n[178]Where am I taking you? \n[179]I may use this as a presentation in class. \n[180]I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could. \n[181]Someone's getting pinched... \n[182]Bad night for that guy. \n[183]Unit 114. \n[184]You don't want to give me your pass code. \n[185]This it? \n[186]I'll get the door for you 83. \n[187]What? \n[188]What? \n[189]What are you talking about? \n[190]When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony. \n[191]Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. \n[192]I assumed you preferred Ms 84. \n[193]That's a long story and it's late. My helmet? \n[194]  \n[195]Thanks. \n[196]We all have crushes on you. Even the gals. \n[197]Wow... \n[198]Yes, you do.. In you go.  Close the door. Lock it! \n[199]Goodnight, whoever you are! \n[200]       \n[201]Epilog. School today. \n[202]If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. \n[203]How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. \n[204]Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can. \n[205]I wouldn't want that. \n[206]Sure. Nothing happened. At all. \n[207]None. \n[208]        \n[209]  \n[210]I have to sell my car. 91. \n[211]If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it. \n[212]Half my UniMart salary. \n[213]I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days. \n[214]Everyone keeps saying that. \n[215]The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery. \n[216]  \n[217]Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. \n[218]Why are you on the Register? 93. \n[219]Cash. No receipt. \n[220]'Consumerism'. \n[221]The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'. \n[222]You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final. \n[223]What? Why? \n[224]Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education. \n[225]    \n[226]Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce. \n[227]      \n[228]Might not make it. I have finals! \n[229]She's insane. \n[230]Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order? \n[231]Mrs. Tainot. \n[232]There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast. \n[233]You'll be the judge of that. \n[234]So, your meal is satisfactory? \n[235]Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job? \n[236]Shall I prepare you another batch? \n[237]Then I will return to my station.. \n[238]   \n[239]    \n[240]   \n[241]Priceless at a buck apiece. \n[242]      \n[243]You'll get me top price. \n[244]Here's lunch as promised! \n[245]    \n[246]Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony. \n[247]Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough. \n[248]Ah. Forget it. Keep the change. \n[249]I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy. \n[250]Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot. \n[251]    \n[252]This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity. \n[253]I'll have to see. \n[254]       \n[255]Cars not much. Devices some. \n[256]In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. \n[257]Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. \n[258]  \n[259]All better now. Should be able to find your way. \n[260]My Boss. Back to work. Thanks for the good news... \n[261]  \n[262]I met you. \n[263]     ", "Alvarez": "\n[1]Four Toby Jug beer steins - $2.69! "}}
