This won't wait. \n[2]There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them? \n[3]Should be there any minute.  They came out a side door a while ago. Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's headed back to spell you. \n[4]I know.  You can go home if you want to.  I'll come relieve you myself. \n[5]He called a minute ago looking for you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and he wanted out.  I said you were on the way.  He could split. \n[6]Any sign of a green-eyed monster? \n[7]Above you!  Look out! \n[8]Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant. \n[9]I'm in. \n[10]  \n[11]", "Dr.": "\n[1]Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess. \n[2]You're late, Vince. \n[3]Oh yes!  Who could forget.

The head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed.  It almost looks like... \n[8] \n[9]What are we talking about here? \n[10]Right. The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please? \n[11]Curious.  There's something missing. \n[12] \n[13]Okay.  One saliva test.  Now... let's look at these lacerations.  They start wide and then converge. \n[14]Too extreme.  Perhaps some kind of weapon.  I'm now probing the wound and... there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib.
