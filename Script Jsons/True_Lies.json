It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period? \n[2]Well.  And I thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires. \n[3]Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces. \n[4] \n[5]Harry!  I thought I might see you again.  I just didn't  except you to call so soon. \n[6]I agree. \n[7]So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters? \n[8]So what did these... people... say about me exactly? \n[9]Those wimps.  It's because I use                       * my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike. I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going. \n[10]You see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient Persia. Unfortunately, ancient Persia is twenty feet under the sand of                          * Iran, Iraq and Syria.  Not the most popular places lately.  So I've had to become an expert in international diplomacy. \n[11]Well, do you see anything you like, Mr. Renquist? \n[12]  \n[13] \n[14]It's a good thing you pay me well. \n[15]No.  He checked out okay-- \n[16]What do you want me to do? \n[17]How? \n[18]   \n[19]Hello, Harry. \n[20]Do you like my tomb?  The museum                       * financing fell out, so I thought                       * your clients might be interested. \n[21]Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,                       * so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins. \n[22]I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it. \n[23]Yes, I do. \n[24]Look at this.  People who dies twenty centuries ago. \n[25]They breathed and loved and wept, just like us.  And now their ideals, their religions, their social orders... are gone like mist.  What did any of it matter? \n[26]I only hope they lived well. That they got what they wanted. \n[27]Getting what you want is the only important thing. \n[28]Yes what? \n[29] \n[30]Who's your little friend? \n[31] \n[32]No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night. \n[33]Something before take-off? \n[34]She was telling the truth, wasn't she Harry?  She really doesn't know.  Interesting. \n[35]His wife. \n[36]Incredible, aren't they?  Warrior figures from the Persian Empire of Darius the First, around 500 BC.  I call them \"The Four Horsemen\". \n[37]They're absolutely priceless. \n[38]Here you go, dear. \n[39]This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty. \n[40]Not exactly. \n[41]Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist. \n[42]Because they're very well-funded raving psychotics, and I'm getting a lot of money. \n[43]You think I care about their                           * cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         * See, America is on top now .  .                        * .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         * civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living                          * well takes money.                                      * \n[44] \n[45]Sure.  Say that now. \n[46]Thanks for everything, Harry.  It was good while it lasted. \n[47]Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine. \n[48]Hold that thought. \n[49]My condolences to the window.                          * \n[50]Let's go, Suzy Homemaker. \n[51]Like one? \n[52]Shit!

You make all the other salesmen jealous? \n[5] \n[6]The plumber came yesterday.  He said they have to dig under the slab or something and it's going to be six hundred dollars to fix. \n[7]It's not okay.  It's extortion. \n[8]I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks. \n[9]I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something. \n[10]Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town. \n[11]Yeah.  You know Harry. \n[12]I won't let you down, Brad. \n[13]* * \n[14]You bitch. \n[15]Harry only has two moods: busy...                      * and asleep. \n[16]I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon. \n[17] \n[18]Hi, Charlene?  It's Helen.  Is he there? \n[19]Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that                        * you'll be home at eight.  I don't                      * want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise? \n[20]Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry. \n[21]Where are you going? \n[22]No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake! \n[23]That's not true, honey-- \n[24]Dana!  Come back here! \n[25]It's okay, don't bother, Harry. \n[26]Yeah.  It was great. \n[27]Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's only one present you have to open tonight. \n[28]Don't move.  I'll be right back. \n[29]I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office? \n[30] \n[31](putting on black \n[32]My husband the hero. \n[33]I'll be right there, honey.  Just a minute. \n[34]Just a second. \n[35]Happy Birthday, Harry. \n[36]  \n[37]  \n[38]Simon?  Ohmygod. \n[39]Hello, Simon? It's all right.  There's no one around. \n[40] \n[41]You mean right now? I guess so.  Okay.  I'll be right there. Yes.  I can't wait.  Bye. \n[42]Can you cover me for an hour? \n[43]Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him. \n[44]So.  You came by to see me today? \n[45]They must've just missed me. \n[46]Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it. \n[47]Oh, sure.  Fine. I'll get some more gravy. \n[48]Hello? \n[49]Yes.  Go ahead. \n[50]  \n[51]Yes.  I suppose so.  Where? \n[52]I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry. \n[53]   \n[54]   \n[55]I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone. \n[56]I understand. \n[57]Where were you?  On a... uh,                           * mission? \n[58]Worse than Cairo?                                      * \n[59]  \n[60]Yes. \n[61]That was you?! \n[62]Tell me what happened? \n[63]You can trust me completely. \n[64]Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night. \n[65]Were they trying to kill you?                          * \n[66]And you chased one? \n[67]You can't?                                             * \n[68]What is it you want me to do? \n[69]You'll call me then? \n[70]Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late. \n[71]Out. \n[72] \n[73]What's happened? \n[74]What is it you need me to do? \n[75]I'm married! \n[76]We're going to Paris? \n[77]I don't know.  I have to think... \n[78]Okay.  I'll do it. \n[79]It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I-- \n[80]NO!  Stop! Get off me RIGHT NOW! \n[81]Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary. \n[82]He said he was an American agent. \n[83]I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him. \n[84]About two weeks ago I was at the mall, having coffee... \n[85]      \n[86]I should have gone to the police, I suppose. \n[87]I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen. \n[88]Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park. \n[89]Helen. \n[90]I just glances inside. \n[91]He needed my help. \n[92]No. \n[93]Well, maybe a little. \n[94]No!  Never! \n[95]I wasn't cheating! \n[96]Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company. \n[97](she sighs, nodding \n[98]That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these? \n[99]My husband is a good man. \n[100]He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife. \n[101]Yes. \n[102]I don't know.  I guess I needed something... \n[103]I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special. \n[104]There's so much I wanted to do in this life, and it's like I haven't done any of it.  And the sand's running out of the hourglass.  I want to be able to look back and say:  See!  I did that.  It was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and I fucking did it! And I frankly don't give a shit if you understand this or not. \n[105]No. \n[106] \n[107]Let me out of her!  Right now! \n[108](she swings again,  \n[109]What? \n[110] \n[111]I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him. Can I go home, please? \n[112]Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see-- \n[113]What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved? \n[114]My husband can't know about this. \n[115]I think so. \n[116] \n[117] \n[118]Where are you off to young lady? \n[119]  \n[120]Hello? \n[121]Oh.  Yes? \n[122]What? \n[123](thinking for a second, \n[124]Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey. \n[125]Do you have an envelope for Doris? \n[126]Do I have to... you know-- ? \n[127]I'm Michelle.  Carla's sick.  She thought you might like me, so -- \n[128] \n[129]I thought you only liked to watch. \n[130]Harry-- ?! \n[131]He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right? \n[132]Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this. \n[133]Listen, you don't need him, he's nothing.  He's a sales rep for a computer company, really-- \n[134]That was unnecessary. \n[135]What were you doing there? \n[136]You know her? \n[137]I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are? \n[138]Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep. \n[139]No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years-- \n[140]Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter-- \n[141]Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this? \n[142]Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii-- \n[143]N-no. \n[144]How can Harry do that?  He's a salesman for chrissakes. \n[145]You bastard!!  You lying son of a bitch!! \n[146]Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig! \n[147]You bugged me?!! \n[148] \n[149]Something you obviously have a hard time doing! \n[150]What did he give you? \n[151]It makes you tell the truth? \n[152]Is it working yet? \n[153]Are we going to die? \n[154]I'd say it's working. \n[155]Okay, okay.  I get it.  How long                       * have you been a spy, Harry? \n[156]My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty? \n[157]What about Juno? \n[158]Did you pork her Harry? \n[159] \n[160]What is it? \n[161]Harry... snap out of it! \n[162]Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again. \n[163]Do you still love me? \n[164]As much as you used to? \n[165]* \n[166]I married Rambo.                                       * \n[167]If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? \n[168]So there's no border, no customs.                      * They can just drive anywhere they                      * want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       * stop them .  .  . \n[169]What are you going to do? \n[170]Oh shit. \n[171]Oh my God.  Harry. \n[172] \n[173]You... bitch!! \n[174]That was some kiss.                                    * \n[175] \n[176]... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.

Is it safe to talk? \n[3]I can't talk long.  Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow?  I must see you. \n[4]The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you. \n[5]Are you sure you weren't followed? \n[6]Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal... I may have to leave suddenly. \n[7]It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust. \n[8]Ssshhh!  We say Op.

See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this. \n[14]I'm sorry, I can't. \n[15]I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things. \n[16]It's strange.

Beirut's a great place if you know the city.                            * Listen, this isn't a secure line. I'll tell you all about it when I get back tomorrow... if I live. Scared?  Never!

It takes a little practice, but there's no way around it. \n[26]See, it's not just the car, it's a total image.  An identity you have to go for.  This isn't some high-tech sports car...  it doesn't even handle that great. But that's not the idea, is it. \n[27]What're we talking about here? Pussy, right? \n[28]Well then this is a vital piece of equipment.  Used properly, it can change your life.  See, you cruise.  No racing.  This ain't a Ferrari.  You check out the scenery, let the scenery check you out.  You got to take it slow.  Old cars are like good women... they heat up fast. \n[29]Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle. \n[30]It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are. \n[31]Sorry.  Trade secret. \n[32]Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them. \n[33]Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours. \n[34]Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios. \n[35]Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower. \n[36]Dickless.  If they took care of                        * business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean? \n[37]I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great. \n[38]Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk. \n[39]And she could be so hot, if she wanted to be.  She's like a dying plant that just needs a little water. \n[40]Red hot.  Her thighs steam. \n[41] \n[42]See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork? \n[43]Because it's you. \n[44]Nothing from Simon? \n[45]Helen.  I need your help.  Can you meet me tonight? \n[46]It's serious.  That's all I can                        * say.  Just meet on K Street under                      * the Key Bridge.

You should keep your head down until we're out of the city. \n[49]My place in the city is too hot right now.  So is the penthouse in New York.  But this place is secure. \n[50]  \n[51]To our assignment. \n[52]Helen, I want you to be my wife. \n[53] \n[54]Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days. \n[55]Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable. \n[56]You are incredibly brave.  I have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling.  I've lived like this for years, so I'm used to it.  Every day when I get up, I think it might be my last.  But it makes you appreciate life. And the moment.  Because that may be all you have. \n[57]To pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other.  The enemy can spot a fake easily. \n[58]You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax. \n[59]Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role. \n[60]There you go.  That's right... \n[61]If not for me, do it for democracy. \n[62]   \n[63]   \n[64] \n[65]Thank you.  You saved my life.

Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your-- \n[71]-- face.  Shit!  Shit!! \n[72]It's you!  Hey, you still interested in that Vette at all? \n[73]No... I sell cars.  That's all! Not even foreign cars.  Nothing international, I swear.  I'm no terrorist.  Everything I said was a lie... you have to believe me. I'm actually a complete coward. If I ever even saw a gun I'd-- \n[74]-- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me. I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm navel lint.  I have to lie to women to get laid.  And I don't score much.  It's pathetic. See, look... would a spy pee himself? \n[75]No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me. \n[76]Please don't.  You can have the car for free-- ", "Faisil": "\n[1]Affirmatory.
