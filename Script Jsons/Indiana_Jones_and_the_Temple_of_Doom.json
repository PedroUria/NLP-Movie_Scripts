Somebody tried to slit my throat. \n[6]It was dark, but I think one of your sons tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him. \n[7]Next time I'll cut off more than his finger. \n[8]As I recall the deal was consid- erably more. \n[9]Put the gun away, sonny. \n[10]Now I suggest you pay me what you promised -- or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune. \n[11]Try again Lao -- the deal was more. \n[12]Bingo...you see, Lao, with a but of persuasion, even you can be an honest fellow. \n[13]What's that? \n[14]Inside are the remains of Nur- hachi -- the first Emperor of the Manchu Dynasty. \n[15]Now what about the antidote, Lao. \n[16]Let go of her, Lao.  And give me the antidote. \n[17] \n[18]No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao. \n[19]Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm going to get you out of here. \n[20]The antidote -- ! \n[21]Look out, damn it, I need that antidote! \n[22]Hey,doll!  Don't move! \n[23] \n[24]If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her... \n[25]Step on it, Short Round! \n[26]Relax, I've been giving him lessons. \n[27]Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote? \n[28]Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge! \n[29]Somehow I think you've got bigger problems. \n[30]There, Shorty!  Through the tunnel! \n[31]The airport...No, look out, Short Round!  Left, left! \n[32] \n[33] \n[34]Siam. \n[35]Thanks, Weber. \n[36]Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll? \n[37]Oh yeah? \n[38] \n[39]No. Do you? \n[40] \n[41]Get over here, damn it!  Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight! \n[42]Okay, Shorty. \n[43]You all right? \n[44]India... \n[45]He told me they knew I was coming here. \n[46]The old man saw it in a dream. \n[47]He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down. \n[48]That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too... \n[49]We'd appreciate that.  This was an unexpected detour.  We'll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight west. \n[50]I'm a professor.  I have to re- turn to the university.  Can you give us a guide to take us to Delhi? \n[51]Thank you. \n[52] \n[53]Hasn't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857? \n[54]I don't understand.  What's hap- pened here? \n[55]What evil? \n[56]It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village. \n[57] \n[58]It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story. \n[59]Was the stone very smooth? It was probably brought here from a sacred river. \n[60]And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe.  I've seen stones like the one you lost. \n[61]But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone? \n[62] \n[63] \n[64] \n[65] \n[66]I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. \n[67]The English authorities who con- trol this area are the only ones who can help you. \n[68]I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this... \n[69]It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed... \n[70]   \n[71]Sankara... \n[72]Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've got to move out! \n[73]Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. \n[74]All right, let's go.  I want to get to Pankot before tomorrow night. \n[75]Those aren't birds -- those are giant bats. \n[76]I think maybe we'll camp here. \n[77]Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now. \n[78]Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. \n[79]Don't worry, I'm coming in!  What is it? \n[80]A what...? \n[81]Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea. \n[82]First of all -- don't panic! \n[83]Don't let it pull you deeper! \n[84]Don't let it curl around you! \n[85]Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what I tell you now. \n[86]Can you move your arm? \n[87]Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake. \n[88]Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal verte- brae. \n[89]Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet it! \n[90]Keep stroking it! \n[91]What's happening? \n[92]That's good  -- you're doing fine. \n[93]See -- I got you out... \n[94](looking at \n[95]I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. \n[96]Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai.  He was living on the streets. \n[97]By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? \n[98]What about the future? \n[99]I'd like to find one of those myself. \n[100]Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory... \n[101]Maybe... \n[102]Something that kid gave me last night.  It's a piece of an old manuscript. \n[103]The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago. \n[104]It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva. \n[105]Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil.  To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers. \n[106]It could be. \n[107]I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety. \n[108]Couldn't keep away, huh? \n[109] \n[110]Honey, I knew you'd be the first one to give in... \n[111]You're going to start something I'm going to have to finish. Okay, doll, you asked for it. \n[112]That's it.  Pankot Palace. \n[113]Just a statue. \n[114]He said he couldn't take us any farther.  He has to go sell the elephants. \n[115]Any more complaints? \n[116]It doesn't feel like there's been any permanent damage. \n[117]Hello?...... \n[118] \n[119]We'd appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morn- ing. \n[120]You look like a princess. \n[121] \n[122]No.  But I am interested in the occult.  And this is a krtya. \n[123]It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa.  The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him. \n[124]You think so? \n[125]You're hanging on better here than you did in America. \n[126]The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive. \n[127]Maybe he likes older women. \n[128]Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way. \n[129]We are honored to be here. \n[130]I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini- ster.  I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts. \n[131]Yes, very fine.  But not all of the pieces look old.  Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali. \n[132]I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard. \n[133]Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- becuase of some ancient evil. \n[134] \n[135]You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them. \n[136]Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore. \n[137]Something magical.  A sacred rock. \n[138]When they lost this rock their fields and animals dies.  They also said their children were taken from them. \n[139] \n[140] \n[141]That was a misunderstanding. \n[142] \n[143]Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are... \n[144]We're guests here, Shorty. \n[145]You wish is my command, your Highness. \n[146]Okay, Short Round, let go of it. \n[147]The Turks say that a whip can be an enemy even to its owner.  If you get some rope, it'll be easier to learn with, your Highness. Now, I think we'll say goodnight. \n[148]You don't like him do you? \n[149]No. \n[150]He was afraid of you.  He knows a tough  guy when he sees one. \n[151]I better see how Willie is. \n[152]I brought you something. \n[153]No -- real food. \n[154] \n[155] \n[156]And mating customs... \n[157]You're taling to an authority in that area. \n[158]You want me so bad, why don't you invite me? \n[159]I think you're too used to get- ting you own way, Willie... \n[160]Don't catch cold. \n[161]You're dreaming, Willie.  You want to make it real, just knock on my door. \n[162]  \n[163]  \n[164]Five minutes... fat chance. \n[165]  \n[166] \n[167]   \n[168]Okay, Shorty ... see you in the morning...I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie. \n[169]            \n[170]It's okay, it's over -- go turn off the fan. \n[171]This a cheap trick to get me over here? \n[172]What -- the bug? \n[173]Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that! \n[174] \n[175]*(He reads aloud an inscription in Sanskrit). \n[176] \n[177]*(He repeats aloud the inscrip- tion also written on the cloth \n[178]Lock your door and don't leave until we get back. \n[179]You're right, there's something all over the floor... \n[180]We'll have to crawl. \n[181]There's a chamber here.  Come on -- \n[182]Damn! \n[183]Yes, we're in here... \n[184]Uh -- Willie?! Willie, you better get down here! \n[185]Willie, come here!  Hurry up, we're in trouble!! \n[186]Willie, damn it!  Get down here, \n[187]\n[188]Move, Willie!  Faster! \n[189]Willie, open the door!  GET US \n[190]GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and listen!  There's got to be a ful- crum release!  Look around! \n[191]A fulcrum release lever! \n[192]Look around, Willie!  There's got to be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come on, you can do it! \n[193]That's it -- the release lever -- look inside! \n[194]Reach inside! \n[195]The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW! \n[196]Willie! \n[197]Not that one!  We had enought of that one, thank you... \n[198]It's a Thuggee ceremony.  They're whorshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction. \n[199]No...the heart's still beating! \n[200]Quiet! \n[201]The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones... \n[202]Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow. \n[203]Okay -- now listen -- you wait here and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an eye on her. \n[204]I'm going down. \n[205]I'm not leaving without those stones. \n[206] \n[207]Why? \n[208]What is that? \n[209] \n[210]Two are still missing. \n[211]That's what you've got these chil- dren -- these slaves digging for? \n[212]Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination. \n[213] \n[214]It's okay.  You're all right now. \n[215]Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a real tropper.  Willie? \n[216]You've got to go to sleep now. \n[217]I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vaca- tion... \n[218]I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me. \n[219]When she saw the insects she passed out cold.  I carried her back to her room.  She was sleeping when I re-entered the tunnel to look around. \n[220]Then she must have run out of the room and you found her. \n[221]Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That tunnel's been deserted for years. \n[222]Thanks, but I don't think Willie is ready to travel yet. \n[223]Yes. \n[224]Yes, they believe you. \n[225]No... they won't kill me. \n[226]You won't lose me, Willie... \n[227]No!  I've found it -- you can't -- Kali knows! \n[228]-- been too many lies -- there's no god's heaven -- just -- the horror! I've seen it -- life preying on life! \n[229]-- rivers -- destroying mountains -- a comet in space -- exploding! Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful people -- their pain -- the hate -- and greed -- always greed! \n[230]-- but I've found -- Kali's touch! Death -- no more lies -- the death I've been searching for! Quit crying!  She can hear you -- Kali knows fear -- don't you under- stand -- Kali is freedom! \n[231]Yes, I understand. \n[232]Kali Ma protects us now and for- ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood! \n[233]No!  Give him to me! \n[234]Come on, quick! \n[235]We're going to get them out of here -- ! \n[236]And then we're going to get these out of here -- ! And somehow I'm going to see this place destroyed. \n[237]Ah, sir?  Excuse me -- \n[238]Listen, I'm from the union and I'd like to talk about the working conditions here.  Could you step inside a minute? \n[239]No, wait! \n[240]There's got to be another way out. \n[241]Those empty cars have got to go out of the mines. \n[242]Come on, let's see if we can catch a ride... \n[243]Okay, Shorty -- go! \n[244]Go! \n[245]We've got to get across to the empty cars.  Wait here until I signal you. \n[246]Come on! \n[247]Come one, what's wrong? \n[248]I see the problem... \n[249]Come here and take the brake! \n[250]Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks! \n[251]Let up on the brake! \n[252]Let her go!  Our only chance is outrunning them! \n[253]Get over on the other side! \n[254]One down, one to go! \n[255]Yeah -- this time you're gonna help! \n[256]Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW! \n[257]Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes! \n[258]Grab onto me -- I'm going to try and slow us down from underneath! \n[259]What's wrong? \n[260]Ouch... \n[261]There!

Climb up to the bridge! \n[264]Let my friends go! \n[265]That's far enough! \n[266]You want the stones, let them go and call off your guards! \n[267]Then I guess we're all going to take a big dive! \n[268]Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell! \n[269]You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re- peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn- ing \n[270]*(He repeats Sankara's warning \n[271]Not quite. \n[272]The last Sankara Stone. \n[273]Yes, I've seen its power \n[274]The last Sankara Stone. \n[275] \n[276]It's still a long way to Delhi.

But look at me -- my god, I've to to get ready! \n[99]It's sort of like being in heaven. \n[100] \n[101]Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's  wife? \n[102] \n[103]I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money.

Listen, you've got to help.  We found this tunnel -- \n[174]No -- you can't go!  Something aw- ful's happened.  They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been -- \n[175]We found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace!  Please, come with me, I'll show you! \n[176]I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out! \n[177]It's some kind of cult!  And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for. \n[178]What're you talking about -- I'm not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll show you! \n[179]  \n[180]Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them what happened, they won't believe me -- \n[181]They think I'm insane.  Tell them I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ... \n[182] \n[183] \n[184]    \n[185]Indy?  Did you walk to them? \n[186]So now they believe me. \n[187]Then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple... \n[188]I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you. \n[189] \n[190]Indy!

Finding that stone could've got- ten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about. \n[218]Oh no, I'm finding a native guide who knows the way.
