Apparently she was watching Sportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in a clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all directions, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see...  ...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head, an industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS..  ...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches INTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he hurries to stop the door before it slams in his face.  When she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever. Her laser glare. What the fuck do you want?  \n[2]I can't do this. \n[3]Hi, too.     That for me? \n[4]Where's our candy? \n[5]Petal went to Florida.       She'll be back soon. \n[6]So do you. \n[7]Nestor. \n[8]We found the turtle. And they found Nestor. Did you find Petal? \n[9]You never do. But she always comes back. \n[10]Don't worry. \n[11]I know why. \n[12]The green makes me hurl. Her, too. \n[13]Which one's Petal's room?   I'll sleep there. \n[14]This is important. \n[15]They're being nice and patient. \n[16]They look better this way.        They have great bodies. \n[17]I need it.     I look good in blue. \n[18]I need it. \n[19]Watch out for the dog. \n[20]I mean.     The white one! \n[21]The White Dog with the big teeth and the red eyes. The Skinny Ghost owns him. They came last night. \n[22]I didn't dream 'em, don't say I did. \n[23]Warren threw up in your sleeping bag. She's got a stomach problem. \n[24]It's called cancer. \n[25]What's wrong with him? \n[26]Know how to be a dog? \n[27]He looks fast to me. Maybe he's cured. \n[28] Bunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt. Obviously dad's. Her naked Barbies sit in a semi- circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers. Quoyle enters, and sits close beside her. Watches in silence, as she works.  \n[29]Warren died today. She's not coming back. \n[30]That's the difference. \n[31]You can watch. \n[32]You look better with 'em on. \n[33]Shhh. I'm teaching Herry to read. Just like I did Warren. \n[34]First is the teaching part.     The learning comes later. \n[35]Wavey? Now are the berries ready to pick? \n[36]Egg salad and Nehi grape. \n[37]They're mine but I'll share. \n[38]Then don't. Slow us. Down. \n[39]Why'd you leave the house open? \n[40]Can I keep the necklace? \n[41]When you gonna ask? \n[42]She's the worst one of all! \n[43]Herry told her he had to pee. But the way he talks. He could just say 'eeee,' like that. \n[44]She told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it. \n[45]She made him stand against the wall. \n[46]She wasn't hurt for real.     Just screamed like a baby. \n[47]Petal'll think so, too. \n[48]How? \n[49]That teacher. Is gonna forgive me? \n[50]Well.   I don't wanna forgive her. \n[51]I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey, I'm the only family Herry's got. \n[52]Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost. \n[53]The one who ties the knots?     You're \n[54]You said. \n[55]Daddy.   The Green House is gone. \n[56]I didn't dream it. Don't say I did. \n[57]Petal's things. \n[58]I think they're all here. \n[59]What's wrong? \n[60]Will she be proud to wear 'em? \n[61]He's okay.     He's not sleeping in the box. \n[62]If he's not sleeping.     Why do they call it a awake? \n[63]He looks like he's sleeping. \n[64]Petal's peaceful, too. \n[65]See.   He woke up. \n[66]That's a funny thing to say.   For the first thing he said. \n[67]Well.     The world's not fair.     You said. \n[68]There was only two. \n[69]I got a box of 'em.   You could pick one. \n[70]Then you'd have everything you need. \n[71]No. ", "Quoyle": "\n[1]Ruined. \n[2]If you're shocked when someone aims kindness your way. That oughta tell you somethin' about yourself. \n[3]Then again. If you're that kinda guy. It don't. \n[4]Uh.   No thanks. \n[5]How could I be? \n[6]I think my brother said that once. \n[7]Maybe it was my father. \n[8]I'm not a water person. \n[9]So we should cut it. \n[10]Or you could tie me in a sack, throw me in the river. Tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard. \n[11]Does your wife like special pickles? They're fine with cold cuts. \n[12]Seven and a half month anniversary? \n[13]You're havin' a baby! \n[14] Petal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed. Draws the covers back.  Stares.  \n[15]It was pretty much like that for a month. \n[16]Somewhere in there. We got married. \n[17]After that, I had to follow her to see her. \n[18]Which I know was wrong of me. \n[19]She didn't know she was pregnant. \n[20]Uh.    Where are y... \n[21]Come home.     I'll make you one. \n[22]You okay?     Except for being thirsty? \n[23]Ounce Southern Comfort, ounce Sloe Gin. Ounce Triple Sec. Three ounces o.j.... \n[24]Me too.    I'll tell Bunny you miss her. \n[25]There's.    Cold chicken. \n[26]I knew we had our problems. But I never thought I'd hear that word. \n[27]I knew if I could take it. In the end. It would all work out. \n[28]Brain tumor and liver cancer. One apiece. \n[29]Dicky.   It's Mom and Poppa.    They. \n[30]So.     For the funeral, I thou... \n[31]Well.     Mom'll be there, too. \n[32]Don't see how. Big mortgage. Spent their savings on the doctors. I hadda send some grocery mon... \n[33]Sorry, Ed. I gotta drive down to my parents' place. I'll be back, Friday. \n[34]In what sense do you m... \n[35]Uh.   Would next week be better? \n[36]Should I finish the sawmill piece? \n[37] Quoyle enters carrying a spray of violets.     HEAR Springer turned up loud. He goes to the parlor to find...  ...MRS. MOOSUP, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi. She is mean-ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms. She stares at him, the flowers.  \n[38]They're for Petal, Mrs. Moosup. I got something to tell her. \n[39]That's the last thing she'd ev... \n[40]At least she took her toys.       Wanted her to be happy. \n[41]Yes.     I need to report a kidnapping. \n[42]Quoyle. Q-U-O-Y-L-...no, Y, then L-E. Yeh, it's my kid. \n[43] Quoyle alone in absolute darkness. Bumping around the house. There's a large bag of something in one hand, maybe M &amp; Ms. But he's not eating. Just murmuring to himself...  \n[44]  \n[45] Quoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man underwater. A room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through the window. He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed photos. Lifts one...  ...a BOY of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond. Stocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes. Next to him, not touching, a GIRL, big for 12. Rawboned, husky. Flat gaze, like something's dead or hidden.  Quoyle walks to the table. A cardboard box has been filled with mementos. A slip of paper: AGNIS HAMM, a telephone number. The phone is RINGING now. Quoyle staring at the paper. Finally, lifts the phone, breathes an absent greeting, and...  \n[46]He's not here. \n[47]He's passed on. He's dead. You said Mockingb... \n[48]Are you a detective, Lieutenant? \n[49]Well, as you've probably deduced, I am his son. Cause I'm at his place. As alleged. \n[50]Which is...? \n[51]The good.     Please. \n[52]That's.     The good n... \n[53]And Petal...? \n[54]That don't mean for sure she w... \n[55]Yeh. If she was alive. Don't guess she'd a left that. \n[56]Me neither. \n[57]Hi. \n[58]In the store. That way, you've got the whole selection. \n[59]Give us a minute. \n[60]I mean him. \n[61]She had an accident. \n[62]There was a car crash, sweetie. And they found...you know, the body. Of her friend. \n[63]Petal can't come back, she's dead. You know dead. Like the turtle. \n[64] Quoyle stumbling toward the front door, drawing his robe around him. Squinting through the peephole. OPENING the door, to reveal...  \n[65]Uh. No, Bunny and I like to... uh, early to bed, earl... \n[66]I never knew her, really. \n[67]But she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand. She was a locked door. Even to me. \n[68]Some people probably thought Petal was bad clear through. \n[69]I think she just couldn't get enough love. \n[70]In what sense do you m... \n[71]Uh.     There's Mom.   And that's Poppa. \n[72]Those are temporary. \n[73]Like the falcon. \n[74]Well, that was my friend Partridge. Made the call. And it's just an interview. \n[75] The car pulls up in a shroud of mist. Our family climbs out, stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud, until...  ...the fog LIFTS. And like a ghost, a GREEN HOUSE appears.       Then, disappears. Then, APPEARS again. This time, to stay.  \n[76]Take it easy. Floor mighta fallen into the cellar. \n[77]Uh.     Why would they do th... \n[78]Is that a belt or a crown? \n[79]Sodas get flat withou... \n[80]That why the Barbies are watching? \n[81]They must be chilly, tho.     Should I get their clo... \n[82]Well.     I look good in shoes. \n[83]I was lookin' for that all over our old place. The landlady s... \n[84]You had quite the heavy morning. Take the rest of the day off. \n[85]Be right back, and we'll start talking breakf... \n[86]Yeh, her farts are pretty scary. \n[87]I was gonna say.     I'll keep my eyes peeled. \n[88]Be cheaper to build a new one. On the Riviera, even. \n[89]I'm not.     A water person. \n[90]...not a water person. \n[91]Someone found a pretty wife. \n[92]Someone always does. \n[93]That'd be me. The second one. \n[94]How'd the meeting go? Did they agree on a joint marketing approach? \n[95]Listen to this. 'Well, we see the postman has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor. He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a dip and help themselves.' \n[96]This is great stuff. 'A snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home from what the Widow Puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. A well- known accordion player, Mr. Puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. Bet they aren't crying, either.' This Billy Pretty can really write! \n[97]From what? \n[98]I'm not buyin'. No boat. \n[99]Buggit, huh? Any kin to my boss on the Gammy Bird? \n[100]Headline.     Dog Fart Fells Freelance Reporter.     Promising Career Nipped in Bud. \n[101] Ouoyle JUMPS a foot.   Looks from Card to Billy to Nutbeem.    What's going on?  \n[102]Based on my I.Q. test, huh.   Where'd I rate? \n[103]So he said. Waitin' for his license. \n[104]Mr. Buggit. I'm not.     Well, a water person. \n[105]Him and Jack. Tell it. \n[106]And that's enough t...? \n[107]Man's a witch. \n[108]Say it fast. \n[109]I'll drink to that. \n[110]Hullo.     It's our first day, and I \n[111]Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? There's nothing wr... \n[112]Which one of those women is in charge here? \n[113]Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention. \n[114]I mean, children need structure. No one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt. \n[115]Um.   I write for the newspa... \n[116]Well, I was just... \n[117]She has wonderful.     Posture. \n[118]No sir, your wife is very lovl... \n[119]Oh, yessir. He was in all the papers. Way back. \n[120]So. What brings you folks up from Long Island? \n[121]Oh.   My.    God. \n[122]You are a woman of mystery, Aunt. Mystery and surprise. \n[123]You said upholstery.   Never said yacht uphol... \n[124]Where's Bunny? \n[125]What does that mean? \n[126]Little early in the day f... \n[127]Poor old girl. \n[128]I never thought so. \n[129]Another necklace, huh?    Can I help? \n[130]Do I have to take my clothes off? \n[131]You know.    You do look good in blue. \n[132]Give you folks a lift? \n[133]Well. My aunt can't bring Bunny to the daycare, she's got her shop now. But I worked it out with my boss. So I'll be bringin' her come next week. \n[134]If that's all right. \n[135]Only the best ones. \n[136]So the Newfie drills another hole in the ice, aways off from the first one. Once again, the voice booms, \n[137]  They don't look at each other.      Poker-faced, just alike, working side by side.  \n[138]The Newfie looks around. Still nobody. Hollers, WHO ARE YA? THE VOICE O' GOD? Voice comes back, NO! THE ARENA MANAGER! \n[139]Heard it before, huh? \n[140]You guys hungry? \n[141]Is he learnin'? \n[142]Said it was. \n[143]Well.   A boat's a boa... \n[144]Thanks. \n[145]That goes with the shipping news. Profile of a vessel in port. \n[146]That's the one I didn't do. Mrs. Diddolate sprained her wrist.

Reporter Disembowels Self With Rusty Joke. \n[151]Jack, I completely understand, I would fire me, too. \n[152]In a heartbeat. \n[153]You give me a chance, and what happens? I buy the wrong boat, I write the wrong story, I am the lowest form of alleged life. In fact, your comment... \n[154]  Hear now what the hammering had masked. Someone is reaching the top of the ladder, climbing onto the roof.  Bunny. Somehow she has managed to climb while carrying a sandwich on a plate. And an open bottle of soda. He stares at her, uncomprehending.  \n[155]Baby... \n[156]\n[157]We're gonna play Wait For Daddy. Can you play that? \n[158]And if you don't move.     Until I get there. Then... \n[159]...then you win! \n[160]That.     Was so easy. \n[161]Thing about the barge piece? I just thought it'd perk up th... \n[162]Goin' fishin'? \n[163]Thirty-eight years. First time anybody said you done it right. \n[164]I just, uh, came to see if you'd heard abou.. \n[165]That's.    That's just terrible. \n[166] PULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along. He holds the string of a big, glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter. As she watches the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask...  \n[167]Do you think Bunny's. Strange? \n[168]In New York. They said she had a... personality disorder. \n[169]All these hallucin... \n[170]You know how many she makes? \n[171]And she's saving her mother a room. Did she tell you that? \n[172]  Very quiet now.    The wind.     The kites.  \n[173]You know how kids think.       You have all those books. \n[174]Just.     Is she okay? \n[175]I mean.     If you had to guess.. \n[176]\n[177]  \n[178]I understand. Believe m... \n[179]I'm thinking I'm sorry.     For everything. \n[180]Cindy Crawford and me is doin' fine. \n[181]  \n[182]Bunny I guess. Weavin' a daisy-chain necklace. \n[183]Well. She does have that posture goin'. \n[184]There is now. \n[185]  The old man's face just stops.     The eyes sharpen.   Into a question.  \n[186]Well, you said. There's no one else. \n[187]Hey. If you wanna rest next to him. I'll paint yours at the same time. No extra trouble. \n[188]Attaway, girl. You're smarter'n all of us. \n[189]More obvious. Than the wife? \n[190]Okay, where's the wife? Agnis kill her too? \n[191]...so there they were, this goofy old codger and his dog, big as life. \n[192]Here I was worried about Bunny night and day, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with her. \n[193]Her only problem is her dad worries too mu... \n[194]So what is th... \n[195]Well. I've been workin' longer hours. So Dennis and Beety were kind enough to bring Bunny to the daycare. Fed her a lotta meals, too. They're real friends. \n[196]Nobody Hangs a Picture of an Oil Tanker. That's the header. \n[197]There's a 1904 photo hung in the library. Eight schooners heading out to fishing grounds, sails spread it like white wings. Beautiful. Beyond compare. \n[198]More common today is the low black profile of oil tankers. Like the ruptured Golden Goose, which last week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto seabirds, fish and boats at Cape Despond. \n[199]There will be more and more tankers. They will grow old and corroded, and their tanks will split. They have already done to fishing. What their spill has done to fish. \n[200]Nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker. On their wall. \n[201]Well.     Whatcha think? \n[202]Well, sure. \n[203]Run it.   Like I wrote it. \n[204]Like I wrote it. \n[205]Sweetie.     Come sit in the car. \n[206]\n[207]  Card just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk.       Hands one toward Quoyle...  \n[208]More than 3000 tankers proudly ride the world's seas. Even the biggest take advantage of Newfoundland's deep- water ports and refineries. \n[209]Oil and Newfoundland go together like ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs they'll nourish us in the coming years. \n[210]Let's all hang a picture of an oil tanker. On our wall. \n[211]How can a man resign.    To nobody? \n[212]I know the word, Card. It means you two deserve each other. \n[213]Jack's gone fishing? \n[214]Headline. Reporter Becomes Magnet For Dead Men. \n[215]What was my panic? He was already dead. Maybe I thought, in some dim way... \n[216]...if it wasn't too late for him. It wouldn't be for Petal. \n[217]Once I was past the shelter of the lee shore, and into the real wind. I realized my mistake. \n[218]Headline.    Reporter Becomes Anchor Man. \n[219]Stupid. Stupid to drown with Bunny so young. No life jacket, no floating oar. No sense. \n[220]And I wondered. Am I going where she's gone? \n[221]...and will I see her? \n[222]You don't smoke. \n[223]You don't have to, I'm all right. I'm in heaven. \n[224]Nice.   You sittin' up with me. \n[225]Who you worried ab... \n[226]I asked.   Who you worried about? \n[227]Not really. Wouldn't be right. \n[228]And she talked about it.      Just like that. \n[229]So we're patient. And we wait, and we're good to her. And. Maybe. Time. \n[230]Well, hurry up. Thirty, forty years I'll be rarin' to get back out on the water. \n[231]Uh. Wavey? If it's all the same to you... \n[232]When you're in the mood. \n[233]She musta done something.     Really bad. \n[234]See, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong. You coulda hurt her bad. I guess you know that. \n[235]Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds funny. \n[236]Well, there won't be any trouble at school. I'II take care of that. \n[237]Because the best thing about people. Is they can forgive each other. I heard that this morning. \n[238]That. And she won't want the story printed in the paper. \n[239]Me neither. \n[240]\n[241]Uncle. My daughter Bunny and I. We got you some hot bread. And some meat. Some dried fish. Some squash and vegetables...a cake...some warm clothes... \n[242]You tied those knots, huh?

Someday, I'd do something nice for you? \n[256]Hey. Overnight trip to St. John's. All expenses paid. \n[257]Now, listen to this for t'morrow. After I sign the papers at the home... \n[258]The answer to your annual outing! Rainbow trout fishing in four ponds. You pay for what you catch. Prizes in the ponds. If it drizzles or gets chilly, heated and lighted building available, right next to the ponds, with soft drinks, candy bars, ice cream and chips! \n[259]Hey, it's my treat.     You agreed. \n[260]A friend told me once. Love is the only thing that counts. \n[261]It's the engine of life. \n[262]So when you told me how you think about your husband. I really understood, becau... \n[263]...because real love.     Just comes once. \n[264]See, you know some of the stories about Petal. Some of the bad things. What you don't know... \n[265]Sorta.    Because of it. \n[266]See, love. Isn't about what's good for you. Isn't about what you wish it was. Isn't about what...would make you happy. \n[267]Love. Is about want. What you really want. And you can't change that. Even if it's poison. \n[268]So that's why it's great. To have a real friend. When you're. Lonely. \n[269]I cou... \n[270]She did stay my friend. In her way. Even tho, for awhile, we didn't see each other a lot. \n[271]Funny. How one little talk.      Can change everything. \n[272]Tell me about it. Just get the aunt's house fixed perfect, and I gotta move. \n[273]Three hours to drive from the Point, with all the ice. Alvin won't have my boat ready til New Years. Agnis can stay over her shop. Bunny and I have to find a room in town. \n[274]  \n[275]Be careful. \n[276]Last friend left me.

'Bout what? \n[288]Well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou... \n[289]Well, Billy'll do a helluva job... \n[290]Course.

It's a copy. \n[298]It's nice for your eyes.     I thought. \n[299]It's for everyday. You don't have to save it for special. \n[300]You must have me mistaken. For a writer. \n[301]It was so big, I thought it was a tea cozy for your car. But if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh? \n[302]You kiddin'? After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it. \n[303]Not used to a woman.     Giving me presents. \n[304]One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up. \n[305]She didn't have anything for me. Like every year. But this one time, she said, 'Wait a minute.' \n[306]She ran to the kitchen. I heard the fridge open. She came back. With her hands hidden behind her. Then, she held out... \n[307]Two brown eggs. She gave them to me from her own hands. They were cold. \n[308]Must sound really stupid.   But they meant a lot to me. \n[309]I broke 'em, careful. Made her an omelette with 'em. And I saved the shells. In a little box. \n[310]Oh, yeh. They're on a shelf behind my desk. At the paper. \n[311]Well. I gotta collect Bunny. Beety's gonna have supper waiting. \n[312]Well.   Merry Christmas! \n[313]I'll say.    She's as good as mine. \n[314]Mavis Bangs.

Driving a nice Lexus. \n[318]Says she did it all for love. \n[319]Some women. Shoulda done it to their brother. \n[320]Mavis said you buried Warren here. Called it an anniversary. \n[321]I don't know. We just do. \n[322]For some, it does. \n[323]Y'know what the feathers around here need th' most? A good ruffling, I say. \n[324]Y'know what I need th' most? \n[325]A really big breakfast! \n[326]Hey.     Congratulations. \n[327]  Shakes his head with innocent admiration.       She puts the bottle on his desk.  \n[328]I'll drink with you. If you're not done yet. \n[329]I take pride in that. \n[330] They climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight. Stare in wonder at the naked rock. The snapped, spent, cables. Only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the cliff.  Bunny RUNS toward the debris, and through it.     To a tangle of bushes near the cliff.  He walks to a broken cable. Crouches. His eyes running over the space. Where his ancestor's home once stood. And then. He turns...  \n[331]What you got there? \n[332]They're beautiful. I never saw 'em. All together. \n[333]Well.    Any woman would. \n[334]You knew Billy's dad? \n[335]Remember what I told you. \n[336]We're the ones have to be awake. To how much we love him... \n[337]And how we should be good to each other. While we have the chance. \n[338]You think? \n[339]That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles. \n[340]I found this in Jack's drawer at the paper.

It's a Quoyle tradition. \n[345]Thanks.   For the mirror. \n[346]What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster license'? \n[347]Maybe he just said it. To make your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard. You think? \n[348]It's not fair, is it. That Jack woke up. And Petal didn't. \n[349]That's something the world is always teaching us. And sometimes, the learning comes later. \n[350]You taught me that. \n[351]You know. What we wait for? It's like the main stem of this boat. It gives us our shape. \n[352]See, I know why you saved a place for Petal. All this time. \n[353]Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn how to do. By watching me. \n[354]You just watched.

And don't ferget the camera. \n[33]I fergot somethin'. \n[34]You pinko Greepeace sack a quivering pigfat. \n[35]Did I leave out moosebutt-ugly? You may go. \n[36]S'tell me.     Yer fancy it? \n[37]Yer column's front page stuff. Only now, it's more like a caption, is all. \n[38]Spelled everthin' perfect.     So as not t'embarrass yer. \n[39]Even put yer name on it. \n[40]Man a yer principles. I unnerstan' resignation is th'only honorable course. \n[41]If yer off to see Jack Buggit, yer'll hafta swim some. \n[42]Yer can whine an' beg t'him.     But I \n[43]An' if yer think he's gonna choose you over fishin'...yer not as smart as even you look! \n[44]Me an' Jack. Has a sym-bi-otic relationship. Yer can look that up. \n[45]\n[46]So.    This is what Jack and I think. \n[47]We wanna run Quoyle's oil spill piece b'cause controversy sells papers and papers sells ads. \n[48]And we're gonna let Quoyle have his head on these columns, up to 500 words. So he'll get his confidence up. \n[49]But we wanna expand his responsi- bilities to boat crashes. There's maybe four a week. \n[50]And.   The oil tanker picture.   Stays! \n[51]All that clear? \n[52]One more thing... ", "Wavey": "\n[1] Quoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon. A small house, its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures, galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with crafts, ignored by...  ...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled, unbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are trying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree...  ...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in the rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced SON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair.  Quoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As we arrive, the woman looks up...  \n[2]I'm Wavey Prowse, and this is my place. Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun. \n[3]Oh, yeh.     Running with sharp objects?     We save for Tuesdays. \n[4]We're enjoyin' the walk, thank you. \n[5]Love to have her. I'm sorry, Mr. Quoyle, about the other time. Women can be moody, you know. And temperamental. \n[6]Good afternoon, Dennis. Give our respects to Beety and Marty. \n[7] Daycare in progress. The comfy parlor has been given over to the kids. A wall of Polaroids of each child faces a map of Newfoundland with drawings of moose, caribou, and lobster. Little Herry sits alone in a doorway, watching with big eyes as...  ...Quoyle, Bunny astride his back, RAMPAGES around the parlor on all fours, SNORTING like a crazed boar. The kids are squealing, delighted, making excited little runs at him, swatting him with throw pillows and rolled-up sweaters. Thrill of the hunt.  Wavey comes through the doorway, drying her hands, just behind where her boy sits. Quoyle doesn't see her, he's thrashing and bellowing, lost in the game. She watches, for a long beat. Then leans down to Herry.  \n[8]Go on.    Get the pig. \n[9] CLOSE on Quoyle.     He is happily washing a mountain of dishes and cups.  \n[10]Sometimes, passion in performance. Beats the element of surprise. \n[11]Almost. Almost ready.       You know, it's all about timing. \n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]And it was named Petal. \n[16]The White Dog. Sometimes with the Skinny Ghost. Kids do things like that, it's called imagination. Like the necklaces. \n[17]It's a skill, she's proud of it. And she brings her dolls along. And she looks good in blue. And she wears a key for a good luck charm. \n[18]The ones I read to teach Herry. They don't make me an exp... \n[19]That child is the only friend my son ever had. So she's strange, you bet. \n[20]I love that little girl. And I will see to it. That she's all right. \n[21]And I don't have to guess about it. \n[22]Look.    I like you. \n[23]I want us.     To be friends, okay? \n[24]And friends. Need.       To understand each other. \n[25]My husband drowned.      Herry was... \n[26]He was two months old. And Herold took the boat out. Overnight. To fish for haddock. \n[27]Because I liked.     Haddock. \n[28]It's four years. \n[29]And it's yesterday. \n[30]Now, did I blow it.     Or can you still be my friend? \n[31]What?    What are you thinking? \n[32] ANGLE...brightly lit kitchen. Bunny sits at the little table, a large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little Herry at her side. They are watching Freakazoid on a tiny TV. Bunny shovels in a mouthful of popcorn. Then makes a sage, if unintelligible, comment about the show to Herry. Still chewing, she takes another huge handful of popcorn...  ...Herry opens his mouth like a baby bird. Bunny stuffs the snack in. It's a stare-and-chew, side by side. Just alike.  ANGLE...cozy parlor. Quoyle sits in a Barca-lounger with a huge bowl of chips in his lap. He is watching hockey on a modest TV, the action is fierce. Stuffs his mouth full of chips, yet somehow manages to say...  \n[33]That'd be old Nolan. He's actually your uncle, last of the crazy Quoyles. I should have realized. \n[34]Sad, really. Lives like a hermit in a run-down shack. No one to look after h... \n[35]You are a loving and wonderful father. You're not the problem. \n[36]Nice to see you. \n[37]...after all this time. \n[38]I thought you forgot. That I'm your friend, too. \n[39]You want another sandwich?    There's roast pork. \n[40]You said.    You'd read me your article. \n[41]I think when Card sees it, he'll split a gut. I think he'll sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back. I think he'll never stop until you're fired. \n[42]I think I haven't been so proud. Of a friend. Since I don't know when. \n[43]Maybe another sandwich. There's roast pork. \n[44]Actually.    It's just my bed. \n[45]Actually, it's not. I just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that. \n[46]Only when I'm worried.      I don't worry much. \n[47]I'm not worried.    About you. \n[48]  She glances to the nightstand. Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture of Jack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing.  \n[49]Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was still with me. The kids are camped out in the parlor. \n[50]S'okay. Someday you'll do somethin' nice for me. \n[51]You didn't find a second dead man. Just the rest of the first one. \n[52]You said Bunny talks to Petal at night. You ever listen? \n[53]Well, I'm not that nice a person. \n[54]She plays Petal. Talks to the Barbies, like Petal talking to her. \n[55]She says she's sorry she left them. It was just to see if they could be good girls. And they were... \n[56]...and she loves them. \n[57]The Barbies look better naked, Bunny looks good in blue, guess who said that? \n[58]So we talked. Just before Petal left her with that...stranger? Bunny had snapped her mom's bead necklace. That's why she's making more. \n[59]When she's made enough.     She'll be forgiven. \n[60]She saves Petal a room at the house, but she's also got the key to the old place. In case her mom would rather go there. \n[61]Sure, I lied. I said nice things about her mother. \n[62]See, there's only one problem. Petal isn't gone. \n[63]I think Bunny and I. Should take a walk. \n[64] CLOSE on Wavey, cooking flapjacks.      Talking to them.  \n[65]Only you.     Could do this. \n[66]You fed him. You gave him clothes. You're the first human ever was kind to him... \n[67]Accordingly. You're sick with guilt. \n[68]You sure you're not a complex guy? \n[69]That's what that is! \n[70]One decent golden age home. It's in St. John's. You can maybe afford it, tho God knows why you should. \n[71]Great!      Let's not be rash! \n[72]Why.   Would I. Do that? \n[73]What's wrong with a weekend? \n[74]Or we could sleep in. \n[75]I just feel so guilty about all your expenses. Two separate rooms. Both so big. \n[76]Still. Seems like we could figure out. Something. \n[77]That's what I wanted us to talk abou... \n[78]...is how much you love her. \n[79]Even tho.    She never loved you. \n[80]I know you have to stay tomorrow. To sign the papers. But. \n[81]I should be heading back. Before Herry. Misses me. Too much. \n[82]And I'm not feeling so well. What I get for mixing vodka and beer, huh. \n[83]So I'll grab a taxi. You stay and finish. Listen to the music. Is that all right? \n[84]And don't worry.     I'm still your friend. \n[85] Knitted wool, the color of oxblood, lies across a timeworn leather ottoman. In front of it, little Herry dances a shuffle-foot jig of his own design. The music seeps from a venerable accordian, played earnestly by his serious mom, nodding and tapping her foot to the time of his steps.  There is a feeling of empowerment and release in Herry. His grin splits his round face. His eyes say that his heart is dancing.  PULL SLOWLY BACK...through the window, past the porch, across the front yard. To a figure. By the fence. He stands motionless. Except his foot is tapping, very slightly, to the time of the music.  We can't tell how much Quoyle sees.    But his eyes say that his heart is drowning.  \n[86] The day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as...  ...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking lights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade by these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway.  Mixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least visit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with him, so he strolls on into...  ...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him. A friend's smile.  \n[87]Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't have! \n[88]Oh, I'm much too excited. \n[89]It is my favorite teapot. \n[90]Oh, I'll save this, all right. \n[91]And I'll think of you.     When I \n[92]I don't make mistakes.     About that kind of thing. \n[93]Well, you can't be surprised. You've seen me knitting it for months. \n[94]Well.   You'll grow into it. \n[95]Well.   It's the thought that counts. \n[96]I know how it is. To hold onto something good. In the middle of all the bad. \n[97]Thank you.     Thank you, very much. \n[98]Merry Christmas. \n[99]We all know Billy Pretty's ways. Never save fifty cents, if you can save a dollar. \n[100]Well, last Feb'ry, Billy wants t'get his grandfather clock repaired. Calls old Leander Mesher. Local call. No charge. \n[101]Well, says Leander, the big cost is pickup and delivery. Got t'charge fifty dollars, each way. Two strong boys. Gasoline. Air in the tires! \n[102]There's no cost for air in yer tires!, says Bill. Get wi' th'times, he's told. Tis called inflation! \n[103]Billy lives at the top of the hill, Leander at the bot tom, doncha know. So Billy gets a rope, HOISTS the grandfather UP on his back. And muttering the words fifty bucks... \n[104]Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice. \n[105]Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out in her non-slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip. Didn't yer, dearie? \n[106]Meanwhile, at the top... \n[107]...OVER he goes, clock-side down, and PICKIN' UP SPEED! \n[108]...eight blocks, NINE, missing everything like a miracle, zeroing in on... \n[109]CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank! \n[110]Just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow. She digs 'er way out. Brushes herself off. Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. She says... \n[111]\n[112]\n[113]Woulda been a thrill for the Christians among' em. They think you're dead. \n[114]So does your son. \n[115]You think so. \n[116]It was easy. I just kept thinkin'. How would Petal do it? \n[117]We're friends, right?     Friends drink together. \n[118]I asked a quest... \n[119]Not drunk enough yet to talk about Petal. Which we always seem to do. \n[120]Let's talk about me.     Which we don't. \n[121]Growin' up, all I wanted from this place was out. Imagine. Give up all this. \n[122]I ran off to Toronto, went to school. Wanted to be a social worker. For kids. \n[123]Came back one summer.     Fell for Herold Prowse. That.      Was that. \n[124]Did you know I was a liar? \n[125]Herold liked other women.     But you know how that is. \n[126]He didn't die. Not that he didn't deserve to. \n[127]See, I'm a good liar. \n[128]He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew. \n[129]Like I said. It's four years ago. And it's yesterday. \n[130]So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told my little story. Grieving widow. \n[131]I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate myself on the wayout? \n[132]But a funny thing happened.        On my way out. \n[133]All these funny, odd little folks? They put their hearts around me. So I wouldn't be alone. Having lost the man I loved. \n[134]And since I knew, to my shame, that is exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did. \n[135]Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks better than his mom. \n[136]You're quite the talker. \n[137]Well, this morning.     The man I loved. Came back. \n[138]Told me he knew.     I loved him still. \n[139]Okay. Now I'm drunk enough.         To talk about Petal. \n[140]You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. In love with our nightmares. \n[141]You don't love your Petal. You hate. Her cheating. Guts. \n[142]You have to think it's love. Because if it's not, you're dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it's all you'll ever have. \n[143]You see.   You're a good liar, too. \n[144]Where's the damn eggshells?     That's all I came to see. \n[145]Can you guess how I know about Petal? \n[146]Because you and I.   Are kindred souls. After all. \n[147]So I told my husband. To fuck himself. And the ego he rode in on. \n[148]Thanks for the mirror. \n[149]If I don't see you.   Happy New Year. \n[150]I'm thanking your daddy.     For all my presents. \n[151]More than two. Everything I need. Except... \n[152]Except a necklace. \n[153]You want the cheese? ", "Prowse": "\n[1]", "Silver": "\n[1]Tell them what happened.     In \n[2]\n[3]Now tell them. Who let our insurance lapse. \n[4]Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it. An inch from bankruptcy. \n[5]Moral of the story? When you marry a tour guide. Confine his authority to mixing the drinks. Same again, dear? \n[6]My dining salon needs refitting. And the best custom yacht upholsterer in the Northern Hemisphere just moved here. I was forced. To follow. ", "Jack": "\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]Advanced squirrel. This ties you with me, an' I own the place. \n[4]Pleased t'meetcha, Billy says yer workin' out. \n[5]Tert Card says he's keepin' an eye on ya. Since he's a self-servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous. And Nutbeem... \n[6]\n[7]Nutbeem's obsessed with actual news. Makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. Can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week. \n[8]Card's in charge. Ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out. \n[9]An' Billy. Well, Billy's a writer and a fisherman. Me, I'm just a fisherman. \n[10]Fishin' and the sea is all I am. My pap the same. My boy. \n[11]Naw, my boy's passed. Went to sea and there he rests. Bless his bones. \n[12]Want two things from ya, Quoyle. First. You cover every local car wreck, take pictures. Front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. When we don't, we dip into Card's file, he's got some beauties. \n[13]Knack to this. If there's a dark patch on the ground, it reads blood, whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke. Gloves, hat, lyin' in the road... \n[14]...somethin' that humanizes, makes ya feel. That's what a wreck is. It's always saying, 'There but for the grace of God...' \n[15]Plus. We're starting a feature on the shipping news. What ships come in, what goes out. Whatever's of interest. Throwin' it to you, son. Chance to shine. \n[16]Chance.    To shine. \n[17]One peculiarity. I'm no joke, son, and I don't tolerate jokes about Newfies. Or them that does. \n[18]  The word from Sinai on Quoyle's worth.       A pity.  \n[19]I'm goin' fishin'. \n[20]I saw it. And heard from some who'd done the same. Good. Neatness. \n[21]Reorganize. Start over.      Good thinking. \n[22]Got six phone calls 'bout that piece. Six. That'd be like half a million calls in Toronto. \n[23]People liked it, old son. Crowd went down to the dock t'see the thing, but it'd already pulled out. \n[24]Course you don't know anything about boats, but that's entertaining, too. So go ahead with it. That's the kinda stuff I want, see? \n[25]From now on, you write a column every week. The Shipping News. Gonna order you a computer and everything. And y'know the beauty part...? \n[26]I don't have to tell Card all over again, cause he's already eavesdroppin'. So I'm free to take m'leave. \n[27]Ah. You've an instinct for character and idiosyncrasy, old son. \n[28]Zip yer fly, Card. \n[29] HOLD on Card.   DISSOLVE TO...  \n[30]Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed somebody was out here. \n[31]Thank god fer yer figure, me old son. A thin man woulda froze. \n[32]Good.   Yer lost th'boat. \n[33]\n[34]\n[35] Quoyle alone with Jack in open water. Pulling on a slicker, gloves, picking up a knife. Jack is pronging cod onto the deck.  \n[36]Hands might as well be movin' while we chat. Always hated th' sight a grown men around a table workin' nuthin' but their jaws. \n[37]Well, Tert Card's gone, fer one thing. \n[38]Yar, I know, he never said g'bye. Well, don't get all weepy-eyed about it, old son. Try t'be a man. \n[39]They called him from St. John's, he tells me. Wants him to help put out th' newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers. \n[40]He was sassy an' he was smug. Oh, there's a waitin' list, he assures me. They only skims th' cream. \n[41]Truth t'tell. I was a wee help. B'hind the scenes, doncha know. \n[42]Sometimes.     Enough is enough. \n[43]...right where he is. Too old a fish t'swim faster'n be wants. Gotta find someone a little dumber t'take on a shit job like this! \n[44]Spot I'm in, Christmas and all. Might have to offer th'mess. To you. \n[45]Y'know. Yer do have the sense God gave a doughnut. \n[46]Any other outrageous demands? Seein' as yer got me over a barrel. Here's your one chance. \n[47]You were sayin'...? \n[48]Well, there's only one a those issued per family. So how exactly would he do that? \n[49]Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can push their luck. \n[50] Steel gray morning. The sea is more than a little rough, as Jack lays out his lobster traps. Two other boats, not too close by, appear and disappear in mist. He is checking the lines, knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down.  \n[51]Oh, th' Gandy Goose she ain't no uuuuse \n[52]Sweet Jesus. I'm turnin' inta Alvin Cockadoodle Yark! \n[53]What is this? Suicide attempt? \n[54] The road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'body knows ever'body.  \n[55] Every room is filled with folks who wear their best. There is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well- meaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Struggling to cope.  Quoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As they cross the room...  ...two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands, their bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open for all to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs.  "}}
