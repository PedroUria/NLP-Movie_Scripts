Marco's eyebrows go up.  \n[48]  \n[49]  \n[50]  \n[51]             \n[52]  \n[53]  \n[54]  \n[55]  \n[56]             \n[57]  \n[58]  \n[59]  \n[60]  \n[61]  \n[62] punches the line, lifts the receiver --  \n[63]  \n[64] CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EAR --  \n[65] CLOSE on RAYMOND'S EYE --  \n[66] -- everything is brighter, sharper, more luminous -- more etched than it was just moments ago --  \n[67]  \n[68]  \n[69]  \n[70]  \n[71]  \n[72]  \n[73]  \n[74]  \n[75]  \n[76]  \n[77]             \n[78]  \n[79]  \n[80]  \n[81]  \n[82]             \n[83]  \n[84]  \n[85]  \n[86]  \n[87]             \n[88]  \n[89] Marco stops, turns.  \n[90]             \n[91]  \n[92]  \n[93]  \n[94]  \n[95]  \n[96]  \n[97]               \n[98] Raymond looks steadily at Marco ... who nods, interested:  \n[99]  \n[100] Seeming startled, Raymond's reverie is broken.     His eyes harden as he refocuses on Marco.  \n[101]  \n[102]             \n[103] I don't have the dreams, Ben.  \n[104] I do.   I said I did.  \n[105] Ha ha, don't mix me up, I'm tired, and -- Fine. It's like this. It's as if I know what will happen, Ben, but I never get to the part where I feel that it actually did happen. But I think that's probably perfectly normal.  \n[106] What? No. Who would I ask? My old Army \"buddies,\" who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant -- present company excluded -- asses?  \n[107] I'm sure the press would have a field day with that.  \n[108] Nobody's put anything in me.             \n[109]  \n[110]  \n[111]  \n[112] Marco LUNGES at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering.  \n[113]  \n[114]  \n[115]  \n[116]  \n[117]  \n[118]  \n[119]  \n[120]  \n[121]               \n[122]  \n[123]  \n[124]  \n[125]  \n[126]  \n[127]             \n[128]             \n[129]  \n[130]  \n[131]             \n[132]  \n[133]  \n[134]  \n[135]  \n[136] Silence.   The question hangs there.  \n[137]  \n[138]  \n[139] There are actual tears in Ellie's eyes.

Anderson and Mirella -- the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin.  \n[190] ... which is exactly what Melvin said to him.  \n[191] Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture.  \n[192] He jams the notebook back into his folder, starts to walk away.  \n[193]  \n[194]  \n[195]  \n[196]  \n[197]  \n[198]  \n[199] Who said I was jealous?  \n[200] How can you not remember saving the unit?  \n[201] You said you don't remember doing it.  \n[202] Did you ever talk to anybody about this little discrepancy?  \n[203] No.  You ask Army Intelligence. Look, we can go together, tomorrow. You tell them what you just told me, everything you do remember, what you don't \"exactly\" remember, about Kuwait, let 'em run some tests on you --  \n[204] Raymond. They put an implant in me. I found it yesterday. Maybe they put one in you.  \n[205] Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away --  \n[206]  \n[207]  \n[208]  \n[209] KNOCKING at the door:  \n[210] -- where Marco  wraps Raymond in a headlock, RIPS Raymond's shirt from the shoulder --             \n[211]  \n[212]  \n[213]             \n[214]  \n[215]  \n[216]    \n[217]  \n[218]  \n[219] Implant.

There are SOLDIERS here, with weapons -- could be here to guard Marco. Could be here to protect him.  \n[316] His arm is in a simple sling. He moves like a man who's been shot, and not quite recovered -- moves past Rosie, out of the broken-down ruins ...  \n[317] ... Rosie motions the soldiers to stay back, follows him by herself ...  \n[318] PULL BACK as they walk down the beach to the sea. A few tumble-down buildings are all that remains of an ancient seaside town.  \n[319] Marco approaches the water's edge, staring out at the uncertain horizon.
