Twenty ton bodies with little tiny brains. \n[17]They work day and night, no drivers, shucking their cloned up super-corn. Bears fruit in half the time. Taste like shit, though. \n[18]They don't. They drink it. Corn syrup. Its in all those drugged up drinks everyone's having nowadays-- to stay awake, feel strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day, you know? \n[19]Looks like we'll be here a while. \n[20]How long's your girl been that way? Mute. \n[21]Some ways I envy you.

I thought that tank was supposed to provide some sort of barrier. It's got all these cracks in it. What good is that? \n[6]He's been asking questions again. He's trying to read my mind. \n[7]I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things. \n[8]Well. Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low. To suppress the seizures. \n[9]I almost died this morning. That seizure was a-- \n[10]It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look.

You don't want to talk about that. Or the booze you're drinking or the pus you keep wiping from your knuckles or the blood I wash from your clothes or those brand new holes in your chest, that haven't healed. And I very much doubt you want to talk about the fact that you can't read the label on the side of that bottle. It's Ibuprofen. \n[16]That was my favorite mug. \n[17]Something's happening to you, Logan. On the inside. I can smell it. You're sick. \n[18]You're supposed to be leading us somewhere. \n[19]Tell me you didn't rob a bank. \n[20]So you did rob a bank. \n[21]Hello!

They were born here and they have never left. Never seen the sun or ocean, the rain or snow or any of God's creatures. \n[23]They have no birth certificates, no names beside the ones we have given them. They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls. \n[24]--girls no one can find anymore. \n[25]Their fathers were semillas gen\u00e9tica, special seeds in bottles. \n[26]They told us they were part of a pharmaceutical study. \n[27]But of course, that was a lie. \n[28]They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand. We are poor, but we are not stupid. I knew what they were doing. \n[29]When I was a child, I learned English from these. \n[30]This is business. They are making soldiers. Weapons X. These are babies of mutantes muerta. \n[31] \n[32]As the children became older, they became difficult to control. \n[33]They taught them to kill-- but they did not remove their hearts. \n[34]They could not be controlled. \n[35]A soldier who cannot be controlled is not a good soldier. \n[36] \n[37]I got inside yesterday. \n[38]They told us to destroy files.

Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic.

Your peaks and your valleys. Mostly valleys-- it's all so Goddamn boring. \n[75]You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing? \n[76]There is a young mutant.

And you're screaming at a machine. \n[87]She can learn to be better. \n[88]Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender. In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival. \n[89]We have to help them.  \n[90]Someone has come along.  \n[91]   \n[92]  \n[93] \n[94]Slow down, child. \n[95]South Dakota. \n[96]Oregon, then South Dakota. \n[97]Yes.

She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety. \n[104]I'm not a box of avocados. \n[105]We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker. \n[106]My son can go with you. \n[107] \n[108]You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it. You still have time. \n[109]It is for Laura. \n[110]...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour. \n[111]...This was, without a doubt, the most splendid night I've had in a long time. ...but then... \n[112]...I don't deserve it, do I? ...I did something... unspeakable. \n[113]I remembered what happened in Westchester. This was not the first time I've hurt people. Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. We just kept running from it. I'm done running. \n[114]  \n[115]Logan... \n[116]   \n[117]...our boat... ...our Eden... ", "Laura": "\n[1] \n[2] \n[3]\n[4]   \n[5]A reincarnation of Weapon X. From the floor, Will's eyes fix on Logan, life draining from him. Logan meets Bad Logan's yellow eyes. Logan glances to-- The blood drenched stairs-- where he last saw Charles. Laura watches, trapped in the restraints as-- Bad Logan suddenly moves away, with Laura toward the front \n[6]   \n[7] \n[8]De nada. \n[9] \n[10] \n[11]Tu espera que hable con tu cuando no mirarme?

Charles told me. \n[24]To not let you. \n[25]Rest. \n[26] \n[27]Pesadillas. ...you had night-mare. \n[28]...People hurt me. \n[29]Por que? \n[30] \n[31]I've hurt people too. \n[32]They were bad people. \n[33]  \n[34]And where will you go? \n[35]Such a nice man. \n[36]Then I will be fine. \n[37] \n[38]Ella! \n[39]     \n[40]You took all the medicine. \n[41]...It's wearing off. \n[42]Laura.

You can't break the mould.  \n[48]There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks.

You don't wanna do this. \n[7]\n[8]Back to work, old man. \n[9]They're locked, ma'am. \n[10]Don't we all. \n[11]   \n[12]Who the fuck are you? \n[13]Get out. Now. \n[14]I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out. \n[15]What do you want? \n[16]Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? \n[17]Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but I am telling you I have 45 cash now. Just bring it to port in Baja. \n[18]They're all bad days. \n[19]I'm working on it. \n[20]He's not talking with anybody. \n[21]Please stop. \n[22] \n[23]No. \n[24]You know who I am. \n[25]We could both use some sleep. \n[26]Charles, you're making this-- \n[27]You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures, the pills keep them from happening. \n[28]How `bout you blow on them to make them safe. \n[29]So you know who I am now. \n[30]Take the pills. \n[31]A what? \n[32]Too bad you're not in that business anymore. \n[33]The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time. \n[34]There are no new mutants. Hasn't been a new one born in twenty-five years. Not anywhere. \n[35]You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake. \n[36]I'm not in the mood for bedtime-- \n[37] \n[38]It's for your own good. \n[39]    \n[40]  \n[41]What things. \n[42]It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands. \n[43]It wasn't even a minute. \n[44]That money's to get us out of here. \n[45]I don't need this right now. \n[46]Oh, Jesus. \n[47] \n[48]I don't want to know your name! \n[49]Anyone can do that job. \n[50] \n[51]Sightings. \n[52]And by people, you mean fat fucktards living in their parents' basements playing with dolls? \n[53]Get your fat ass back in your office. You'll get your money. \n[54]When did that happen? \n[55]Where did you get this? \n[56]Does to me. \n[57]That's your daughter? \n[58]I can't leave right now. \n[59]Or what? \n[60]I can get you there Friday. But I need to go home first, take care of some things. \n[61]I'll be back in a few hours. Keep this locked. And tell your mommy I know she's lying. \n[62]I got a job that's gonna pay enough to change things. But I have to go away. For a week. \n[63]Charles. Listen. I gotta go for a few days. I got a long ride for some good money. When I get back, we're getting out of here, okay. Gonna drive down to Yelapa and get ourselves a boat. Live on the ocean. \n[64]Yeah. I'll be safe. \n[65]Ready to go? \n[66]...Fuck. \n[67] \n[68]Aren't you supposed to see shit coming? \n[69]Go inside. Keep Charles quiet. Go. Inside. \n[70]You need to turn around, asshole. This is private property. \n[71]He's been dead for a year. \n[72]What girl. \n[73]There's no girl here. \n[74]I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman. \n[75]No. Did you? \n[76]I don't like guns. \n[77]Hey! \n[78]Worse. \n[79]Not for long. Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures. \n[80]Text me where you are and we'll pick you up. \n[81]You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into. \n[82]What. \n[83]So she talks. \n[84]  \n[85]She's not a mutant. \n[86] \n[87] \n[88] \n[89]Don't move! \n[90]She's not our problem. \n[91]     \n[92]I'm thinking. \n[93] \n[94]Where's Caliban? \n[95]I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?! \n[96] \n[97]BOOTS AND BEAT HIM TO THE GROUND. There are too many. Pummeled, overwhelmed, his limbs all pinned, Logan turns over to find PIERCE'S FOOT TO HIS THROAT. Pierce leans down. \n[98]As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. \n[99]OTHERS as Laura pulls the harpoon from her side and runs. Laura is grabbed by THREE MORE REAVERS, WHO RESTRAIN HER AND \n[100]Hold on! \n[101]WIPES OUT THE REAVER BIKES. One of the riders tumbles and grabs onto the chain link tail, the limo dragging him. The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield. Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE. Pierce angrily peels his truck in another direction. Logan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock. TWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as-- Logan steers the limo through a series of concrete structures \n[102]   \n[103]\n[104]Who the fuck are you? \n[105]No. I don't. \n[106]Battery's dead. We need a plug. \n[107]Charles. \n[108]What is she? \n[109]Not just mine. \n[110]I don't wanna hear it. I don't want to talk about it anymore. \n[111]Stop. \n[112]Last ride. Then we're leaving. \n[113]You're welcome. \n[114]Well, you're not doing it! \n[115]Not okay. \n[116]Sorry. \n[117]Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   49. \n[118]      \n[119]We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple hours sleep, clean up, get new clothes, ditch the limo, get a new ride and get the fuck out. \n[120]Keep it out front. \n[121]Please wait till we're in the room. \n[122]Sorry. Going up. \n[123]...For fuck's sake. \n[124]You read this in your spare time? \n[125]You do know this is bullshit, right? A quarter of it happened. And none like this. In the real world, people die and no self promoting asshole in a leotard can stop it. This is just ice cream for \n[126]Right. Fine. \n[127]Take two more in an hour. \n[128]...Fuck. \n[129]Knock yourselves out. \n[130]...yeah. Here's the thing. I'll give you twelve as is-- if you can forget the paperwork. \n[131]How long is that gonna take? \n[132]Jesus Christ... \n[133]`you gotta be fuckin' kidding me. \n[134]I'll take the bottle. \n[135]I don't know. \n[136]Come on, come on! \n[137] \n[138]We have to go. \n[139]Hey! Now! \n[140]This way! \n[141]Knock it off. \n[142]I said knock it off. \n[143]How long has it been since you took your meds? Charles. How long? \n[144]You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino-- \n[145]You didn't do anything. You freaked out and had a fucking seizure. \n[146]Easier? There's nothing easy about you. \n[147]Yeah, I know, Pop, I'm such a giant \n[148]What are we doing?! \n[149]Yes. It means nothing to me. Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all this Eden shit up from fucking comic books. \n[150]Give those to him. Take out two and give them to him. \n[151]Now. For fuck's sake. Take the pills. Now. \n[152]Take them. Give him the pills. \n[153] \n[154]\n[155] \n[156]She. I might have been speeding. \n[157]If it wasn't, there'd be a lot more than her behind us. I need you to please try and not kill this lady. Okay? \n[158]Was I going a mite fast, officer? \n[159]I just bought it, but I-- here-- \n[160]Seventy? Ish? \n[161]Shit. I didn't think this thing could make that. \n[162]Yes, ma'am. \n[163]She doesn't speak. \n[164]Laura. \n[165]\n[166]\n[167]What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words? \n[168]You mean, better than me. \n[169]Shit. Oh well.   \n[170]We have to keep moving. Someone will come along.  \n[171]Can I give you a hand?  \n[172]James. Howlett.    \n[173]Yeah. That's Laura. And that's my... dad. Chuck. \n[174]North. \n[175]No, thank you, we really can't-- Laura, get back here. \n[176]Oregon. \n[177]Oh. I uh, I-- \n[178] \n[179]We'll find a motel. \n[180]Kathryn. That's very nice of you, but we really should hit the-- \n[181]Let's go wash up, Pop. \n[182]That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving. \n[183]And then what. We stay the night and then what? \n[184]What is it? \n[185]Who's \"they?\" \n[186]I'll go. \n[187]Just let me get my dad... settled. \n[188]There's a TV in here. \n[189]Okay... Get some rest. \n[190]Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book. \n[191]You just need to understand-- it's not real. \n[192]So today, out on the highway-- \n[193]So why do people eat it? \n[194]Mine still are. \n[195]Since... well.. the beginning. \n[196]You're a lucky man. \n[197]That should hold it. \n[198] \n[199]I hear that a lot. \n[200]More than I'd like. \n[201]Three. \n[202]You all know the drill. Go. \n[203]Some. \n[204]No, but I'll take a drink if you got one. \n[205] \n[206]   \n[207]      \n[208]  \n[209]Only on days that end in \"Y.\" \n[210] \n[211]  \n[212]  \n[213]You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need-- \n[214]--What? \n[215]  \n[216] \n[217]SETS OF CLAWS when-- LOGAN RAISES HIS CLAWS AND, with all his strength, struggles to hold back X-24 PRESSING DOWN, THEIR BLADES INTERLOCKED. X-24 is too much for him. Logan knows he cannot beat this thing, and he rolls from beneath him, X-24's claws spearing into the dirt. Logan stumbles to his feet, X-24 doing the same and as he lunges again, Logan retreats, starting a crooked, delirious line toward -- Laura. \n[218] \n[219]\n[220]  \n[221]Hold still! Stop it! Stop! \n[222]Well. It's got water and... it's... \n[223]--its got water and it's -- \n[224]...Fuck this... \n[225]...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my-- \n[226]--I'm alright. I'm fine. \n[227]...I know what it is. \n[228]--Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way. \n[229]Let's go. \n[230]You can't just take shit, you know. \n[231]Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you. \n[232]...You can talk? \n[233]You can talk. \n[234]What the fuck?! Why haven't you-- What's all this bullshit been for the last two thousand miles of-- \n[235]\n[236]Who is that? \n[237]Okay. Look. This place. Your mom... she read too many... stories. \n[238]Yeah, I know... I saw it... \n[239]Right. This place does not exist. No exist-o. It's fictional. Eden does not exist. \n[240] \n[241]Yes, I know. It's a long way. \n[242]Okay. First-- ow. Second, Look at me. I'm fucked up. That's two days driving from here. \n[243]Stop saying those names-- \n[244]Do. Not. Hit. Me. \n[245]--And stop saying those-- \n[246]Okay-- ENOUGH. Enough. \n[247]No. Absolutely not. \n[248]Quit looking at me. \n[249]No comprende. \n[250] \n[251]Hey. \n[252]  \n[253]Where am I? \n[254]Where did you get this?! \n[255]It makes you crazy is what it does. It'll kill you. \n[256] \n[257]...No. \n[258]Do you have nightmares? \n[259]Mine are different. \n[260]I hurt people. \n[261]You know what it is. \n[262]It's made of Adamantium. Same thing they put inside us. That's why it can kill us. Probably killing me now. Anyway, I got that a long time ago. Kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to-- Actually, I was thinking about shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. \n[263]You're gonna have to learn how to live with that. \n[264]All the same. \n[265]What. \n[266]Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth was real. He was in a program with me. Like what they did to you. \n[267]Yes. \n[268]Kid, I don't know what I'm doing. \n[269]Not funny. Not funny at all. \n[270]Hey, pal, how long have I been out? \n[271]Hey. \n[272]How long have I been in that bed? \n[273]You've been sitting here two days? You can't do that. You can't just stay here forever. \n[274]Well, if you keep waiting those assholes will find you. And kill you all. You need to get out. \n[275]To Canada? \n[276]Okay. Good. \n[277]Keep it. For your supplies or whatever. \n[278]Yeah. Well. Look. I don't need this. You do. For supplies. Buy her some cereal. \n[279]They seem nice. Your friends. Kinda remind me-- \n[280]What's going on with you? \n[281]Hey. I asked you a question. What are you pissed about? You're with your friends. You made it. \n[282]Nearest bar, for starters. \n[283]What-- you thought I was coming along? \n[284]That was never the deal. I got you this far, that's all I signed up for. I gave back the money -- \n[285]Hey, I never asked for this. \n[286]Look, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I'm not... whatever it is you think I am. \n[287]You don't need me. You've got Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby, blah blah whoever. Hey. It's better this way. I suck at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. \n[288]    \n[289]\n[290]Laura! Now! \n[291]Go to your friends, Laura. \n[292]...You'll know when. \n[293]He's the asshole who put this poison in me. \n[294]I think I might have killed him. \n[295]Growing mutants of your own. \n[296]Yeah. Dangerous. \n[297]        \n[298]Laura... \n[299] \n[300]   \n[301]...Take your friends and run. Go. Listen to me, Laura. Run.
