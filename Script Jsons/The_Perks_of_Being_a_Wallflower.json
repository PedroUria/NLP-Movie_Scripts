No shit! Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she? \n[18]I try, Sam. I try. \n[19]So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house? \n[20] \n[21]That works on so many levels. \n[22]Not a band, Charlie. \n[23]I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So, watch out, Charlie. She'll ruin your life forever. \n[24]Let it go!     Jesus!   It's an old joke! It's over! \n[25]Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make us solve crimes. \n[26]But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake. \n[27]She just really believes in bulimia. \n[28]Thanks for paying, Charlie. \n[29]Bye, Charlie. \n[30]Holy shit. They are!   They're playing good music! \n[31]Living room routine! Hey! \n[32]But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be original. \n[33]\"He's sensitive.\" \n[34]You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say \"no\" on that one, but nice try. Charlie? \n[35]Charlie... this is a party. \n[36]This is what fun looks like. \n[37]You ready to meet some desperate women? \n[38]Here, have a seat. Hey, ladies, meet Charlie. Charlie, meet ladies. \n[39]This is Charlie's first party ever. So, I expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you. \n[40]Where the hell did you go? \n[41]You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone. \n[42]How is it that you got meaner since \n[43]I think you're doing something wrong. \n[44]Charlie? \n[45]Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here. \n[46]I know you saw something, but it's okay. \n[47]Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to know... wait, are you baked? \n[48]Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret. \n[49]Thank you.     We'll talk later. \n[50]Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie. \n[51]You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower. \n[52]What is it? What's wrong? \n[53]Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone... To Charlie. \n[54]Right?    I have no idea. \n[55]Sam, it's freezing. \n[56]No.     Mama Patrick says no. \n[57] \n[58]Don't worry. She does it all the time. \n[59]You got it, your highness. \n[60]What? \n[61]Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same. \n[62]Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh! \n[63]I don't know. \n[64]I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her... don't make yourself small. You can't save anybody. \n[65]If you fail me, you get me next semester. \n[66]Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average! \n[67]  \n[68]Impossible! \n[69]I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song \"Asleep\" on it... twice. \n[70]I mean, I have no idea. This collection of presents is so gay that I think I must have given them to myself. But despite that distinct possibility, I'm going to have to go with... drum roll... Charlie. \n[71]Huh.   Now, why do you say that? \n[72]Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me. \n[73]Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star. \n[74]Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam. \n[75]Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever seen! \n[76]  \n[77]Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart. \n[78]I love you guys! \n[79]10-9-8... \n[80]7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year! \n[81]Who are you talking to? \n[82] \n[83]Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot \"fag on goth\" action. \n[84]Okay. My turn. Um... let's think... Charlie... truth or dare? \n[85]How is your first relationship going? \n[86]Charlie?   Truth or dare? \n[87]I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches. \n[88]Now that's fucked up. \n[89]Trust me.    You don't want to go back there. \n[90]I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile. \n[91]Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry. \n[92]You going to do something? \n[93]Your pet ape just tripped me.    Are you going to say something? \n[94]You know why. \n[95]Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really? \n[96]Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know about Schenley Park? Do you guys know about Schenley Park? \n[97]Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me. \n[98]What did you call me? \n[99]Say that shit again!    Say that shit again! \n[100]  \n[101]Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon. \n[102]Hey... you wanna get out of here? \n[103]I'll tell you something, Charlie. I feel good. You know what I mean? Maybe tomorrow I'll take you to this karaoke place downtown. And this club off the strip. They don't card. And the Schenley Park scene. You gotta see the \"fruit loop\" at least one time. \n[104]Oh, my God. My life is officially an after school special. Son of a bitch! \n[105]So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller? \n[106]Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic. \n[107]So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened? \n[108]They did it with one of the sandwich bags. \n[109]Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie! \n[110]Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go. \n[111]That's your suburban legend?     Did you at least cop a feel? \n[112]Of course not. You went home, listened to \"Asleep,\" wrote a poem about her self- esteem-- \n[113]Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill. Guy's father didn't know about his son. So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. Catches his son with another boy. So, he starts beating him. But not like the slap kind. Like the real kind. And the boyfriend says, \"Stop. You're killing him.\" And the son just yells \"Get out.\" And eventually the boyfriend just did. \n[114]Why can't you save anybody? \n[115]Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could meet the love of my life any second now. Things will be different now, and that's good. I just need to meet a good guy. \n[116]I'm sorry. \n[117]  \n[118]  \n[119]  \n[120]Oh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo! We should all take a group photo. Get against the railing and try to look suave! \n[121]Yeah, this is the one. That's going to be a great angle. \n[122]  \n[123]  \n[124]  \n[125]   \n[126]  \n[127]  \n[128]Can Charlie come out and play? \n[129]Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October. ", "Charlie": "\n[1]  \n[2]Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous. \n[3]   \n[4]I hope it's okay for me to think that. You see, I haven't really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer. \n[5]  \n[6]But tomorrow is my first day of high school ever, and I really need to turn things around this year. So, I have a plan. \n[7]As I enter the school for the first time, I will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year. \n[8]Unfortunately, I counted, and that's... \n[9]... 1,385 days from now. \n[10] \n[11]In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister Candace and her boyfriend Derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club. \n[12]When my sister said no, I thought maybe my old friend Susan would want to have lunch with me. \n[13]In middle school, Susan was very fun to be around, but now she doesn't like to say hi to me anymore. \n[14]And then there's Brad Hays, who's the quarterback of our team. Before my brother went to play football for Penn State, he and Brad played together. So, I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am I kidding? \n[15]On the bright side, one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's legendary goatee with a grease pencil. \n[16]I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything. He was just trying to make us freshmen feel better. \n[17]My last class of the day is advanced English, and I'm excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school... \n[18]Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing. \n[19]Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay. \n[20]Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just so I say it to someone, high school is even worse than middle school. \n[21]  \n[22]If my parents ask me about it, I probably won't tell them the truth because I don't want them to worry that I might get bad again. \n[23]  \n[24]If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could talk to her. And I know she would understand how I am both happy and sad, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be. I just hope I make a friend soon. Love always, Charlie. \n[25]   \n[26]Yes, sir.    I sure do. \n[27]Are you sure? \n[28]  \n[29]  \n[30]  \n[31]  \n[32]Hey... Patrick. \n[33]My dad's building it. \n[34]No.   I'll sit if that's okay. \n[35]So, uh... you like football? \n[36]Then, maybe you know my broth-- \n[37]Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis. \n[38]Is that what they call him? \n[39]I think The Smiths are my favorite. \n[40]Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape. \n[41]I could make a copy for you. \n[42] \n[43]That's okay. Hey, Nothing. Hey, Nothing. \n[44]My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about. \n[45]You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? What? \n[46]I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means. \n[47]  \n[48] \n[49]Okay.   Bye. \n[50]  \n[51]  \n[52]   \n[53]What are you doing? \n[54]Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends? \n[55]Are you sure it's okay that I come? \n[56]Is that Brad Hays? \n[57]But he's a popular kid. \n[58]Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks. \n[59]Have you guys felt this carpet?     This carpet feels so darn good. \n[60]High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it. \n[61]And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs. I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head. \n[62]I just really want a milkshake. \n[63]Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I mean? \n[64]What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy. \n[65]Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too. \n[66]Oh, he shot himself last May. \n[67]I kind of wish he'd left a note.    You know what I mean? Where's the bathroom? \n[68]25. \n[69]Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird. \n[70]Woah. \n[71]I didn't see anything. \n[72]\"Like a cake.\" That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny. \n[73]Our little secret.     Agreed. \n[74]I look forward to that big talk. \n[75]Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one. \n[76]What did I do? \n[77]27. \n[78]Never. \n[79]What is she doing? \n[80]I feel infinite. \n[81]   \n[82]Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser. \n[83]For example, I am trying to participate by listening to Sam's collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love. Sam says they are kitschy and brilliant. I completely agree. \n[84]I am also studying extra books outside of class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer. He even had a play put up in New York once, which I think is very impressive. He and his wife might go back there after this year. I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't. \n[85]My favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky. Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a \"long day.\" \n[86]Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened. \n[87]When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around. \n[88]Then, Monday in school, Brad would say, \"Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember a thing.\" This went on for 7 months. \n[89]When they finally did it, Brad said he loved Patrick. Then, he started to cry. \n[90]saying his dad would kill him. And saying he was going to hell. \n[91]Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him. \n[92]I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like. \n[93]  \n[94]So, I've been making her a mix tape so she will know how I feel. \n[95]Ah, shit! \n[96]Hey.    Are you okay? \n[97]You can take them again. \n[98]I'll help you study for the next one. \n[99]Yeah, of course. \n[100]Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so-- \n[101]Really? \n[102]No. \n[103] \n[104]Yeah. \n[105]Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something? \n[106]Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date? \n[107]Can we make them know they deserve more? \n[108]Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You want to work on probabilities and statistics? \n[109]   \n[110]Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars? \n[111]Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please. \n[112]Thanks. \n[113]Thanks. \n[114]You too, Mr. Anderson. \n[115]Where's Craig? \n[116]I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight. \n[117]Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth. \n[118]I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes. \n[119]Sorry. \n[120]You got me clothes?     Why? \n[121]Can you hand these out while I'm gone? \n[122]Where are we going? \n[123]Is this your room?    It's so cool. \n[124]You got me a present? \n[125]I don't know what to say. \n[126]That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad. \n[127]You are. \n[128] \n[129]Well, it hasn't worked so far. \n[130]No.   What about you? \n[131] \n[132]Was he your first boyfriend? \n[133]It's true.     You can do it. \n[134]My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around. \n[135]She was my favorite person in the world... until now. \n[136]I love you, too. \n[137]Have a good time at your mom's. \n[138]Thank you, Patrick. \n[139]  \n[140]46. \n[141]   \n[142]  \n[143]   \n[144]  \n[145]Hey. \n[146]How are you liking school? \n[147]Okay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game. \n[148]Good. \n[149]No. \n[150]I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off. \n[151]Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now. \n[152]How long does this take to work? \n[153]I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it. \n[154]Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then \n[155]Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you? \n[156]  \n[157]  \n[158]  \n[159]  \n[160]  \n[161]  \n[162]No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never. \n[163]Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out. \n[164] \n[165]It was a Christmas present. \n[166]Did you have fun on your break? \n[167]But they said in health class-- \n[168]Are you sure? \n[169]Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something? \n[170]That'd be great. Thanks. \n[171]The one where the girl asks the guy. \n[172]You want to go with me? \n[173]  \n[174]  \n[175]Are you having a good time? \n[176]I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to. \n[177]I'm sorry Craig didn't come. \n[178]I don't know. If you like it, he should come. \n[179]I'll try not to make you too jealous. \n[180]This is sure a nice house. \n[181]This merlot is really fancy. \n[182]I guess.    Where are your parents? \n[183]That's sure a nice fire. \n[184]Yeah. \n[185]Is it? \n[186]Uh-huh? \n[187]Uh-huh. \n[188]I think so. \n[189]Yeah. \n[190]  \n[191]Dear Friend... I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but things are a total disaster. \n[192]I probably should have been honest about how I didn't want to go out with Mary Elizabeth after Sadie's, but I really didn't want to hurt her feelings. \n[193]You see, Mary Elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone. And since I heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy, I tried hard to love her like I love Sam. \n[194]I know. \n[195]So, I took her on double dates. \n[196]60. \n[197]And I tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty. \n[198]And I had to admit something really upsetting. But I am tired of touching her boobs. I thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make-out music once in awhile, we might have a chance. \n[199]And maybe if she didn't put down the books that Mr. Anderson gives me. \n[200]  \n[201]Or if she would stop calling me the minute I get home from school when I have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home... \n[202]  \n[203]I can do that? \n[204]  \n[205]I know I should have been honest, but I was getting so mad, it was starting to scare me. \n[206]Um... Mary Elizabeth. Can I talk to you-- \n[207]I just wish I could have found another way to break up. In hindsight, I probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with Mary Elizabeth. \n[208]Truth. \n[209]It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her. \n[210]Dare. \n[211]Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm-- \n[212]Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. \n[213]64. \n[214]But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything. \n[215] \n[216]    \n[217]  \n[218]  \n[219]I'll... I'll be there in a minute. \n[220]  \n[221]  \n[222]  \n[223]Mary Elizabeth... I... uh... I've been listening to the Billie Holiday CD every night and-- \n[224]I know. I just feel really bad about what I did. I just get so messed up inside like I'm - not there or something. \n[225]I know. I'm sorry. I just.     We've all become such good friends-- \n[226]Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do anything to ruin our-- \n[227]Okay.   I will. Goodbye, Mar-- \n[228]Something's wrong with me-- \n[229]No.   He told me to stay away. \n[230] \n[231]Are you okay? \n[232] \n[233]Yeah? \n[234]Sure, Brad. \n[235]I don't know. I keep trying, but... I can't really remember what I did. \n[236] \n[237]So, you're not scared of me? \n[238]And can we be friends again? \n[239]I'm just glad you're happy. \n[240]Sure, Patrick. \n[241] \n[242]I don't know. \n[243]Maybe. \n[244]I don't know. \n[245]Ew!   That's disgusting! \n[246]Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade-- \n[247]And she let some of the boys feel them. \n[248]No. \n[249]Fine!    Okay. Your turn. \n[250]I don't know. \n[251]Yeah. \n[252]It's alright. \n[253]I've been spending a lot of time with Patrick. He begins every night really excited. \n[254]He always says he feels free, and tonight is his destiny. But after awhile, he runs out of things to keep himself numb. \n[255]Then, Sam got her letter from Penn State. \n[256]After that all Patrick could talk about \n[257]did get into NYU Film School. Patrick is going to the University of Washington because he wants to be near the music in Seattle. \n[258]But he wasn't going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever. \n[259]Sam is going to leave right after graduation. It all feels very exciting; I just wish it were happening to me. \n[260]  \n[261]Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time. \n[262]Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York? \n[263]Yeah.   Yeah. \n[264] \n[265]You're the best teacher I ever had. \n[266]Dear Friend... I wanted to tell you about us running. There was this beautiful sunset. And just a few hours before, everyone I love had their last day of high school ever. And I was happy because they were happy, even though I counted, and I have 1,095 days to go. \n[267]  \n[268]I kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they \n[269]My sister finally decided to break up with Derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead. \n[270]And then there was Sam... \n[271]I've looked at her pictures since that night. I like to see how happy she was before she knew. \n[272]They were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out... \n[273]Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam the whole time. When I heard that, I kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures. Because she doesn't have 1,095 days to go. \n[274]She made it. This is her time. And no one should be able to take that away. \n[275]Congratulations. \n[276]At her going away party, I wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel. And how for the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere. \n[277]And tomorrow, she's leaving. So, I wanted to give her a part of me. \n[278]Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition. \n[279]Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore. \n[280]Yeah? \n[281]We accept the love we think we deserve. \n[282]I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that. \n[283]I just want you to be happy. \n[284]I know who you are, Sam. \n[285]I know I'm quiet, and I know I should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. How much we are alike. And how we've been through the same things. And you're not small. You're beautiful. \n[286]Oh, ah... nothing. \n[287]  \n[288]  \n[289]  \n[290]  \n[291]   \n[292]  \n[293]Stop crying. \n[294]  \n[295]Stop crying. \n[296]  \n[297]It'll be our little secret. \n[298]Hey, Candace. \n[299]Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something. \n[300]Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over. \n[301]And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again. \n[302]I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace? \n[303]   \n[304]       \n[305]Where am I? \n[306]You have to let me go.    My dad can't afford it. \n[307]No. I saw them when I was little. And I don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just tell me how to stop it. \n[308]Seeing it. All their lives. All the time. Just... how do you stop seeing it? \n[309]There is so much pain.    And I don't know how to not notice it. \n[310]No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand? \n[311]What about her? \n[312]Yes, she had a terrible life.   But... I mean, what am I... \n[313]I don't care. \n[314]She was... insane. \n[315]Okay. \n[316]I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home... \n[317]I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days. \n[318]The worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what Aunt Helen did to me. \n[319]The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job. \n[320]My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together. \n[321]   \n[322]How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad? \n[323]What do the players call a puck again? \n[324]  \n[325]Definitely. \n[326]I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me. \n[327]Even if you didn't know what I was talking about. Or know someone who's gone through it. It made me not feel alone. \n[328]Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17. \n[329]I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories. \n[330]This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. \n[331]I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world. \n[332]And in this moment, I swear... \n[333]... we are infinite.
