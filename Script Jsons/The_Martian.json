Thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis, astronauts Beck, Johanssen, Martinez, and Vogel were all able to reach the Mars Ascent Vehicle and perform an emergency launch at 7:28 central time. Unfortunately, during the evacuation, Astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed. Commander Lewis and the rest of her team were able to intercept safely with the Hermes and are now heading home...  But Mark Watney is dead. \n[3]Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program. His loss will be deeply felt, but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth, onward and upward, unbroken in the mission of their agency. In doing so, they honor the legacy Mark leaves behind, and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain. \n[4]  \n[5]   \n[6]It's not gonna happen. \n[7]No. \n[8]You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater. \n[9]It's not about the satellite time, Vince. \n[10]We're a public domain organization. We have to be transparent about this. \n[11]The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world. \n[12]Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post. \n[13]Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year. \n[14]Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time. \n[15]How sure? \n[16]Annie, one thing at a time. Prove it to me. \n[17]They could have been cleaned by wind. \n[18]She could have forgotten to log the move. \n[19]No. If Watney is really alive... we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know. \n[20]They have another ten months on their trip home. Space travel is dangerous. We need them alert and undistracted. \n[21]How do we handle the public? \n[22]We'll need to release a statement with them. We don't want people working it out on their own. \n[23] \n[24] \n[25]He's alive. But if my math is right, he's gonna starve to death long before we can help him. I'm not exactly looking forward to that conversation. \n[26]Don't say \"Bring him home alive,\" Vincent. \n[27]Annie... \n[28]Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right? \n[29]I am. \n[30]Quit being a dick, Mitch. Where's Mark going? Is this another test? \n[31]He didn't load up the Oxygenator or the Water Reclaimer? \n[32]You didn't see it? \n[33]I want that gap down to four minutes. I'm giving you total authority over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments. Make it happen. \n[34]Let's assume Ms. Park didn't miss something, so Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet. But he's smart enough to figure out that's his only chance. Bruce, what's the earliest we could get a presupply there? 35.  \n[35]Three months. You're gonna say that's impossible, then I'm gonna give a speech about the blinding capabilities of the JPL team. And then you'll do the math in your head and say something like \"The overtime alone will be a nightmare.\" \n[36]Get started. I'll find you the money. \n[37]Sorry, Mitch. I'm with Vincent. They need to concentrate on getting home. \n[38]Once we have a real rescue plan, we'll tell them. Otherwise it's moot. Bruce has three months to get the payload done. That's all that matters right now. \n[39]Mark dies if you don't. 36.  \n[40]  \n[41]Yes sir... he's under a tremendous amount of stress... I understand. We're working on it. Thank you, sir. \n[42]I just had to explain to the President of the United States what a \"bureaucratic felcher\" is. 45.  \n[43]You're bringing this up while Vincent's in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side. \n[44]Let's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation. I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window. \n[45]Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances. \n[46]Bruce, is your team still on schedule? 50.  \n[47]Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis? \n[48]Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong... \n[49]And rations get him to what? Sol 409? \n[50]We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time. \n[51]  \n[52]I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news. \n[53]Okay, let's ask the...  Two hundred million dollar... sorry, five hundred... That's a \"five?\"  Let's ask the very, very expensive question: is this probe gonna be ready on time? \n[54]Give me a number. \n[55]All right, let's create fifteen days. Thirteen days to mount the probe. Can we reduce? \n[56]How often do those inspections reveal a problem? \n[57]Right now I'm asking how often they reveal a problem. \n[58]Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time? \n[59]Tell Dr. Keller to stretch Watney's rations four more days. She won't like it, but that'll get us to fifteen. And we'll cancel the inspections. \n[60]It's on me, Vincent. You've got your two weeks. Get it done. \n[61]In order to make our launch window, we were forced to accelerate our schedule. \n[62]Yes. \n[63]   \n[64]Yes. \n[65] \n[66]How? \n[67]Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA. \n[68]Rich? \n[69]Get out. \n[70]Is he right? \n[71]And we need to use the Taiyeng Shen? \n[72]Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4, or send Hermes back to get him right now. \n[73]Can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission end? \n[74]We still have the chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound. I'm not risking their lives. \n[75]Mitch. We're going with option one. 72.  \n[76]  \n[77]Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars. \n[78]You may have killed the whole crew. \n[79]We're fighting the same war. Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly. I'm trying to keep us airborne. This is bigger than one person. \n[80]When this is over... I'll expect your resignation. 80.  \n[81] Bring our astronauts home. ", "Sanders": "\n[1]   ", "Mark": "\n[1]In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly \"coarse,\" but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis. \n[2]What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright? \n[3]Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth. \n[4]Doctor Beck. And yes. \n[5]Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a -- 3.  \n[6]What's the Abort Force? \n[7] \n[8]\n[9]Hey. Maybe we could shore up the MAV. Make tipping less likely. \n[10]We could use cables from the solar farm as guy lines. \n[11]The rovers could be anchors. The trick would be getting around the-- 6.  \n[12]Fuck. \n[13]Okay. Okay... \n[14]This is... Mark Watney. Astronaut. I am entering this log for the record, in case I... don't make it. It's... \n[15]oh-six-fifty-three on Sol 19. And... I'm still alive. Obviously. But I'm guessing this is going to be a surprise to my crewmates. And NASA. And... the world. So... surprise. I didn't die on Sol 18. Best I can tell - \n[16]-- this length of our primary communications antenna tore through my bio-monitor. And ripped a hole in me as well. It was horrible thank you for asking. But the antenna... and the blood... managed to seal the breach in my suit. Which kept me alive. Even though the team must have thought I was dead. Commander Lewis... If you ever hear this... Listen. It wasn't your fault. Just bad luck. You did what you had to do, and if I had been in your position I would have done the same. I'm glad you guys made it. All right, though. That's where we're at. Mark Watney, stranded on Mars. I have no way to contact NASA because our communications antenna broke and stuck into my stomach. Which we've covered. And even if I could, it will take... four years before the next manned mission gets here. And I'm in a Hab designed to last thirty-one days. If the oxygenator breaks, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I'll just sort of... implode. And if, by some miracle, none of that happens... eventually I'm going to run out of food. So... yeah. \n[17]Yeah. 16.  \n[18]Let's do the math... \n[19]Our surface mission here was supposed to take thirty-one days. For redundancy, they sent enough food to last for sixty- eight days. For six people. So for just me, it'll last three-hundred days. And I figure I can stretch that to four hundred if I ration. So... I've still gotta figure out how to grow three years worth of food. Here. On a planet where nothing grows. Luckily, I'm the botanist. \n[20]Mars will come to fear my botany powers. \n[21]The problem is water... \n[22]I've created one-hundred and twenty-six square meters of soil. But each cubic meter needs forty liters of water to be farmable. So, I gotta make a lot of water. Fortunately, I know the recipe. Take hydrogen. Add oxygen. Burn. Unfortunately... burn. I have hundreds of liters of unused Hydrazine from the MDV. If I run the Hydrazine over an iridium catalyst, it'll separate into N2 and H2... \n[23]Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire. 20.  \n[24]Believe it or not, the challenge has been finding something that will hold a flame. NASA hates fire. Because of the whole \"fire makes everyone die in space\" thing. So everything we brought with us is flame retardant. With the notable exception of... Martinez' personal items. \n[25]Sorry, Martinez. If you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet. \n[26]I figure God won't mind, considering the situation. \n[27]So. Yes. I blew myself up. Best guess? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I've been exhaling when I did my calculations. Because I'm stupid. 21.  \n[28]Interesting side note: this is how Jet Propulsion Laboratory was founded. Five guys at Cal Tech were trying to make rocket fuel and nearly burned down their dorm. Rather than expel them, Professor... Von Karman? I want to say... banished them to a nearby farm in Pasadena and told them to keep working. And now we have a space program. See? I pay attention. I'm gonna get back to work. As soon as my ears stop ringing. \n[29]I'm gonna die up here... \n[30]...if I have to listen to any more goddamn disco music. 29.  \n[31]Jesus, Commander Lewis, you couldn't have packed anything from this century? I'm not turning the beat around. I refuse to. \n[32]It's time to start thinking long term. The next NASA mission is Ares 4. It's supposed to land at the Schiaparelli Crater, 3,200 km away. \n[33]NASA presupplies each mission years in advance, so the MAV is already there, synthesizing fuel. In four years when the Hermes returns, I'll have to launch from there. Which means I gotta get to the crater. \n[34]But here's the rub. I've got two rovers designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before they need to be recharged at the Hab. That's problem A. Problem B is it'll take me... roughly fifty days to make the journey. So I have to be able to live for fifty days. Inside a rover with marginal life support the size of a small van. 30.  \n[35]And yeah, problem C is if I don't figure out how to make contact with NASA in the first place, none of this matters anyway. So... yes, in the face of overwhelming odds, I am left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this. \n[36]Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics.  I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen. \n[37]Good news: I may have a solution to my heating problem. \n[38]Bad news: it involves me digging up the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. 31.  \n[39]Now, if I remember my training correctly, one of the lessons was titled, \"Don't Dig Up The Big Box of Plutonium, Mark...\" \n[40]I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft, but if they rupture around humans... no more humans. Which is why we buried it when we arrived. And planted that flag so we would never be stupid enough to accidentally go near it again. \n[41]But. As long as I don't break it... I almost said \"everything will be fine\" out loud. My point is... \n[42]I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns. \n[43]It's been 48 sols since I planted the potatoes, so now its time to reap and re- sow. They grew even better than I expected. I now have 400 healthy potato plants. The smaller ones I'll re-seed. The larger ones are my food supply. All natural, organic, Martian-grown potatoes. You don't hear that every day, do you? But, by the way, none of this matters, at all, if I don't figure out how to make contact with NASA... \n[44]I know what I'm gonna do. \n[45]So here's the rub... \n[46]Somehow, we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera. From 1996. Luckily, the camera spins 360, so I can make an alphabet. I just can't use our alphabet. Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc. Too narrow. I wouldn't know what the camera was pointing at. So. Hexadecimals to the rescue... \n[47]I figured one of you guys kept an ASCII table somewhere... \n[48]Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you supernerd Beth Johanssen, who also had copies of Zork 2 and Leather Goddesses of Phobos on her laptop. Seriously, Johanssen... it's like the Smithsonian of loneliness on there... \n[49]Not that I'm complaining. \n[50]Now that NASA can talk to me, they won't shut up... \n[51]They've got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops. Which is awesome. Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant here, but I'm the best botanist on the planet. So. \n[52]In other news, there's been a request for me to pose for a picture on the next transmission. I'm debating between \"High School Senior...\" \n[53]And \"Coquettish Ingenue...\" \n[54]But I'm not sure how that will translate with the spacesuit on. One big bonus of this NASA communication: Email! Just like the days on the Hermes, I get data dumps. Not just friends and family, but NASA also sends choice messages from the public. Rock stars, athletes, even The President. The coolest one is from my alma mater, the University of Chicago. They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially \"colonized\" it. So, technically, I colonized Mars. In your face, Neil Armstrong. 49.  \n[55]\"Dear Martinez, Mars is fine. I accidentally blew up the Hab, but unfortunately all of Commander Lewis' disco music still survived.\" \n[56]So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what \"minimal calorie count\" looks like.  Standard issue ration. But instead of three every one day, I'm now eating one every three days. Oh good. Meatloaf. \n[57]This is today's allotment. Which I will supplement with potatoes. Which I am beginning to hate with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. And now I've been told to do this. \n[58]The point is, \"Stretch the rations four more days\" is a real dick-punch. \n[59]I'm dipping this potato in Vicodin and there's nothing anyone can do about it. \n[60]So, um. Commander Lewis. I need you to do something for me. If I die. I need you to check on my parents. They'll want to hear about our time on Mars first- hand. I'll need you to do that. It won't be easy talking to a couple about their dead son. It's a lot to ask; that's why I'm asking you. I'm not giving up. Just planning for every outcome. Please tell them I love what I do. And I'm really good at it. And I'm dying for something big and beautiful. And greater than me. 65.  \n[61] \n[62]We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled \"Das Core Samples\" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do. Why did we bring you? No idea. I'm trying to keep everything documented and organized. 74.  \n[63]I know that's not exactly my strong suit, but I want it all to make sense, in case... you know. Maybe you can teach it in class someday. The Watney Syllabus. \"How to Make a Bathtub Using NASA Tubing and an Old RTG.\" \"How to Cook a Potato Six-Thousand Different Ways.\" \"How to Make Water Out of Rocket Fuel. To Keep You Alive. For Just A Little Longer.\" \n[64]Every Ares mission requires three years of presupplies... \n[65]...so NASA figured out it's a lot easier to ship some of this stuff ahead of time rather than bring it with us. So, as a result, the MAV for Ares-4 is already waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And the plan is to use it to launch me into orbit just as the Hermes is passing. And then, I guess... they catch me? In space. \n[66]Anyway, that's not really my problem right now. First, I have to get there. And it's 3,200 kilometers away. So I have 200 sols to figure out how to bring everything here that's keeping me alive -- the Atmospheric Regulator, the Oxygenator, and the Water Reclaimer -- along for the ride. Luckily, I have the brainpower of the entire planet Earth helping me with this endeavor. So far we've come up with, \"Drill holes in the roof of your rover and then hit it with a rock.\" We'll get there. 81.  \n[67]I've been thinking about laws on Mars... \n[68]There's an international treaty saying no country can lay claim to anything that's not on Earth. \n[69]And by another treaty, if you're not in any country's territory, maritime law applies. So Mars is \"international waters.\" 85.  \n[70]NASA is an American non-military organization, and it owns the Hab. So, as soon as I step outside, I'm in international waters. \n[71]Here's the cool part. I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater, where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard the Ares 4. So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission. Which, by definition, makes me a pirate. Mark Watney, Space Pirate. \n[72]Everywhere I go, I'm the first. It's a strange feeling. \n[73]Step outside the rover? First guy to be there. Climb that hill? First guy to do that. \n[74]Four and a half billion years... nobody here. And now... me. I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet. \n[75]   \n[76] I do like it. I do like the way it sounds. Okay, fine. Let's do this. \n[77]It's good to hear your voice, Commander. I'm eager to get up to you. \n[78]Thank you for coming back for me. \n[79]Tell that asshole no barrel-rolls. \n[80]Go. 97.  \n[81]See you in a few, Commander. \n[82]MAV to Hermes -- \n[83]Affirmative, Commander. 101.  \n[84]My chest hurts. I think I broke some ribs. How are you? \n[85]Yeah. The canvas didn't hold... \n[86]I think it ripped early in the ascent. \n[87]How bad is it, Commander? \n[88]How big a problem? \n[89]Well. Shit. \n[90]Commander? 102.  \n[91]I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you. Since the source is on my arm, I could direct it pretty easy. \n[92]Those are very good points. But. \n[93]I would get to fly around like Iron Man. \n[94]Iron Man, Commander. Iron Man. \n[95]Did you say \"bomb?\" You guys are making a bomb without me? \n[96]Commander, I can't let you guys do this. I'm ready to puncture the suit. Let's go with the Iron Man plan. \n[97]The thing is, I'm selfish. And I want the memorials back home to be just me. I don't want the rest of you losers in them. Commander... call it off. \n[98] \n[99]You said 312? Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by. \n[100]Commander. Seriously. I got this. \n[101](having the time of his \n[102]Contact. \n[103]You have terrible taste in music. \n[104]Hi guys. \n[105]Oh. You know. Same old, same old. \n[106]I haven't showered in a year and a half. Cut me some slack. 113.  \n[107]I missed you guys. \n[108]Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. \n[109]Okay, let's see if I can get some of your questions out of the way up front. Yes, I did, indeed, survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own shit. It was even more disgusting than it sounds. Let's never speak of it again. 114.  \n[110]Question Two: \"When you were stranded and alone up there... did you think you were gonna die?\" \n[111]Yes. \n[112]And it'll happen to you, too. You should know that going in. It's space. It's filled with chance, circumstance, and bad luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some point, I promise, at some point every single thing is gonna go south on you, and you'll think: this is it. This is how I end. And you can either accept that... or you can get to work. \n[113]That's all it is. You simply begin. Solve one problem. Then the next one, then the next. You solve enough problems... and you get to come home. \n[114]All right. Questions? ", "Watney": "\n[1] \n[2] \n[3]Now that we can have more complicated conversations, the smart people at NASA have sent me instructions on how to hack the rover so that it can talk to Pathfinder.

Johanssen where did -- He was right in front of you last see him? me and then he was gone. He Lewis surveys the scene. Visibility is NEAR ZERO. She can barely see the people next to her. Tries to keep her heart from POUNDING out of her chest. \n[18]Okay... okay... Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch. Everyone else, home in on Johanssen. \n[19]Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him. 7.  \n[20]Copy that -- \n[21]Temperature normal? \n[22]Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over? 8.  \n[23]Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch. \n[24]I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch. \n[25]I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship.  \n[26]Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good? \n[27]What about the proximity radar? Could it detect Watney's suit? \n[28]Copy. Give it a try. \n[29]Copy. Martinez, try the radar. \n[30]Nothing? \n[31]Copy. On my way. \n[32]Launch. \n[33]Go ahead. \n[34]Copy. Coming to you. \n[35]You're in a hurry. \n[36] \n[37]I left him behind. \n[38]You were following orders. I left him behind. \n[39]...and the mission would conclude with Earth intercept 211 days later. \n[40]We ran the numbers. They check out. \n[41]NASA rejected the idea. They'd rather take a big risk on Watney than a small risk on all of us. Whoever snuck it in Vogel's email obviously disagreed. \n[42]Yes. If we do the maneuver, they'll have to send the supply ship or we'll die. We have the opportunity to force their hand. \n[43]If it were up to me, we'd already be on our way. 76.  \n[44]Not this time. This is something NASA expressly rejected. We're talking about mutiny. Which is not a word I use lightly. We do this together, or not at all. Before you answer, consider the consequences. If we mess up the supply rendezvous, we die. If we mess up the Earth gravity assist, we die. If we do everything perfectly, we add 533 days to our mission. 533 more days before we see our families again. 533 days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong. Something might break that we can't fix. If it's mission critical, we die. \n[45]Easy, cowboy. You and I are military. There's a good chance we'd be court- martialed when we got home. As for the rest of you, I guarantee they'll never send you up again. \n[46]Can you disable it? \n[47]It has to be unanimous. If anyone says no, that's it. We go home as planned. But I vote yes. \n[48]Johanssen? \n[49]Try it again. 92.  \n[50]Here's the plan... \n[51]Martinez will fly the MAV. Johanssen will sysop the ascent. Beck and Vogel, I want you in Airlock 2 with the outer door open before the MAV even launches. Once we reach intercept, it'll be Beck's job to get Watney. 93.  \n[52]Well, then it's a good thing you're our doctor. What's the intercept plan? \n[53]How fast a relative velocity can you handle? \n[54]We've got some leeway. The launch will be 52 minutes before the intercept and it takes 12 minutes. As soon as Mark's engine cuts out we'll know our intercept point and velocity. \n[55]Yes. It is. \n[56]Not an option. Vogel, you're Beck's backup. All goes well, you're pulling them back aboard with the tether. If things go wrong, you're going out after them. \n[57]All right. Let's go get our boy. \n[58]About two minutes, Watney. How you doing down there? \n[59]We're on the case. Remember, you'll be pulling some pretty heavy G's. It's okay to pass out. You're in Martinez' hands. 96.  \n[60]Copy that, MAV. CAPCOM... \n[61]Remote Command... \n[62]Recovery... \n[63]Secondary recovery... \n[64] \n[65]Pilot... \n[66]Mission control, this is Hermes actual. We are go for launch, and will proceed on schedule. 10 seconds to launch... mark. \n[67]About five seconds, Watney. Hang on. \n[68]That's too low -- \n[69]Watney? Watney, do you read? Can you report? \n[70]How far below? \n[71]Watney? Do you read? 99.  \n[72]Copy. \n[73]Keep it together. Work the problem. Martinez, do we have any juice in the \n[74]Then we have to go him. Johanssen, time to intercept? \n[75]What if we point our attitude thrusters all the same direction? \n[76]How much do you need? \n[77]\n[78]Do it. \n[79]Then we have 39 minutes to figure out how to slow down. Martinez, burn the jets. \n[80]Watney?! \n[81]What's your status? \n[82]We're working on getting you. There was a complication during launch. \n[83]That's consistent with what we saw. \n[84]We've corrected the intercept range, but we've got a problem with the intercept velocity. \n[85]42 meters per second. \n[86]Go ahead, Mark. \n[87]I can't see you having any control if you did that. You'd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control. \n[88]We should have left him on Mars. \n[89]Maybe it's not the worst idea. \n[90]Not his part. But using atmosphere as thrust...  Martinez, get Vogel's station up and running... 103.  \n[91]I need to know what happens if we blow the VAL. \n[92]It would give us a good kick. \n[93]We'll seal the bridge and reactor room. We let everywhere else go vacuo. \n[94]We don't have to. The VAL is in the nose. We just point the ship at Mark. \n[95]Beck -- you hearing this? \n[96]Right... right... Vogel? \n[97]Take your suit off. I need you to come back in and make a bomb. \n[98]You're the chemist. Can you make a bomb with what we've got on board? \n[99]Copy that. Can you do it? \n[100]Houston, be advised: we are going to deliberately breach the VAL to produce thrust. 105.  \n[101]Beck -- leave your suit on. Meet Johanssen at Airlock 1. We'll open the outer door. I need you to place the charge on the inner door... \n[102]...and climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull. \n[103]Absolutely not. \n[104]Oh. Okay. Well, if you want us to call it off, then I guess we have to oh wait... wait a minute. Yep. I'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out I'm Commander. So shut up. \n[105]What's the new intercept distance? Johanssen. \n[106]That's too far... \n[107]The intercept distance is gonna be too far. I'm going untethered. \n[108]It's not a debate, Beck. I'm not risking another crew member. 108.  \n[109]Johanssen, time to VAL blow? \n[110]We sure know how to cut it close. \n[111]Brace for deceleration. \n[112]Worry about that later... What's our relative velocity? \n[113]Copy. \n[114]What's our intercept range? \n[115]I have visual on the MAV -- \n[116]Mark -- you're still WAY TOO FAR -- I'm not gonna make it -- \n[117]Johanssen -- what's my relative velocity to Mark? \n[118]Copy.

And we're going too fast at this point to fall into orbit, so it's a flyby. \n[15]And we head back home. I've done the math. It checks out. 70.  \n[16]Yes sir?

I don't want my Commander to die too. \n[11]Let it tip. We can't leave her. \n[12]Commander. You need to get back to the ship. Now. \n[13]Holy shit. Commander! He's alive! \n[14]We all left together. \n[15]Why all the cloak and dagger? \n[16]If we go for it... how would it work? \n[17]Johanssen used to go by the hacker handle \"Lady Sorrow\" in high school. Just so we're all on the same page. \n[18]Let's go get him. \n[19]He might be in bad shape. The stripped down MAV will get up to 12 g's during the launch. He could be knocked unconscious and may have internal bleeding. \n[20]We finished attaching the tethers into one long line. It's 214 meters long. I'll have the MMU, so moving around should be easy. \n[21]Once I get to Mark? I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second. 10 is like jumping onto a moving train. Any more than that and I might miss. \n[22]Good. And 214 meters isn't a hard limit, per se. \n[23]I take off the tether, I could get way out to -- \n[24]Go. \n[25]He's probably passed out. He pulled 12 G's on the ascent. Give him a few minutes. \n[26]I can make that work. \n[27]Did she say 68 kilometers? Kilometers? \n[28]Copy. On my way. \n[29]Bomb is set.

I don't know what this looks like. Math equations. Does this make any sense to you? \n[24]Are we gonna do it? \n[25]Remote Override. They can take over the Hermes from Mission Control. \n[26]Hermes has four redundant flight computers, each connected to three redundant comm systems. We can't shut down the comms; we'd lose telemetry and guidance. We can't shut down the computers; we need to control the ship. I'd have to disable the Remote Override on each system... It's part of the OS, I'd have to jump over the code... 77.  \n[27]Beck is a liar. And he should keep our conversations private. But, yeah.

That'll bring the intercept range to zero. \n[44]Hang on -- that gets the range to zero, but the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second -- \n[45]And... all the air would leave. And we need air. To not die. \n[46]Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second. \n[47]Bomb? \n[48]How do we activate it? \n[49]Make sure you're not still here when this goes off. \n[50]\n[51]Be careful.

My answer is \"Eh.\" And yes, I'm going to make everyone forget there's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that's what you pay me for and unfortunately I need this job because I'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass. 33.  \n[11]I left them. \n[12]No more Vincent on television.
