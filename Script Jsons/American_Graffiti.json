Ah, I think we'd better have a talk. I've gotten- \n[4]Now, Steve! Let her wait. \n[5]Yeah, well... Listen... I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow. \n[6]I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city-- \n[7]Wait, let me explain-- \n[8]I just want some time to think. What's the rush? I'll go next year. \n[9]Why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? Or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I've been searching for all my life? \n[10]Hey, John. Someone new in town. \n[11]You gonna go after him? \n[12]The big shot! \n[13]Hey, sis--what's wrong? \n[14]What's wrong, he's crying! \n[15]I'd like to, Toad, but I'm going with Steve and Laurie to the hop. I'd just slow you down anyway. \n[16]Yeah. \n[17]You ain't got no emotions? \n[18]Why don't you come with us? \n[19]Come on. For old time's sake. \n[20]What's the matter John? Did I say somethin' wrong? I'm sorry. \n[21]Well, we'll see you later, okay? \n[22]We'll all do somethin' together. You know, before Steve leaves. \n[23]I don't know. \n[24]What? \n[25] \n[26]Quick! Hang a right! \n[27]Cut over to G Street, I've just seen a vision! She was a goddess. You've got to catch her! \n[28]I'm telling you, this was the most perfect, dazzling creature I've ever seen. \n[29]She spoke to me. She spoke to me, right through the window. I think she said, \"I love you.\" \n[30]That means nothing to you people? You have no romance, no soul? She-- someone wants me. Someone roaming the streets wants me! Will you turn the corner? \n[31](grinning as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes \n[32]No, not yet. I have no matches. \n[33]Blotto. \n[34] \n[35]And only stayed a semester. \n[36]Why? \n[37]Well, you know I might find I'm not the competitive type myself. \n[38]Well, I'm not really sure that I'm going. \n[39]Jane... \n[40]Yeah... I'll see you. Thanks a lot. \n[41]Well--hey, Wendy. \n[42]Fine. Great.

You're thinking of someone else. \n[56]What cruel fate keeps me from my true love? How am I ever going to meet her? \n[57]Maybe I've grown up. Maybe I've changed my mind. \n[58]Maybe you should shut up! \n[59]Why don't you move your bod into aft chamber, where we might discuss this in private. \n[60]Come on, Wendy? She doesn't say anything. They pull up to a stoplight. Wendy looks at the red stoplight and then abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back. \n[61]To the Opera, James. \n[62]Unless you want to go to Gallo Dam and have an orgy. \n[63]Maybe. \n[64]Huh? Yeah, I know him. \n[65]What do you want me to say? \n[66]Kip, baby, what's up? \n[67]Not much, just wanted to let you know that Bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps... \n[68]Help, wait!

Whimps get all the snatch. \n[83]Hey, terrific, I love miniature golf. \n[84]Well, I don't play that often really. Ah--what're we doing here then? \n[85]They don't sell gas here. \n[86]Curt. \n[87]Hey, hi. Mr. Gordon, what's up? \n[88]These are my friends.

Aren't you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime? \n[113]No--no realizing. You've been telling me all summer that it's time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big, beautiful world out there. Gimme this thing. \n[114](banging the Citroen hood shut \n[115]Wrong nothing. You've been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks.

I want to ask him something that-- \n[121]Listen, I got a right to talk to him. I listened to him every night for as long--for twelve years almost.

I may be leaving town tomorrow, and it's very important that I--damn it, that I reach this girl right now. \n[129]Well, I'm supposed to go to college back East tomorrow. And I don't know if I'm gonna go. \n[130]No, thank you. \n[131]Why don't you leave? \n[132]That'd be great. Thanks.

If you throw me out I'll scream. \n[6]Hey, is this what they call copping a feel? \n[7]What's your name? \n[8]So the next night we found out where they parked and went out with ammunition. \n[9]No sweat--my mother does it. Anyway, he thought he was had. He started the car and couldn't see through the windshield--and zoomed straight into the canal--it was a riot. \n[10]I still got some, so don't try anything. \n[11]Spare me, killer. \n[12]Why'd you do that? \n[13]Don't you think the Beach Boys are boss! \n[14]Grungy?

Break my arm, see if I care. \n[46]I was just going to keep it for a little while. You're an ogre, just like my father. He won't let me play records, or stay out late, or anything. \n[47]No--he's terrible. Once I was at a party that didn't end till late and he called the cops. Can you imagine? It was only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force-- \n[48]Over on Ramona, why? Oh no. Uh uh. You thought I'd tell you where--not me, not old Carol.

So long, goodbye, hasta lumbago. \n[62]All right, one coke and then home. \n[63]Don't count on it. I may surprise you any minute now. \n[64] \n[65]Probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime. \n[66]Oh Shit, Dee Dee! \n[67]Have to be before noon. \n[68]No. Hi--ahh, this is my, ahh, cousin, Carol. I'm kinda babysitting tonight. \n[69]Jesus--watch it, will yuh? Been hittin' me all night. Kids will be kids, you know. \n[70]Watch out--damn it! Look what--why don't you grow up! We don't get along too well. It's been like this-- \n[71]We don't get along too well. You know what cousins are like. \n[72]That's Freddy Benson's Vette... he got his head on with some drunk. Never had a chance. Damn good driver, too. What a waste when somebody gets it and it ain't even their fault. \n[73]That Vette over there. Walt Hawkins, a real ding-a-ling. Wrapped it around a fig tree out on Mesa Vista with five kids in it. Draggin' with five kids in the car, how dumb can you get? All the ding-a-lings get it sooner or later. Maybe that's why they invented cars. To get rid of the ding-a-lings. Tough when they take someone with them. \n[74]I come pretty close a couple of times. Almost rolled once. So far I've been quick enough to stay out of here. The quick and the dead. \n[75]I've never been beaten--lot of punks have tried. See that '41 Ford there? Used to be the fastest wheels in the valley. I never got a chance to race old Earl. He got his in '55 in the hairiest crash ever happened around here. He was racing a '54 Chevy, bored and loaded, out on the old Oakdale Highway and every damn kid in town was out there. The Chevy lost its front wheel doing about 85. The idiot had torched the spindles to lower the front end and it snapped right off. He slammed bam into the Ford and then they both of them crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin! Jesus, eight kids killed including both drivers, looked like a battlefield. Board of Education was so impressed they filmed it. Show it now in Drivers Education, maybe you'll see it. Anyway, since then street racing's gone underground. No spectators, I mean. Too bad. \n[76]Come on! None of that. \n[77]Funny... Who knows, in a few years--but not now, bunny rabbit. \n[78]Come on, open the door. \n[79] \n[80]You got two seconds to get your ass over in the corner. \n[81]If the prize is you, honey, I'm a ready Teddy. \n[82]Hey, wait a-- \n[83]Yezz, bozz.... \n[84]Come on, will ya? Give it back to me. \n[85]Forget it. \n[86] \n[87]Say, where do you live anyway? \n[88]Grab onto something. \n[89] \n[90]Hey, I can't keep tracka all the punks lookin' for me. \n[91]Ya should, man--you're driving a field car. \n[92]Field Cars drive through the fields, dropping cow shit all over the place to make the lettuce grow. \n[93]Yeah, well, you're car's so ugly you must have to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas. \n[94]Look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me. \n[95]Leave her out of this. This is just between you and me. \n[96]Yeah. But he's stupid. \n[97] \n[98]I--I don't think that I can control myself any longer. \n[99]No... Carol, I've got to have you. \n[100]All night you've been sitting there and you've been so sexy and it's been so hot--and I can't wait any more... \n[101]Well, it's been building up inside of me like a volcano, all night. Maybe if I knew where you lived I could fight it--I could take you home--but since you won't tell me, and since here we are--I've got to have you. It's too late-- \n[102] \n[103]This the first time you've been quiet all night. \n[104]Yeah. I like you. You're all right. \n[105]I, ah... I like you. Okay? \n[106]'Bye, kid. \n[107]Yeah. \n[108]Wait a minute, now. \n[109]Don't go overboard with this thing. \n[110]Yeah. Think so. There's some punk lookin' for me. \n[111]Yeah... it's been a long time, ain't it? I'll see ya. Thanks. \n[112]Hey, man, you all right? \n[113] \n[114]What happened, man? \n[115]What's wrong, Toad? You lose the car again? \n[116]Naw, man. I can't take you when I'm racin' somebody. \n[117]All right. Go ahead. \n[118]Paradise Road. \n[119]Hey--Laurie, what in the hell are you doing in there? Is she gonna ride with you? \n[120]Come on, before she blows. \n[121]He was faster. \n[122]I was losin', man. \n[123]He had me, man. He was pullin' away from me just before he crashed. \n[124]You saw it. \n[125]Shit, Toad. The man had me. He was beating me. \n[126]Look at your glasses, man. Okay, Toad. We'll take 'em all. \n[127]We'll take em... let's get out of here. \n[128]I know, you probably think you're a big shot, goin' off like this--but you're still a punk. ", "Wendy": "\n[1]What are you doin', stealing hub caps? \n[2]How've you been? \n[3]I'm coming--wait a sec. She's got her car. Hey, I thought you were going away to school. \n[4]Same old Curt. All the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing... well, anyway, I gotta go. \n[5]Nowhere. \n[6] \n[7]What's wrong with you? You know Bobbie gets nose bleeds when she's upset. \n[8]Eat your heart out. Who was she anyway? \n[9]Mr. Beeman's not so old. \n[10] \n[11]Maybe you don't think you can do it! \n[12]Maybe I will... and maybe I won't. \n[13]Well, slide over, I'm not sitting on your lap. \n[14]You wish. \n[15]I've been silly. I'm glad you're going to stay. Maybe we'll have some classes together. \n[16]Curt, I hope I see you at registration. Call me if you want. It was nice seeing you again. ", "Ants": "\n[1]Tie him to the car and drag him. \n[2]Tied him to a car and dragged him. \n[3]No, I called it! \n[4]Before we picked you up. \n[5]Ah, man--they'll never catch the Wolfman. \n[6]Hey, man, who cut the cheese? \n[7]Hey, man, he looks like a whimp. \n[8]Thirty dollars ain't much. I saw ten thousand once. My old man had it in a suitcase. They caught him the next morning though. \n[9]That's rotten, man. Hiding like that. \n[10]I seen a little kid attacked by pigs once, but this was even better. ", "Budda": "\n[1]A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. Anything else you want, Steve? If there is you let me know now. Just honk and I'm yours. \n[2]One fries--grab it before I drop it. \n[3]He didn't dump on me, you little dip. Hi, Steve! \n[4]You've got to be kidding! \n[5]Hi. You mind if I sit down? \n[6]I got five minutes outa the rat race, and I saw you all alone. For a change. \n[7]Where's Laurie? \n[8]I thought the two of you'd be going strong, this being your last night and everything-- \n[9]Wow... what happened? \n[10]Nothing. Just thinking. A girl like Laurie--I mean, she goes to school and is cute and popular and all, but we're not so different. We know what we want. I've seen her after you for two years now. \n[11]Maybe not. She does have a different approach. Hers is \"Never surrender,\" me I lay down my arms at the drop of a hat-- \n[12] \n[13]Why don't you? I never got a chance to talk to you. You're leaving tomorrow. Listen, I gave up a long time ago, so it'd be just for fun. No problems. \n[14]I'll see ya later then. \n[15]She's got you so brainwashed--well, hell. Some day I'm gonna win. Don't ya think? ", "Carlos": "\n[1]Shotgun! \n[2]When? \n[3]You can't call it for the whole night, man. I got it now. Get in the back. \n[4]You tell her, Wolfman. He's my man. When I graduate, I'm gonna be a Wolfman. Hey, you know he broadcasts out of Mexico someplace? \n[5]That's just a clearing station, man. So he can fool the cops. He blasts that thing all the way around the world. It's against the law, man. \n[6]Milner ain't gonna beat that. His time has come. He's getting old. He ain't as fast as he used to be. \n[7]Hey man, don't tell Joe what he thinks. \n[8]Fuzz ahead, watch it. \n[9]Fuzz ahead, watch it. \n[10]At Jerrie's Cherries.

I mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out. \n[5]I know. I just sort of think it's juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. It's less conspicuous there. \n[6]I didn't say that. I understand and I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away. \n[7]Nothing. \n[8]   \n[9]We're not going to spend the night chasing girls for you. \n[10]I don't want to go out with anybody else. \n[11]I just wish I could go with him or something. \n[12]Come on what? \n[13]No thanks. \n[14]Who's stopping you? \n[15]How sentimental. You'll be back at Christmas. \n[16]Get your cooties off me-- \n[17]Go ahead, slug me, scar my face. I wouldn't dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym. \n[18]I'll dance with you, Eddie. You don't mind, do you, Peggy? \n[19]I don't care if you leave this second. \n[20]Oh God, come on. \n[21](pulling him toward the floor \n[22]You think I care if you go off. You think I'm going to crack up or something. Are you conceited! \n[23]You take me out? When we first met you didn't have enough sense to take the garbage out... I asked you out, remember? \n[24]Backwards Day--remember? If I had waited for you to ask me--even after that you didn't call me for two weeks. \n[25]You were scared. Dave Oboler told me. Then when you did ask me out you didn't kiss me for three dates. \n[26]Scared--Jim Kaylor told me. I even asked my father why you hadn't kissed me. \n[27]He said he thought you were bright and you'd probably think of kissing me after a while. \n[28]You didn't, of course. I had to. Remember that picnic? \n[29]Oh boy! You can't remember anything-- the first one, up at the lake. That was the first time you kissed me--I practically had to throw myself at you. \n[30]Go to hell. \n[31] \n[32]Yeah, hard tough. \n[33]   \n[34]You know, it doesn't make sense to leave home to look for a home, to give up a life to find a new life, to say goodbye to friends you love just to find new friends. \n[35]That's what Curt said. \n[36]That's not true. I didn't say anything. Curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry. He thought he should take it easy for a while, go to J.C. and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life. \n[37]You think so? \n[38]I'm not going to the airport tomorrow. \n[39]Steve! Don't. \n[40]We've been through this before. \n[41] \n[42]Well go ahead, you want to. \n[43]If you're not going to remember me for anything else, why don't you go ahead? \n[44]You're disgusting! Get out of my car! I told you never-- \n[45]Get out! It's not worth it. I don't care if you're leaving--now get out! \n[46]Just don't say anything and we'll get along fine. \n[47]You just follow this street straight out of town... Listen, if you're gonna race John Milner, you can let me out right when we get there. \n[48]Mind your own business, John. \n[49]I said I didn't--you lousy greasy jerk! You coulda killed me--what's wrong with you. You clubfoot... \n[50]No, no, no. Please, don't come near me. No, please. I think I'm gonna be sick. Oh, Steven. \n[51]Oh, Steven!

Bring him over here, Ants, I want to show him something. \n[7]Here--bend down, look here. See that? Right across there--see? \n[8]You scratched it, man. Where do you get off sitting on Gil's car, huh, man? \n[9]It ain't the size that's in question here. It's the principle. Jeez, this is tough... what should we do with ya? \n[10]Toby Juarez. Yeah, sure we know Toby. \n[11]Sure, good old Toby. He's a friend of yours. That's cool... we all hate his guts. \n[12]We killed him last night. \n[13]This is going to take some thinking. You better come with us maybe. Go riding with the Pharoahs... \n[14]I know just how ya feel. \n[15]No, he don't. I seen the station right outside of town. \n[16]He who smelt it, dealt it. Hey, creep, scoot down. Sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know what I mean? \n[17]There's that badass Chevy again. Look at he snatch he's got with him. \n[18]I hate it. \n[19]We're outta gas. \n[20]No... but we're outta money, too.

My brother's been with her and he clued me in. \n[27]Yeah, Thirty Dollar Sheri. Can you believe that? Thirty dollars. \n[28]Where? \n[29]Where? \n[30]It's dishonest. \n[31]We oughta do something. I got an idea. I got a good idea. \n[32]Listen, ah--Carl, I-- \n[33]Curt. \n[34]Despite you scratching Gil's car, I like you. And I know what you'd like more than anything right now. Like every guy in town, you got the same secret dream, right? \n[35]Ya want to join the Pharoahs. Huh? You can admit it--you'd like to--but you never dreamed it could be possible, did you? \n[36]Well, tonight, I'm goin' to give you your chance. \n[37]Get down! \n[38]Okay. Now you got it? I'm stayin' here. You're on your own. \n[39]Shhh. Listen. Look at it this way: Now you got three choices. One, you chicken out. In that case, I let Ants tie you to the car and drag you around a little bit. And you don't want that, right? \n[40]Two, you foul up and Holstein hears you and well, ah... you don't want that, right? \n[41]Three, you are successful and you join the Pharoahs with a carcoat, and the blood initiation and all that, huh? \n[42]Hey, you sure you got enough slack? \n[43]Oh mother, it's been a glorious night. \n[44]Oh boy, I'll tell you something, that car must've jumped five feet in the air! \n[45]You sure you got to go? The night's young. \n[46]I think she was an optical delusion, man. Psychology-wise it ain't good to dwell on it. You'll alter your ego or something. Anyway, catch ya tomorrow night? \n[47]Guess so? Man, we don't admit a lot of guys to the Pharoahs. You understand we're going to have to swipe your jacket and all--you gotta make up your mind. \n[48]Sure--listen, remember, Rome wasn't buried in a night. "}}
