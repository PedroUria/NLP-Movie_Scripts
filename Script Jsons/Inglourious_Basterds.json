Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather their coats, and file out.     \n[3]still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty. The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman, who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in one of the cinema's opera box balconies. Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in the empty cinema. The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into \n[4]May I sleep here tonight? \n[5]No. \n[6]Murdered.     3 1. \n[7]We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us \n[8]Oui. \n[9]You can run the machines? \n[10]The machines that show the film? \n[11]I know, I saw you. \n[12]eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth, watching... \n[13] \n[14]Teach me. Teach me to run the machines, that show the film. It's only you and the negro. I know you could use some help.     40. \n[15]A week, and a few days. \n[16]I sleep on rooftops. \n[17]Cold. \n[18]Respectfully, no you can't. \n[19]Oui. \n[20]Shosanna.     \n[21]Oui Madame. \n[22]THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE. As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect... \n[23]A Max Linder festival. \n[24]No need, I can manage. \n[25]Merci. \n[26]Merci. She busies herself with the marquee letters... \n[27] \n[28] \n[29]My aunt left it to me. \n[30]I don't have a choice, but your welcome. \n[31]Oui. \n[32]\"Admire\", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal. \n[33]I'm French. We respect directors in our country. \n[34]Even Germans. Merci for assistance, Private. Adieu. She turns to go back inside. \n[35]I'll finish in the morning. She opens the door to go inside. \n[36]You wish to see my papers? She hands him her excellently forged papers. That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name. \n[37]Merci. Are you finished with my papers? He hands them back. \n[38]Oui, Madame. \n[39]Out, Madame. \n[40]Out, Madame. \n[41]Even on the roof I can't smoke a cigarette without hearing Madames voice yelling at me. That's why I do it. To hear Madames voice again. \n[42]I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be to bed soon. Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes. \n[43]Look Fredrick - \n[44]Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant enough fellow - \n[45]Your welcome. - regardless, I want you to stop pestering me. \n[46]I don't wish to be your friend.     \n[47]Don't act like a infant. You know why. \n[48]Not to me. If you are so desperate for a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy? Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German speaking members of the movies audience, can understand. He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they go on their way. Shosanna's eyes narrow. \n[49]Who are you? \n[50]Your not just a German soldier, are you somebodies son? \n[51]Yeah, but your not just somebody. What are you, Hitlers nephew? He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says; \n[52]Really? \n[53]Then what is it? What are you, a German movie star?     \n[54], what does that mean, \"not exactly\". I asked if you were a movie star, the answer to that question, is yes or no. Fredrick laughs at that line. \n[55]You were raised by Helga? \n[56]And your mother and father? \n[57]is your cinema still operatiing? \n[58]What's it called?     5! \n[59]How has it done durring the war? \n[60]No doubt, you don't have to operate under a curfew. \n[61], not since before the war. \n[62]Of course, but that's not likely to happen. TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks. \n[63]So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me? \n[64]What did you do? He takes a sip of beer. \n[65]Wow.     52 \n[66]What's a bird's nest? \n[67]How many Russian's did you kill? \n[68]Maybe they'll make a film about your exploits. \n[69]\"Nation's Pride\" is about you? \"Nation's Pride\" is starring you? \n[70]Not so comical. So what are you doing in Paris, enjoying a rest?     53. \n[71]Well, good luck with your premier Private. I hope all goes well for Joseph and yourself. Au revoir. And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private alone. \n[72]Oui? Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French; \n[73] \n[74]I don't understand, what have I done? \n[75]Then I demand to know what this is about, and where do you propose to take me? The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German;     55. \n[76]the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything. The sedan stops. The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand. \n[77]Invitation? \n[78]Bon jour.     \n[79] \n[80] \n[81]Three hundred and fifty. \n[82]My cinema , on German night, tends to show older German classics. Francesca interprets... \n[83]I draw a older German audience in my cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time. Francesca interprets... \n[84]A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she gives any indication of this, her war story ends here. The S.S. OFFICER that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it, saying in perfect French; \n[85]No. \n[86]  \n[87]Oui. \n[88]The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket. \n[89]Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux. He records the names in his little book. \n[90]My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg. \n[91]Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.' \n[92]Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He's the only other one who works with me. \n[93]Projectionist. \n[94]The best.     61. \n[95]Of course I can. \n[96]Oui. Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit. \n[97]Private Zollers feelings for me aren't of a romantic nature. \n[98]Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister. \n[99]I remind him of his sister who raised him.     70 \n[100]No thank you. \n[101]Yes. \n[102]watching the screen. The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack. \n[103]watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in disbelief.     73 \n[104]in the lobby, post screening of \"Lucky Rids\", she's soundlessly escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes. \n[105]It looks like we're suppose to have a Nazi premier. \n[106]Well, I need to speak with you about that. \n[107]About these Hun swine, commandeering our cinema. \n[108]Well, when I was watching the bosch (Said in \n[109]Filling the cinema with Nazi's and their whores, and burning it down to the ground. \n[110]No, we're talking about that, right now. If we can keep this place from burning down by ourselves, we can burn it down by ourselves. \n[111]No, Marcel, just for sake of argument, if we wanted to burn down the cinema, for any number of reasons, you and I could physically accomplish that, no? \n[112]And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate film print collection, we wouldn't even need explosives, would we? \n[113]Oui, that's exactly what I mean. She begins kissing his hands.     75. \n[114]  \n[115]  \n[116]  \n[117]  \n[118]Because Marcel, my sweet, we're going to make a film. Just for the Nazi's. \n[119]What is a sync mark? \n[120]How do we do that? \n[121]Ready. \n[122] \n[123]Do you know one person who can do both things? \n[124]In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're going to obliterate the Nazi's, we have to use their tactics. \n[125]We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print. And we make them do it, or we kill them. Once we tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway, or they'll turn us in. \n[126]Like that. Snaps her fingers.     \n[127]Bring that fucker over here! Put his head down on that table. Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat against the table top. Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face. \n[128]You ether do what the fuck we tell you to, or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull. \n[129]Then prove it! Or does your manhood go no deeper, then standing to piss? Marcel, does his wife, and children know you? \n[130]Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them. She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high... \n[131]Prepare to die, collaborator fucker! \n[132]We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the cinema. We've never been in here before. \n[133]Shut up fool. Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips meet. \n[134]Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let's go over it again? \n[135]Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!     12 1. \n[136]  \n[137]Bon jour. \n[138]  \n[139]Prego. \n[140]Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and dominated by a desk. They both enter. Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT. Bridget notices, but says nothing. Now the two Germans are alone. \n[141]She removes \"REEL 4\" , and prepares it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector, playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's going to be show time. Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; \n[142]What are you doing here? \n[143]Can't you see how busy I am? \n[144]Fredrick it's not funny, you can't be here. This is your premiere, you need to be out there with them. As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.     \n[145]Fredrick, I am sorry, but - \n[146]Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring the way. \n[147]I have to get prepared for the reel change.     \n[148]No. \n[149]I said, no. \n[150]Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing your ass, you've forgotten what the word,\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0No\" means? No Fredrick, you can't come in here, now go away! No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it. He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room. Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it. The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick; \n[151]Fredrick, you hurt me. \n[152]Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the door. \n[153] \n[154]HITS the DUSTY ground HARD, NOT in slow motion... \n[155]on floor, eyes close, last breath blown into dusty projection booth floor. Like her family befor her, dead from Nazi bullets. \n[156]CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background , SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells \"1984\" Big Brother. HITLER and GOEBBELS React. \n[157] \n[158]She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says in FRENCH; \n[159]I have a message for Germany. I'm interrupting your Nazi propaganda horse shit, to inform you despicable German swine, that your all going to die. HITLER and GOEBBELS react. \n[160]And I want you to look deep in the face of The Jew who's going to do it. \n[161]My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel, \n[162]and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema. The AUDIENCE STAMPEDES towards the exits... ", "Marcel": "\n[1]Are you well?     \n[2]We both miss her. \n[3]What the fuck are we suppose to do? \n[4]Like I said, what the fuck are we suppose to do? \n[5]About what? \n[6]What about it? She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders. Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.     \n[7]I'm confused, what are we talking about? \n[8]I'm not talking about that, your talking about that. \n[9]Shosanna - \n[10]Oui Shosanna, we could do that. \n[11]You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives? \n[12]Quite well, actually. I recorded a new guitarist I met in a cafe last week. It works superb. Why do we need filmmaking equipment? \n[13]We need a sync mark. \n[14]A action and noise put together, So we can sync up the picture and sound. \n[15]Clap your hands. She does. \n[16]In frame imbecile. She claps her hands in front of her face. \n[17]Ready? Shosanna takes a deep breath, then; \n[18]Action. \n[19] \n[20]But how do we get it developed? Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get a35mm print with a soundtrack? \n[21]Of course Gaspar, very nice man, took care of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their right mind would strike a print of what your talking about. If the Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't be worth this. He snaps his fingers. \n[22]What does that mean? \n[23]Would you do that? \n[24]Oui. \n[25]We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the cinema. We've never been in here before. \n[26]Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting. Pleased to meet you. \n[27]Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two is on the second. Three and four are ready to go. \n[28]It's time. I should go lock the auditorium, and take my place behind the screen. This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I die wet one on her. \n[29]He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth, into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors, and peers inside. \n[30]in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to Fredrick's exploits on screen. Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT. \n[31]smiles. ", "Major": "\n[1]Mademoiselle Nimieux? \n[2]Ask her if this is her cinema? in French The Driver asks Shosanna; \n[3]Tell her to come down. \n[4]Who says she's done anything? \n[5]Get your ass in that car. No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car, followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off. \n[6]Actually, I didn't introduce myself.  Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at your service mademoiselle. (he clicks his heels Please allow me, have a seat. The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine from a small craft on the table. \n[7]Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good. Goebbels looks across the table at her. \n[8]Duly noted. Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna; \n[9]Better known as \"The Jew Hunter\". The table laughs. \n[10]Smiling, smoking a French cigarette. \n[11]Like the young newly christened father, I too have a acute ear for accents. And like him, I too find yours odd.

Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of \n[7]You are right.     \n[8] Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them. The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home. \n[9]Oui. \n[10]By all means. They now speak ENGLISH; \n[11]Yes. \n[12]Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk. \n[13]I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles. \n[14]But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing. \n[15]To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers. \n[16]Only rumors - \n[17]Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain. \n[18]Yes. \n[19]We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question. \n[20]There were five of them. The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram... her brother, Bob ... \n[21]Thirty - thirty one? \n[22]And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna. \n[23]Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna, was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really sure. \n[24] \n[25]But of course. Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass, German Officer talks. \n[26]I have no interest in such things. \n[27]I'm aware. \n[28]That they call you, \"The Jew Hunter\". \n[29]I suppose I would. \n[30]Rat's spread disease, they bite people - \n[31]No. \n[32]It is a interesting thought, beer Colonel. \n[33]Probably not. \n[34]Please, Cononel, make yourself at home.     13. The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings. The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a \"S\" shaped goard kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes. A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table. \n[35]To protect my family. \n[36]Yes. \n[37]Yes. \n[38]Yes . \n[39]Yes. Colonel Landa stands up from the table, and switching to FRENCH says ", "LaPadite": "\n[1]The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap, inside the Frenchman's home. Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife, and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction. The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.     ", "Joseph": "", "Goebbels": "\n[1]- it's only the off spring of slaves that allows America to be competitive athletically. America olympic gold can measured in Negro sweat. Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major. Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself, and greets her before she reaches the table. Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; \n[2]Your reputation precedes you Fraulein Mimieux. He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big bite of terri misu. They all laugh. Fredrick jumps in... \n[3]well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy. Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna. \n[4]I must say fraulein, I should be rather annoyed with you. Francesca interprets.. \n[5]I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star... Francesca interprets... \n[6]Little do I know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me. Francesca interprets...     c9 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00a2 \n[7]People wait in line hours, day's, to see me. For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait. Francesca interprets... \n[8]So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema. Francesca interprets... \n[9]So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business. Private Zoller interrupts - \n[10]Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her. Francesca tells Shosanna in French; \n[11] \n[12]Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change. \n[13]You have opera boxes? \n[14] \n[15]More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium? \n[16]That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz. Fredrick jumps in... \n[17]I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I've created a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war's over, politics awaits. Table chuckles. \n[18]Well Private, though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything. I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no.  So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me. Francesca interprets... \n[19]What German films do you have? Francesca asks.. \n[20]Why not my films? Francesca asks...     \n[21]That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans are looking forward, not backwards. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe. But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood. Fredrick Jumps in... \n[22]WSo it would appear. Unfortunately for the fraulein, I've outlawed film criticism. Zoller, thinking fast, says; \n[23]Ahhh, \"Lucky Kids\", \"Lucky Kids\", \"Lucky Kids\". When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I wouldn't be surprised, if sixty years from now, It's \"Lucky Kids\" that I'm the most remembered for. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but mark my words. Very well, I'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'.s cinema. We'll screen \"Lucky Kids\" tonight.     63 As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna... ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform. \n[24]Ah Landa, your here, this is the young lady in question. The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the first scene COL HANS LANDA. \n[25]Oh Francesca, what was that funny thing the Fuhrer said about Hans? \n[26]You know, you were there, it was a funny thing the Fuhrer said, about Hans...Something about a pig? Francesca's memory is jogged. \n[27]Oh, yes of course, that's it. So the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be surprised if Hans weren't rooting out Jews like a truffle pig from the play pen. \n[28]Do you have a engagement tonight? \n[29]- Break it. We're all going to the Fraulein's cinema tonight to view \"Lucky Kids\". \n[30]Slave driver! French slave driver! They all chuckle. Everybody begins to stand up from the table... ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs... .as Col Landa stands, he says; \n[31]Hans, the boy means no harm, he's simply smitten. And he's correct. Your reputation does proceed you. Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage, make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on a leash, leading the way. \n[32]Nonsense! You can eat ice cream, and walk along the Sienne another time. Right now, allow Col Landa to do his job. Everybody saystheir farewells. Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small table in the outside patio area of Maxims. The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was simply a interrogation-technique.     bd. They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; \n[33]Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius. \n[34]I must say, I appreciate the modesty of this auditorium. Your Cinema has real respect, almost church like. Not to say we couldn't spruce the place up a bit. In Versailles there's a crystal chandelier hanging in the banquet hall that is extraordinary. we're going to get it, and hang it from the very middle of auditorium roof. Also I want to go to Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes, and just scatter them about the lobby. \n[35]Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go now, and we'll see you after the show. He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way. The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly, stares at him. Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm. They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; \n[36] ", "Fredrick": "\n[1]May I join you? \n[2]  \n[3]- Merci. \n[4]I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't trying to be a pest. I was simply trying to be friendly. \n[5]Why not? \n[6]I'm more then just a uniform. \n[7]I thought I was just a uniform? \n[8]Most German soldiers are somebodies son. \n[9]Yes. \n[10]No not really, I'm just teasing you. She leans back annoyed. \n[11]Not exactly. \n[12]All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga was the bossiest. \n[13]My mother died. And my father was a loser. My fathers moto; \"If at first you don't succeed, quit\". The day he left, good riddance. My sisters are all I need. It's why I like your cinema. It makes me feel both closer to them, and a little homesick at the same time. \n[14]The Kino Haus. \n[15]Actually, in Germany, cinema attendance is up. \n[16]How often do you fill your house? \n[17]So if you had one big engagement, that would help you out? \n[18]Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't. \n[19]I've shot the most enemy soldiers in world war two...so far. You bet your sweet ass that got her attention. \n[20]I was alone in a bell tower in a walled off city in Russia. It was myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo, in a bird's nest, against three hundred Soviet soldiers. \n[21]A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a three hundred and sixty degree view. Very advantageous for marksmen. \n[22]Sixty-eight.  The first day. A hundred and fifty the second day. Thirty-two, the third day. On the forth day, they exited the city. Naturally my war story received alot of attention in Germany, that's why they all recognize me. They call me the German Sgt.York. \n[23]Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought. So he did. It's called \"Nation's Pride\", and guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I did. They have posters for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's another reason for all the attention. \n[24]I know, comical, huh? \n[25]Hardly. I've been doing publicity, having my picture taken with different German luminaries, visiting troops, that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris, so I've been helping them in the planning. Joseph is very keen on this film. He's telling anybody who will listen, when \"Nation's Pride\" is released, I'll be the German Van Johnson. Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch. However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as \"Joseph\", like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side of things. This young man is trouble with a capital \"T\", and she needs to stay far fucking away from him. She abruptly rises, and says; \n[26]Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or not you'd except my invitation.     \n[27]Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is somebody I want you to meet. Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth. The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister formally. \n[28]Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you to the minister of propaganda, the leader of the entire German film industry, and now I'm a actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels. Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to shake. She does. \n[29]And normally, this is beer Goebbels French interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino. \n[30]And you've met the Major. The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German; \n[31]- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet. \n[32]I wanted to inform her. \n[33]But beer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive. Your not trying to fill the house, their fightin g for seats.     61. \n[34]  \n[35]Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic. He chuckles, but alone. \n[36]Why don't you screen \"Lucky Kids\"? I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it. And it's so funny, I've been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That's a great idea, let's watch \"Lucky Kids\" tonight. \n[37]Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of the SS., he'll be running security for the premier. \n[38]What sort of discussion? \n[39]Nothing could be further from the truth Colonel. Your authority is beyond question. But your reputation does proceed you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux or myself be concerned? \n[40]I was just hoping to escort Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her cinema. \n[41]Truly enjoying himself. \n[42]along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face , and says in German; \n[43]Are you the manager, of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks. He laughs. \n[44]I came to visit you. \n[45]Then allow me to lend a assist. \n[46]Normally, you would be.right. And for all the other films I do, I intend to endure evenings like tonight, in the proper sprit. However the fact remains, this film, is based on my military exploits. And in this case, my exploits consisted of me killing many men. Consequently, the part of the film that's playing now,... .I don't like watching this part. \n[47]- So, I thought, I'd come up here and do what I do best, annoy you. And from the look on your face, it would appear I haven't lost my touch. \n[48]Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring the way. \n[49]Let me do it? \n[50]Oh please, it's been two years since i've done a reel change. \n[51] Come on, it's my premiere. \n[52]Well, it's nice to know you can feel something. Even if it's just physical pain. Fredrick steps forward... Shosanna steps backwards... \n[53]I'm not a man you say, \"Go away\" to. There's over three hundred dead bodies in Russia, that if they could, would testify to that. After what I've done for you, you disrespect me at your peril.     156. \n[54]Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the door. \n[55]What the hell was that? While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back... ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to the floor... Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into the audience... The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard. Her eyes go from the audience... .up to the big screen... .Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP. The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's heart... .She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood flowing from the holes she put in his back... .His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN... .DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still \n[56] ", "Zoller": "\n[1]Truly enjoying himself. \n[2]Who wants to send a message to Germany?
