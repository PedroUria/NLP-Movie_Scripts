You awak e? \n[198]I ' m sorry I missed your party. \n[199]I ' m not the kind of guy that breaks his promises. \n[200]I'm sure that's only part of what Mom said. \n[201]W ha t' d s he sa y-- sh e w an ts a divorce? That's just her way of blowing off steam. \n[202]Nothing's gonna happen to me, Terry. Nothing's gonna happen to us -- I won't le t it. Okay ? \n[203]I ' m doing the right thing. I know i t's a sac rifice. It 's the same thing I always tell you kids -- do your best, work hard, never quit. That's how I live my life. I just had no way of knowing it would go this far. \n[204]You're getting grown-up now. I want you to understand. \n[205]You have a father, Terry. \n[206]Maybe I'm not there for the good times, but I'm there if you need me. \n[207]It's just another six months. \n[208]Come here. Give me a hug. \n[209]Okay. I called this family meeting because there's something we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow what I'm doing involves a lot of sacrifice from everyone, but this is something patriotic for the country that you can all be proud of. I called the meeting because we're gonna have to move. \n[210]This isn't a democracy, Terry. This is a dictatorsh ip. And that's my decision. It's getting too dangerous. \n[211]There's too many people here who know us. \n[212]We're moving to Minnesota and changing our name to 'Anderson'. That's the deal. It's done. \n[213]That language is unacceptable, y oung lady . You sit down. \n[214]Where are you going? Don't you want to discuss this? \n[215]You'll make new friends. \n[216]Minnesota's great. Lakes and everything. We can get a nice piece of land there. Maybe we can even get a horse. \n[217]What's this? \n[218]Sonny Red and all them big puffers. \n[219]Hey, Left. \n[220]He can stick Jersey up his ass. \n[221]Once Lefty arranged it with Trafficante-- \n[222]Simple arithmetic. \n[223]Some young guy. \n[224]You just gotta take it with a grain of salt. \n[225]Fuggedaboudit. Be a made guy? That would be unbelievable. \n[226]as he calculates the advantages and dangers of his new offer... \n[227]I just got some things I gotta take care of, back in the city. \n[228]How long's he gonna stay down there? \n[229]Nobody calls me cocksucker. Understood? \n[230]I'm not getting it. \n[231]\n[232]No fucking way, Left. \n[233]That's got nothing to do with it. \n[234]I got no fucking loyalty to Sonny Black. That ain't the issue. \n[235]Nobody calls me cocksucker. \n[236]You're the fucking cocksucker. H uh? Yo u f uck ing coc ksu cke r--h ow does it feel?. \n[237]Go ahead, Left. Fucking whack m e .

You make me so fucking mad I'm gonna whack you and then I'm gonna get whacked for whacking you anyway! \n[239]I ain't picking up the bag. \n[240]I ain't. \n[241]with the Nagra in it. The Maitre d' waits for Donnie's shoes, GESTURES...Donnie thinking fast... \n[242]Get a load of this guy. (to Maitre d') How about you take off your fucking pants? \n[243]I'm not taking my shoes off for this guy. \n[244]Hey, Boobie, who won the fucking war?                                  : \n[245]I ain't doing it. \n[246]I grew up an orphan because my Dad took a fucking bullet in Okinawa, and I'll lose my boot up his fucking asshole before I'll           ' take orders from fucking Mr. Moto here. \n[247]GRABS the Maitre d' and RAMS him through the doors of the MEN'S   ROOM. \n[248]On yo ur ma rk s. Ge t s et . Go! \n[249]into the darkness...Sees them DISAPPEAR into the trees. \n[250]Adrenaline rushes through him. As 'he turns, and turns, and WAITS... For the bullet that will kill him... \n[251]Jogs a couple of steps to find some cover... Then hears \n[252]Boobie falls heavily... BLOOD belches out of his mouth... \n[253]Sonny found out about it? \n[254]How'd he find out? \n[255]Sonny. \n[256]I don't know, Left. Boobie was a friend, of all of us. \n[257]What are you talking about? \n[258]You told Sonny that Boobie was holding out? \n[259]Because of me? What was Boobie saying? \n[260]Donnie holds the Nagra in his hand. The SOUNDS of the murder as it plays. . . . \n[261]the pile of TRASH in the well of the car--McDonald's wrappers, Tampax wrappers, a copy of Mademoiselle, a lipstick, a basketball.. DUMPS it. Pulls out the ASHTRAY. Something that makes him suspicious... \n[262]between his fingers. RECOGNITION. . .He DIGS into the space between the se ats. Fin ds a quart er. A pape r clip.

Our daughter Terry is a drug user. \n[266]Oversleeping. Short attention span. Hostility to authority. B in g e e at i n g-- \n[267]Don't tell me my business. Do you know what this is? \n[268]This is a marijuana seed. \n[269]Maggie, I am an FBI agent. That's who I am. I am out there risking my life, 18, 20 hours a day, weekends, Christmas-- \n[270]Well, what do you think     I ' m doing it for? I am spending      my life to put away the guys that     make money off this shit, and I'm      damned to hell if I ' m gonna have    it in my house. \n[271]Don't change the subject. \n[272]I'm not the fucking pothead. \n[273]Geddadaheah. Go weigh yourself or something. Sleeping Beauty and I are going out to the woodshed. \n[274]In the fucking car that I make the payments on, in the fucking driveway of the house that I pay the fucking mortgage on--a goddam m ar i ju an a s e ed -- \n[275]I'm looking for my wife.

I ' m her husband1 Who the fuck else would I be? \n[281]Can't I see her? \n[282]Look, Mom's gonna be okay. \n[283]I know how you're feeling. But i t ' s j u s t-- \n[284]Maybe just a few more weeks. \n[285]The doctor says you    're    gonna be okay. We j ust have     to    get you into rehabilitation     as    soon as we can. You'll be as      goo   d as new before you know it. \n[286]Maggie, listen to me, Maggie, because this is what it is. The minute I come out from under all these guys I ' m with, they will all be killed--because of me. Because they trusted me. I gotta go back. \n[287]I have a chance here to become a in th e Mafia. I t's gonna happen the en d of the year. And then I'll come out. Then it'll all be rest of your life. \n[288]Look, I think that sitdown's tonight. I can't find Lefty. \n[289]Only made guys can go to a s itdown. \n[290]I don't know. Listen to me--I ' m worried. \n[291]Carrying his mail, Donnie enters a DARK room. MOONLIGHT filters through the blinds. He closes the door.

And the whole time I was a fucking rat. You're right. \n[311]You'd have to be the biggest fucking mutt in the history of the Mafia. \n[312]as Bruno emerges from the boat. Lights a cigarette. Looks around, \n[313]Shit. He's up again. \n[314]You ask me it's the funniest fucking thing in the world. Those fucking agents could scam Senators and Congressmen and meanwhile we had a party on their boat and they didn't get a fucking thing on us. Sonny'11 laugh his ass off. \n[315]We outsmarted the agents. We got a higher Z .Q. than the fuckin g Congressmen. \n[316]What black marks? \n[317]Are we gonna whack this fucking guy or not? \n[318]That's right, Left--you're my best friend. \n[319]What do you mean, it's over? \n[320]What the fuck--?

He won't spend a dollar to take a lady out. \n[181]I'm telling you, it's good to be back in New York. That fucking Florida baked everybody's brain. when Sonny gets out of the fucking sun he's gonna realize what a miserable fucking idea you had. \n[182]Do I know?

Joe, you're scaring me. \n[82]That would apply to every teenager in America. \n[83]Where did you find that? \n[84]You don't have to tell me, Joe. \n[85]You know, Jules called me this wee k.
