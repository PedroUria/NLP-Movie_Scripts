Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4. \n[3] \n[4]That's up to you field guys.

Make a note of that. \n[18] \n[19]They'll serve as a labor force.  You can use them for physical stuff... loading, unloading, repairs, power lines, that kind of thing. Even cleaning...sweeping...,uh, tidying up. \n[20]Of course, age is a factor, but the real factor is the training program, especially the psychological.  The mind controls the body after all, and we're doing wonderful things with the mind. \n[21]Tired? \n[22] \n[23]  \n[24]Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.

I guarantee it. \n[34]Sorry to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on Christmas Eve, but I'm off to the Caribbean in a few hours, and I wanted to make sure you'd got the transmission on the security sweep. \n[35] \n[36]  \n[37]Well, no one's out there, but officially these are \"hostile zones.\"  Therefore you'd be within your rights to classify anyone as \"hostile,\" I think. But I repeat, you should be worried about boredom, not action.  Any other questions before I go? \n[38] \n[39]You can't be serious!  This is some kind of a joke...in poor taste. \n[40]Abort?  You want to lose twenty top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission?  Do you know what that would look like on my record? Or yours?

Literally. \n[33]The Crawlers are low enough and heavy enough, they won't blow.  The men should wear armored vests and carry double weapons and ammo for the weight.

Did they ask for assistance? \n[36]Like my daddy used to say, \"Nothing's ever as simple as it's supposed to be...except shit.\" \n[37]Good point. \n[38]There's resistance? \n[39]Humph.

Who are we fighting here! \n[42] \n[43] \n[44] \n[45] \n[46]It may not be heroic, and we may waste some ammo, but by God we'll get the job done. \n[47]Whaaaaat? \n[48]What about Number One?  Try Number... \n[49]You should have waked me sooner! This is bad, very bad.  I never should have let that clown Mekum test his wonder boy army on me.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Shit!  We don't even know what we're up against.  How many...? \n[50]We're sitting ducks here!  There could be a couple of divisions! More!  We don't even have the weapons to arm the old soldiers. \n[51]Not only are we apparently out twenty of your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we're out both crawlers and all the weapons...so we can't arm the old soldiers, the ones you \"improved\" on, to defend ourselves... \n[52] \n[53] \n[54]Meaning? \n[55]Doesn't matter.

That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded. \n[14]Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.
