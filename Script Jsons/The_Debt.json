Once we're in West Berlin there'll be transport to Templehof airbase and a private charter. \n[22] \n[23] \n[24]It's my birthday. \n[25]This is it. \n[26] \n[27]And...I want another drink. \n[28]Are you alright? \n[29]It's a brave thing you're doing. \n[30]But you're doing it anyway. Because you know how important it is. \n[31]You're very brave. \n[32]I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need to meet us at the hospital. \n[33]Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations. \n[34] \n[35]Not without her. \n[36]It's not over. \n[37]\n[38]It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks... maybe three. \n[39]We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone. \n[40]We can do this. We just need to stay focussed. \n[41] \n[42]What happened? What's the matter? \n[43]What? \n[44]It's alright. It's alright.

We're taking him back. \n[55]What are you doing? \n[56] \n[57] \n[58]Don't do that again. \n[59]We're not animals. Just remember what we are. Remember what we're not. \n[60]What are you doing? \n[61] \n[62]She wants to go out. \n[63] \n[64]What does a monster like you know about suffering? \n[65]A doctor.

Only twenty-five. \n[5]Despite their youth they'd had the courage to confront an unimaginable evil.... \n[6]...a man whose sadistic experiments left thousands disfigured or dead, who became known by a name which defiles the annals of medicine: The Surgeon of Birkenau. \n[7]Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin... \n[8]But this was not what was celebrated. It was their youth itself that became a symbol.

Do it for your grandson. \n[15]Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow? \n[16]But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach?

That's very good. \n[8]We're going to David's apartment. \n[9]I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job.  I know he came to see you yesterday. \n[10]A little of both. What did he want? \n[11]What did he tell you? \n[12]My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. \n[13]You're in my room. \n[14]I'm moving in with him. You're at the end there. \n[15]What do you think of your new wife? \n[16]Pretty. \n[17]You didn't notice. \n[18]You know what I've noticed? You don't notice women. I've noticed that. How long have I known you? \n[19]Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me? \n[20]Well, well...I think he just noticed. \n[21]Yes? \n[22]Now an attack from behind. \n[23]Where have you come from? \n[24]Really?

We don't listen to him. He isn't there. He isn't a human being. He... \n[79]We have a date. Ten days time. The Americans are going to help. \n[80]Fuck! \n[81]It's not happening. \n[82]The Americans have pulled out. Has he been fed? \n[83]Did you feed him? \n[84]I said has he...? \n[85] \n[86] \n[87]You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose. \n[88]It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can. \n[89]It's happening. I can feel it. \n[90]Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up!

It's your shift now so you can go back in there... \n[100]Don't be stupid. \n[101]Out. We're going out. \n[102] \n[103]Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at all. \n[104]He might go to the house, might try and get a message to the wife... \n[105]So we what? We...are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that! \n[106] \n[107]No-one's ever going to find him again. \n[108] \n[109]Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again. \n[110]Nobody needs to know what happened here. \n[111]That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau. \n[112]No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is...this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? Who's to say...? \n[113]Maybe that's a worse fate. Maybe that's...The important thing is justice... justice is seen to be done! \n[114] \n[115] \n[116] \n[117]Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say it. \n[118]We don't know it's him. \n[119]If you read it... \n[120]This is a little internet story.

Yet. \n[121]David comes back after all this time, I want to know why. I had his apartment searched. This was on his computer... \n[122]He didn't say anything to you last night..? \n[123]Rachel..? \n[124]Because he couldn't handle it. I told him we had to deal with it and he couldn't handle it. He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked... \n[125] \n[126] \n[127]There's a journalist. \n[128]A Ukrainian. He's heard about it and he's going to interview Vogel.  Then it all comes apart.  We don't have the name of the hospital. You have to find out where he is. \n[129]David's taken himself out of the equation. I can't do it. You're the only one left. \n[130]We can't... \n[131] \n[132] \n[133]I wasn't referring to the wheelchair. \n[134]If I could go back, Rachel, I'd change it all. If I could give you back a chance to be happy, to be... \n[135]But there's one thing I would never change. \n[136]My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport. \n[137]Go down to her.

This is wonderful. This is...and you're okay? Rachel? You're alright, yes? \n[151]Rachel? \n[152]Well, thank God I was, but... \n[153]  \n[154]About David? \n[155]What? \n[156] \n[157]Truth is a luxury, Rachel. Some people have to put other things first - their country, their people...their children... \n[158]Sarah's so proud of you, Rachel. You have to think about her. \n[159] \n[160] \n[161]Rachel...?

It's an old man in a hospital! You said - nobody will believe it! No-one will notice! \n[147]What are you talking about? \n[148]Are you insane? \n[149]I'm not...Look at me! I'm not capable of...This is insane. I can't do this. \n[150]I won't do this. \n[151] \n[152] \n[153]God doesn't plant car bombs. \n[154] \n[155]She can never find out. \n[156]How can I?  How can I? \n[157](turning to the Kiosk \n[158]Just a coffee. \n[159]At that moment, I don't think I was thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother. I was thinking about how she had suffered in Europe. \n[160]  \n[161]Go to bed, Sarah. \n[162]My own party and you're the only                    * friend I have...                                    * \n[163]... all Stephen's friends.                          * Stephen's girlfriends. \n[164]And what kind of a friend are                       * you?

He's the right age. \n[181]Tomorrow. \n[182]I'll tell you something. At that moment, when I was on the floor, I wasn't thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother. And what she had suffered in Europe. I think that was what gave me the strength to get up again. \n[183]Does Stephan know you're here?                            * \n[184]* \n[185]Things became...very bad between                 * us.

I've heard of you. \n[209] \n[210]It isn't him. It's over. \n[211]You were wrong. \n[212]About David. You were wrong about him. \n[213]He didn't kill himself because he was afraid the story would come out. \n[214] \n[215]When he came to see me, he was asking me for something. \n[216]My permission. And I didn't give it. I wouldn't let him tell the truth and he was tired of living with the lie. \n[217]  \n[218] \n[219]I want to do something to make her proud of me. \n[220]People have to know the truth, Stephan.

She reaches an opening on her left, which reveals a STAIRCASE winding around a central lift shaft, caged in frosted glass panels. She glances through it as she passes. And just for a second we see an ELDERLY MAN walking down the stairs.
