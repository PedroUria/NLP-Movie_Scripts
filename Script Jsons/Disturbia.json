I'm just gonna plug it back -- \n[44]What are you, mental? \n[45]Yes! \n[46]    \n[47]  \n[48]  \n[49] \n[50]Give me some details, what's happening out there? \n[51]Wait, Ronnie -- Hello? \n[52]  \n[53]  \n[54]\n[55]I'm coming!! \n[56]  \n[57]Oh shit!

That's what I'm talking about! \n[67]It's cool, I'm all green. \n[68]  \n[69] \n[70]  \n[71]   \n[72]  \n[73]Hey doggie, come here... \n[74] \n[75]  \n[76]  \n[77]  \n[78]The world right outside the window. \n[79]  \n[80]...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie... \n[81] \n[82]Four o'clock every Thursday, she goes to the country club to play tennis with Betty Big-Bangs there. \n[83]And... ladies disappear... cue white Mercedes... Mr. Pilch... arriving from the office... \n[84] \n[85]He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math. \n[86]Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject. \n[87]Now tilt your gaze up... \n[88]WINDOW - Lonnie vacuums as Mr. Pilch enters the room behind him. Mr. Pilch flips off the light switch, cutting the power to the vacuum. Lonnie startles, turns around, sees Pilch standing there with the flowers and a big smile. A beat, then -- Lonnie jumps in Pilch's arms, kissing him passionately. \n[89]C'mon, there's more. \n[90]No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom. \n[91]  \n[92] \n[93]He's lived there a couple of years, but I've never noticed he mows his lawn every two days. \n[94]Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up. \n[95]Last stop on the tour. \n[96]Don't know. \n[97]      \n[98]Nope, no I'm fine. \n[99]Thanks, that was really humiliating. \n[100]Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way. \n[101]Hey, so -- how'd the move go? \n[102]I'd help, but... I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment. \n[103]  \n[104]That doesn't sound good. \n[105]Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger. Nice talking to you. \n[106]I know the tone. \n[107]Noticed that, too. \n[108] \n[109]What are you stopping for? \n[110] \n[111]Whoa. \n[112]    \n[113] \n[114]Holy shit.   A dent -- \n[115]Jesus, mom!                       Christ, Kale! \n[116]What?   No, I -- \n[117]Nothing, just watching the wind blow. \n[118]No, see for yourself. \n[119](now flipping through \n[120]Movement. \n[121]Better late than never. \n[122] \n[123]Jackass! \n[124]Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that. \n[125] \n[126]Seriously? \n[127] \n[128]No.                                  No. \n[129]It's not gonna be her. \n[130]I have to. \n[131]It's her. \n[132]She totally saw us -- \n[133] \n[134]Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs -- \n[135] \n[136]Do you need to call anyone? \n[137]Uh, sure, come on in -- \n[138]That's Ronnie. \n[139]Excuse me... \n[140]  \n[141]It's a little messy. \n[142]So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? \n[143]He drives a car like the one she was seen in. \n[144]60's era Mustang. \n[145]They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender. \n[146]Hey -- \n[147]Yeah -- \n[148] \n[149]How'd he fix it so fast -- \n[150]  \n[151](off Ashley's \n[152] \n[153]About two or three years. \n[154]Not that I've seen -- \n[155]   \n[156] \n[157]How'd you get my phone? \n[158]What'd you do? \n[159]What the hell? \n[160]Where's -- \n[161]So that's why the grass is greener... \n[162]So why the move? \n[163]No, seriously. \n[164]What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape? \n[165]That's him. \n[166]No. \n[167]How do you know? \n[168]  \n[169]He's going in. \n[170]What do you think they're listening to? \n[171]And she's down for the count. \n[172]  \n[173]Looks like. \n[174]What were you expecting? \n[175]Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me to. \n[176]\"Fine?\" \n[177]\"Fine\" like your first cousin \"fine\" or \"fine\" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way? \n[178]I can't hear -- \n[179] \n[180] \n[181]Are you nuts?! \n[182]Mom? \n[183]  \n[184]Dammit. \n[185]Shit! \n[186]  \n[187]Dumbass dumbass -- \n[188]Okay, so where is she -- \n[189]Oh shit oh shit... \n[190] \n[191]Giles totally busted me. \n[192]They were arguing -- \n[193]Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her -- \n[194]And then -- nothing. \n[195]Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too? \n[196]Wait -- \n[197]A door just slammed. \n[198]Asshole, I'm serious. \n[199]Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall -- \n[200]Goddamn you!! \n[201]No, don't! \n[202]Ronnie -- just Ronnie. \n[203]I heard the door -- \n[204]Fine.   Good.     Okay -- \n[205]Anything caffeinated. \n[206]   \n[207]  \n[208]I know, how did you -- \n[209]Dad put those security bolts on -- \n[210] \n[211]Yeah, I do. \n[212]That's right. \n[213]I think I'd like to hear his opinion. \n[214]I popped my Spanish teacher. \n[215]I like your shirt, by the way.    I mean, the color. \n[216]Oh, the... that dark orange.   Always reminds me of Texas. \n[217]Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas -- \n[218]Huh. \n[219]Just a black eye. \n[220]  \n[221]I know, he's a total freak, right? \n[222]Are you messing with me? \n[223]So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- \n[224]The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- \n[225]Maybe. \n[226] \n[227]Well what if she's really \"not moving?\" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- \n[228]You're leaving? \n[229]Whose? \n[230]How is that possible? \n[231]Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- \n[232]Oh my god, \"Skinny Psycho?!\" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish -- \n[233]And now the whole neighborhood's coming. \n[234]Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain. \n[235] \n[236]It's funny, though. \n[237]I didn't peg you as a conformist. \n[238]  \n[239]Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business... \n[240]You think I'm buying that? \n[241]I'm not biting -- \n[242]That's it. \n[243]Hey! \n[244]     \n[245]Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life. \n[246]Okay -- okay -- \n[247]What are you doing? \n[248]Coulda fooled me. \n[249]Forget -- \n[250]You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me. \n[251]It's not a cover -- \n[252]What else have I seen? \n[253]Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it. \n[254]But I've also seen those designer window shades of yours, and guess what? They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner. \n[255]      \n[256]Hey. \n[257]If would have gone to the flower shop, but -- \n[258]Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take. \n[259]You know the other night... when you said you thought I'd be more messed up... \n[260]I didn't kill my -- \n[261]Three-thirty. \n[262]You better see this. \n[263]Look, quick -- \n[264] \n[265]   \n[266]Phase one, steal his code from his opener. \n[267]There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. \"On\" or \"off.\" \n[268]No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag -- \n[269] \n[270]Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time... \n[271]   \n[272] \n[273]Let me conference Ashley in. Ashley, you there? \n[274]Nice. \n[275]Okay, Ron -- Green light. \n[276]You're all good. \n[277]You okay -- \n[278]Dude, glove compartment, other side. \n[279]Well, while you're there, will you just check? \n[280]You see the package? \n[281]Whenever you're ready. \n[282]Just start over. \n[283]No, no -- \n[284]Ronnie, he's coming around. \n[285](trying to remain \n[286]\n[287]Put the remote back -- \n[288]Easy on the door. \n[289]Don't panic, he's coming straight for you -- \n[290]Back seat, NOW! \n[291]Ashley -- \n[292]Shut up, stay down and don't move. \n[293]Ronnie, you're good -- \n[294]Ronnie? \n[295]Ronnie, was that the whole code? Ronnie? \n[296](talking to Ashley \n[297]Was that the whole code? \n[298] \n[299] \n[300]Getting her license number -- \n[301]\"Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me.\" That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people -- \n[302]  \n[303] \n[304]Trying to get to the bottom of this. \n[305]What's it look like? \n[306]Not who I think. \n[307]What, crazy?     Maybe I am.   But maybe I'm right. \n[308]Are you two gonna help me or not? \n[309] \n[310] \n[311]So what's your deal? You hanging out or not? \n[312]Sure. \n[313]     \n[314]Get off me, man. \n[315] \n[316]  \n[317](into walkie talkie \n[318]Got video, no audio. \n[319]Light on, far end. \n[320] \n[321]Stay calm, it's there. \n[322]You're still clear, check the bag. \n[323]Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents -- \n[324]The camera's sliding -- \n[325]Ronnie? \n[326]Ronnie?! \n[327]He's in the house -- Ronnie? \n[328]What the hell -- \n[329]RONNIE!    Shit -- \n[330]    \n[331]Ronnie?! \n[332]Ronnie, can you hear me?! Giles, open the door!! \n[333]Hey! \n[334]Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him -- \n[335]It was already open. \n[336]You're a lying son of a bitch! \n[337]He's in there, goddammit!   He's inside! He's lying! \n[338]Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this -- That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago -- \n[339]So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood -- \n[340] \n[341]Mom -- \n[342]It was -- \n[343]Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me -- \n[344]     \n[345]\n[346]Shit -- \n[347]Ronnie -- \n[348]How -- How long have you been here? \n[349]Still, you could have -- \n[350] \n[351]Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right? \n[352]What if he wasn't always a guy? \n[353] \n[354]I was watching, remember? \n[355]   \n[356]So that's when the garage door started closing. \n[357]That's great. \n[358]Yeah, I lost signal -- \n[359] \n[360]You're not fooling me, Giles... \n[361]    \n[362] \n[363] \n[364]Ronnie?! \n[365]Ronnie -- MOM!! \n[366]  \n[367]  \n[368]    \n[369]It's dead. \n[370]  \n[371]No, I've gotta get her -- \n[372](beat; then; an idea \n[373]Once I have his attention, you go get her. \n[374] \n[375]  \n[376]Ashley!   Are you okay? \n[377]Stick to the plan -- \n[378]   \n[379]That was a warning! \n[380]\n[381]Where's my mom? \n[382]I don't know -- the cops should be here any sec -- \n[383]No flashing lights -- stay here -- \n[384]Parker, where's the cavalry?! \n[385]Parker, you need to get them here right now -- Giles is -- \n[386]\n[387] \n[388]him, I was so -- he's the one who left, he's the one who gave up, you know? -- But that's b.s. See, the truth is, my dad -- He saved me. \n[389]  \n[390]Movement. \n[391]She's whacked. Plain and simple. I think she thought it'd be some sick challenge or something -- hey, commission's the same I guess... \n[392]No way.   She can't be serious. \n[393] \n[394] ", "Mrs.": "", "Carlson": "", "Detective": "", "Parker": "\n[1]  \n[2]a sixty-foot radius from this guy here. \n[3]He's like a modem.

So don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. It won't work, and you'll look stupid. Now, I'll be checking up on you a lot. Here's my card -- You're set up to pay his incarceration fee, Ms. Brecht? \n[6]  \n[7] \n[8]Kale, first times happen. The officers knew that.

I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago. \n[9]Still going. \n[10]Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on -- \n[11]I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and now... Forcefully relocated. \n[12]I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal. \n[13] \n[14] \n[15] \n[16]What took you so long? The house isn't that big. \n[17]Oh.   -- Locked out. \n[18]Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind. \n[19]May I? \n[20]Nice to meet you. Video games, huh? I like to play. \n[21]A little? \n[22]Anything interesting out there? \n[23]Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale? \n[24]Is that so. \n[25]Yeah, I've seen him.   So? \n[26](realizing; then \n[27]Gee, that really narrows it down. \n[28] \n[29]So that's the infamous black mustang, huh? \n[30]The one with no dent? \n[31]Because it was never there in the first place? \n[32]Sorry guys, no bashed-in fender, just a Longhorns bumper sticker. \n[33]Okay, fine, stakeout. Who's on my shift? \n[34]Do you know how long Giles has lived there? \n[35]So he could've lived in Texas... Hey, check this out. \n[36]The summary lists four main criteria. Our guy meets at least three. White male between the age of twenty-five and fifty. He doesn't have any pets, right? \n[37]You said he lives alone -- \n[38] \n[39] \n[40] \n[41]I'm crafty like that. \n[42]Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear. \n[43] \n[44]Only in disturbia... \n[45]What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures... \n[46]Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life... had its temptations... But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever. \n[47]Something like that. So... what're your issues, Kale? \n[48]Another car -- \n[49]You seen her before? \n[50] \n[51]Who said chivalry's dead? \n[52]There's a club girl for you. \n[53]Bright green bracelet's \"The Pyramids,\" purple's \"Club 360,\" the big black stamp's from \"Flavor.\" \n[54] \n[55]Denied... \n[56](been there, done \n[57]Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance. \n[58]Could be radio.

Did you even notice my hair? \n[74]With the non dent dent -- \n[75]Why, because he slashed your mom's tire? \n[76]It's called \"the day after,\" Kale.

So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it. \n[84]Kale, you're welcome to come, but -- \n[85] \n[86] \n[87]Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya? \n[88]  \n[89](peering out the window \n[90]Back off or I'll throw it where you can't follow. \n[91]Even better. \n[92]What are you doing? \n[93]I'm trying to enjoy my party. Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform -- \n[94]What does that mean? \n[95]No, I'm not gonna forget it. \n[96] \n[97]And the whole \"my-neighbor's-the- killer\" thing. Great cover -- \n[98]So what is it, Kale?   Huh?   What else have you seen? \n[99]Yeah.
