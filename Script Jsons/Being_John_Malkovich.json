A few other short men sit reading tiny magazines. \tCraig approaches Floris, the receptionist.  \n[2] \tCraig enters. Lester, a giant of an old man, sits hunched \tbehind his tiny desk.  \n[3]\t\t    Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, \t\t    well, you know.  \n[4]\t\t    Security.  \n[5]\t\t    She's not my secretary. She's what \t\t    they call an executive liaison, and \t\t    I'm not banging her, if that's what \t\t    you\u0092re implying.  \n[6]\t\t    Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you \t\t    feel you can bring to LesterCorp?  \n[7]\t\t\t \t\t    You think so, eh? Which comes first, \t\t    L or... Glooph?\t  \n[8]\t\t    Damn, you are good. I tried to trick \t\t    you. Okay, put these in order.  \tLester hands Craig a bunch of index cards. Craig orders \tthem with amazing speed and dexterity. Lester watches, \teyes wide.  \n[9]\t\t\t \t\t    Floris, get Guinness on the phone.  \n[10]\t\t    Forget it.  \n[11]\t\t\t \t\t    Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how \t\t    she puts up with this damn speech \t\t    impediment of mine.  \n[12]\t\t    Flattery will get you everywhere, \t\t    my boy. But I'm afraid I have to \t\t    trust Floris on this one. You see, \t\t    she has her doctorate in speech \t\t    impedimentology from Case Western. \t\t    Perhaps you've read her memoirs, \t\t    \"I can't understand a word any of \t\t    you are saying.\"  \n[13]\t\t    Pity, it tells it like it is. \t\t    That's why the eastern, read Jewish, \t\t    publishing establishment won't touch \t\t    it. That's a quote from the book \t\t    jacket. George Will, I think. \t\t\t \t\t    I apologize if you can't understan \t\t    a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.  \n[14]\t\t\t \t\t    Thank you for being kind enough to \t\t    lie. You see, I've been very lonely \t\t    in my isolated tower of \t\t    indecipherable speech. You're hired. \t\t    Any questions?  \n[15]\t\t    Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the \t\t    savings on to you. \t\t\t \t\t    But seriously, that's all covered in \t\t    orientation.  \n[16] \tCraig in a cream colored suit, pours over the file cabinets. \tFloris watches from the doorway.  \n[17]\t\t    Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. \t\t    Why, if I were eighty years younger, \t\t    I'd box your ears.  \n[18]\t\t    One hundred and five. Carrot juice. \t\t\t \t\t    Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost \t\t    not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, \t\t    and I, have to piss sitting down... \t\t    like a godamn girly... every fifteen \t\t    minutes. But nobody wants to die, \t\t    Schwartz.  \n[19]\t\t    No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what \t\t    I do is get older, wrinkled like a \t\t    former plum that's become the \t\t    wrinkled prune you see before you. \t\t    Oh, to be a young man again, maybe \t\t    then Floris would care for me.  \n[20]\t\t    I don't want to be your godamn link, \t\t    damn you. I want to feel Floris' \t\t    naked thighs against my own. I want \t\t    to know passion. I want my body to \t\t    inspire lust in that beautiful, \t\t    complex woman. I want her to shiver \t\t    in a spasm of ecstasy when I \t\t    penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony \t\t    of the flesh, Schwartz.  \n[21]\t\t    All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice \t\t    Juice Bar after work today and I'll \t\t    spill my goddamn guts for you.  \tLester exits.  \n[22]\t\t    Imagine a room full of women. \t\t    Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, \t\t    Schwartz. A harem, if you will. \t\t    Me in leather. A harness, if you \t\t    like. I am the object of this \t\t    desire, and all eyes are on me as \t\t    I speak. \u0093Ladies,\u0094 I begin. \u0093I am \t\t    the love god, Eros. I intoxicate \t\t    you. My spunk is to you manna from \t\t    heaven...  \n[23]\t\t    Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, \t\t    Craig.  \n[24]\t\t    Shall we say dinner on Friday. \t\t    Just the two of us? \t\t\t \t\t    You can come too if you like, \t\t    Schwartz.  \n[25] \tLester sits at his desk studying an instruction manual for a \tjuicer. The spanking new juicer sits on his desk. There is an \turgent knocking at the door.  \n[26]\t\t    Yes?  \tCraig rushes in.  \n[27]\t\t    Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted \t\t    to see. \t\t\t \t\t    Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your \t\t    fingers clear of the blade, and \t\t    never, never use it while bathing in \t\t    a tub full of water.  \n[28]\t\t    Ah. yes, the little door. \t\t\t \t\t    There is a short film on the little \t\t    door in the orientation room in \t\t    exactly two minutes. If you hurry, \t\t    you'll just make it.  \n[29]\t\t    Put up reel 752.  \n[30] \tIt's a posh place with flocked wallpaper and candelabras. \tLester, Craig, and Lotte sit around an elegantly appointed \ttable with all different sorts of juices in front of them. \tLotte is still wet. Lester sits quite close to her.  \n[31]\t\t    Tell me, Lotte, can you understand \t\t    a word I'm saying?  \n[32]\t\t    Oh, be still my heart.  \n[33]\t\t    With immense pleasure, my dear. Down \t\t    that hall, ninth door on the left. \t\t    Watch the step down. It's sunken, \t\t    you know.  \tLotte smiles, and heads down the hall.  \n[34]\t\t    More beet-spinach juice, my friend?  \n[35]\t\t    I see. Are you unhappy at our little \t\t    company?  \n[36]\t\t    And what sort of business will this \t\t    be? If you don't mind my asking.  \n[37]\t\t    The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. \t\t    Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, \t\t    there are certain \u0093doors\u0094 which \t\t    should never be opened.  \n[38] \tLotte walks down the ritzy hallway. She is counting closed \tdoors in search of the bathroom. She opens a door, looks \tinside, gasps, then enters the room.  \n[39] \tLotte enters the room. It is dark. At the far end there \tis what amounts to a candle-lit shrine to John Malkovich. \tThe centerpiece of the shrine is an enormous photograph \tof Malkovich bordered by a garland of flowers. Lotte stares \tat it for a moment, then drops to her knees in front of it.  \n[40]\t\t    You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. \t\t\t \t\t    Ma'am  \n[41]\t\t    There are rules, boy, procedures, \t\t    etiquette. This is not a toy. I've \t\t    been waiting seventy years to utilize \t\t    this room, grooming myself, quietly \t\t    setting the stage, performing \t\t    ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all \t\t    his motion pictures again and again. \t\t    Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping \t\t    properly.  \n[42]\t\t    I am not alone. There are others. We \t\t    are legion. You will pay for this \t\t    blasphemy. You will pay dearly.  \tLester exits. Craig looks at Maxine. There is a moment \tof tension. Finally:  \n[43] \tMany cloaked people in the room kneeling with candles in \thand before the lit photo of Malkovich. Lotte kneels in the \tback row. They chant:  \n[44] \tThe worshippers mill about, chatting, drinking coffee, \tnibbling on cookies.  \n[45]\t\t    May I have your attention, please. \t\t    We have a new disciple among us tonight.  \n[46]\t\t    She is the wife of Schwartz.  \tA stunned hush falls over the group.  \n[47]\t\t    No you mustn't, my child.  \n[48]\t\t    We need you on the inside, my child. \t\t    To report on his comings and goings, \t\t    and if need be, to... destroy him... \t\t\t \t\t    ...for lack of a better word.  \n[49] \tLester sits at his desk. The intercom buzzes.  \n[50]\t\t\t \t\t    Yes, my dear?  \n[51]\t\t    Thank you, Floris.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\t    Good morning, Lotte!  \n[53]\t\t    You followed your heart, my child, \t\t    and that is not necessarily a bad \t\t    thing.  \n[54]\t\t\t \t\t    My child, I don't think its a great \t\t    mystery what Craig's up to.  \n[55] \tLester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi \tdesk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and \thollow-eyed.  \n[56]\t\t    You know I think it pays to leave \t\t    juice-making to the trained \t\t    professionals. You look terrible, \t\t    my dear.  \n[57]\t\t    Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must \t\t    inform you that I find that highly \t\t    arousing.  \n[58]\t\t\t \t\t    What?! That is not allowed. My God, \t\t    you are supposed to be one of us. \t\t    You know you must never partake of \t\t    Malkovich by yourself!  \n[59]\t\t    Oh, didn't anyone show you the \t\t    indoctrination video?  \n[60]\t\t    Oh, sorry. Right this way.  \n[61]\t\t    Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians. \t\t    As you may already know, today a \t\t    baby was born into this sad world.  \tWe see a shot of a newborn.  \n[62]\t\t    His name is John Horatio Hannibal \t\t    Malkovich. And we are the keepers \t\t    of the door to his soul. One day, \t\t    when his brain is big enough, we \t\t    will all journey into his head and \t\t    live there for all eternity. Following \t\t    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx, \t\t    we will build the ultimate communist \t\t    community, one body and hundreds, \t\t    maybe thousands, of brains inside \t\t    working together to form a super \t\t    human intellect capable of curing \t\t    disease, stopping all war, and \t\t    ruling the world with a benevolent \t\t    fist. We will take a wife, a woman \t\t    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who \t\t    is, as yet, still an infant herself.  \tWe see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in \ther hair.  \n[63]\t\t    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella \t\t    DeMent.  \n[64]\t\t    Well, I tried to explain it to her, \t\t    but...  \tLester points to his ear and shrugs.  \n[65] \tThe worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.  \n[66]\t\t    Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're \t\t    all prepared, and perhaps this \t\t    Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand \t\t    a bit. We will enter the portal \t\t    tonight!  \tEveryone cheers.  \n[67]\t\t    Aaaahhhh, the portal!  \n[68]\t\t    No! Don't harm the vessel!  \n[69]\t\t    I understand, but we must protect \t\t    the vessel at all costs. \t\t\t \t\t    Please, Craig, please step aside \t\t    and allow us to have what is \t\t    rightfully ours.  \n[70]\t\t\t \t\t    Clear the way for them, my friends. \t\t    They will be dealt with in due time.  \tThe Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine \texit.  \n[71]\t\t    Now, let's see what we can do to \t\t    salvage this portal... for the sake \t\t    of all that is good.  \tThe Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and \tbegin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement. \tFingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and \tskin on the rough gray surface.  \n[72]\t\t    Well, let's see what we've got \t\t    here.  \tLester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind \thim.  \n[73]\t\t    My God, where am I? This seems so \t\t    familiar.  \tThe person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.  \n[74]\t\t    My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker! \t\t    Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!  \n[75]\t\t    Oh, I'm just the actor in that \t\t    Twilight Zone episode.  \tThere is a popping sound.  \n[76] \tThe cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting. \tLester enters with the cult member who picked him up at \tthe ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.  \n[77]\t\t    Thank you all for your efforts, \t\t    but I'm afraid we can no longer get \t\t    into Malkovich through the portal.  \n[78]\t\t    I'm not certain, my dear, but I \t\t    believe your husband has somehow \t\t    psychically diverted the route.  \n[79]\t\t    I'm afraid that no physical harm \t\t    must come to him as long as he \t\t    inhabits the vessel.  \n[80]\t\t    Actually, my friends, I suppose its \t\t    time I told you, I'm Captain James \t\t    Mertin.  \tThe members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes \tsome refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on \ta board. He then rearranges them for a while.  \n[81]\t\t    You see, Lester is an anagram for \t\t    Mertin.  \tLester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little \ttense now.  \n[82]\t\t    It used to work, I'm sure of it.  \tSeveral members check their watches.  \n[83]\t\t    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.  \tL-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns \tfrom the board to face the congregation.  \n[84]\t\t\t \t\t    I'm two hundred and five, truth be \t\t    told.  \n[85]\t\t    Lots of carrot juice, little lady. \t\t    That, and a deal with the Devil.  \tThere is a lot of murmuring in the room now.  \n[86]\t\t    Surprise.  \tThe cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.  \n[87]\t\t    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get \t\t    into Malkovich, we still get to rule \t\t    the world, just like I told you. The \t\t    only difference is that we rule in the \t\t    name of evil, instead of good.  \tPeople stop in their tracks.  \n[88]\t\t    Absolutely.  \tThe cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.  \n[89]\t\t    So anyway...  \tLotte stands.  \n[90]\t\t    My dear, let me assure you that when \t\t    we attain power, it will be much more \t\t    pleasant for those inside Malkovich, \t\t    than for those outside.  \tLotte stops and turns.  \n[91]\t\t    Anybody else?  \n[92]\t\t    But of course.  \n[93]\t\t    Good. I think its time to beckon \t\t    Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us \t\t    out of this pickle.  \n[94] \tMr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and \tblazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch \thim.  \n[95]\t\t    And as I said, sir, we can't very \t\t    well exert physical persuasion upon \t\t    the sacred vessel Malkovich.  \n[96]\t\t    Didn't mean to imply that you were, \t\t    sir.  \n[97]\t\t    Blasphemous bastard.  \tMalkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly \tnimble and the audience \"oohs\" and \"aahs.\"  \n[98]\t\t\t \t\t    Pretty good though.  \tMalkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one \tknee and, with spread arms, begins singing: \"Kiss Today \tGoodbye.\"  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up \twith him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man \twith a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit \tappears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at \thim.  \n[99]\t\t    Not too shabby.  \tMantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a \tbeautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the \texit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some \tconcern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and \tsmiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On \tstage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and \tjuggling chainsaws.  \n[100]\t\t    It's just me, boss. I brought \t\t    croissants.  \tLester enters with a greasy white paper bag.  \n[101]\t\t    We saw his show at the Luxor last \t\t    night.  \n[102]\t\t    The kid's got talent. You've never \t\t    seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz \t\t    had him up there singing and dancing. \t\t    Impressions.  \n[103]\t\t    Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad \t\t    we can't kill him.  \n[104]\t\t    A scary dream?  \n[105]\t\t\t \t\t    I like that.  \n[106]\t\t    How'd it go? Did you say the \t\t    philodendron gets water or no?  \n[107]\t\t    What kind of circumstances?  \n[108]\t\t    The Great Mantini?  \n[109]\t\t    Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I \t\t    saw him do \"Tru\" with his sixty \t\t    foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.  \n[110]\t\t\t \t\t    Do tell. I love a good plan.  \n[111]\t\t    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me \t\t    the plan.  \n[112]\t\t    Can you do that? I mean, do you know \t\t    anything about puppetry?  \n[113]\t\t    I was just asking. No disrespect \t\t    intended.  \n[114]\t\t    Fine. I mean, it's not like I was \t\t    doubting you, it's just that I know \t\t    puppetry is a skill that takes a long \t\t    time to acquire.  \n[115]\t\t    Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen \t\t    table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a \t\t    letter from Alex Trebek.  ", "Derek": "", "Mantini": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\t    Make one empty.  \n[2]\t\t    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.  \tAt this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich \ta spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the \tcultists get up.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\t    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.  \n[4]\t\t    Yeah, I saw them  \n[5]\t\t    Very impressive. I could use a \t\t    producer with your vision. And \t\t    other outstanding attributes.  \n[6]\t\t    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.  \n[7]\t\t    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or \t\t    more importantly, mine. Here's my \t\t    proposal: There's only room in this \t\t    world for one \"World's Greatest \t\t    Puppeteer.\"  Correct? So let's allow \t\t    the puppet-going public to crown \t\t    their king.  \n[8]\t\t    A friendly competition, if you will. \t\t    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. \t\t    Truman puppet appear opposite each \t\t    other in a play. Not some Vegas \t\t    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play \t\t    that requires actual acting. The \t\t    audience decides who is more deserving \t\t    of the title. The losing puppeteer \t\t    bows out graciously. Goes back to \t\t    obscurity as a file clerk.  \n[9]\t\t    Say... \"Equus\"? It's got everything.  \n[10]\t\t    Broadway's finest three hours. It's \t\t    about the suppression of the \t\t    individual. Conformity as God in \t\t    modern society.  \n[11]\t\t    Nothing but acting to hide behind, \t\t    buddy-boy.  \n[12]\t\t    Great then.  \n[13]\t\t    No.  \n[14]\t\t\t \t\t    I can't wait to see where you and your \t\t    friends live, Lotte.  ", "Maxine": "\n[1]\t\t    Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. \t\t    The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil \t\t    that it could never be revealed \t\t    to Americans raised on sitcoms and \t\t    happy news anchors.  \n[2]\t\t    Well, truth is for suckers, isn't \t\t    it?.  \n[3]\t\t    How dreary - to be - Somebody / \t\t    How public - like a Frog / \t\t    To tell one's name - the livelong June / \t\t    To an admiring Bog!  \n[4]\t\t    I wouldn't know.  \tMaxine walks away.  \n[5]\t\t    Yes, well...  \n[6]\t\t    And fifty other lines to get into \t\t    a girl's pants.  \n[7]\t\t    You know, if you ever got me, you \t\t    wouldn't have a clue what to do \t\t    with me. That's the thing, Romeo.  \tMaxine walks away.  \n[8]\t\t    What?  \n[9]\t\t    Yeah.  \n[10]\t\t    Why not?  \n[11]\t\t    Who told you?  \n[12]\t\t    Who told you?  \n[13]\t\t    Somebody told you.  \n[14]\t\t    I am dubious, but I don't welsh. \t\t    Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven \t\t    o'clock. You're late, I walk. So \t\t    help me, if I find out you cheated.  \n[15]\t\t    Just.  \n[16]\t\t    You married?  \n[17]\t\t\t \t\t    The usual, Barry.  \n[18]\t\t    My tits?  \n[19]\t\t    Christ, you're not a fag are you? \t\t    Because I don't want to be wasting \t\t    my time.  \tThe drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of \ta glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows \tswimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an \tplastic monkeys hang from the rim.  \n[20]\t\t    Don\u0092t let the girly shit fool you. \t\t    It'd blow your shorts off.  \tMaxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the \tempty glass to the bartender.  \n[21]\t\t    Set me up again, Barry.  \tThe bartender walks away with the empty glass.  \n[22]\t\t    You're a fag or a liar.  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\t    I mean, I am really attracted to \t\t    you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can \t\t    share recipes, if you like, Darlene.  \tMaxine gets up.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\t    Good. Now we're getting somewhere. \t\t\t \t\t    Not a chance.  \tMaxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the \tglass toward the bartender.  \n[25]\t\t    So, tell me about yourself. If you \t\t    can get your mind out of the gutter \t\t    long enough, dog-boy.  \n[26]\t\t\t \t\t    Check.  \n[27]\t\t    You're not someone I could get \t\t    interested in. Craig. You play \t\t    with dolls.  \n[28]\t\t    Yikes.  \n[29]\t\t    You might want to check those tarot \t\t    cards one more time.  \tMaxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts \this head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he \tnotices a very small door with a two by four nailed across \tit.  \n[30] \tMaxine sits at her desk, eats a sandwich. looks at a \tfashion magazine, and chats on the phone.  \n[31]\t\t    The puppeteer told me he loves me \t\t    today. \t\t\t \t\t    I know. I can't think of anything \t\t    more pathetic.  \n[32] \tMaxine sits behind her desk with her feet up, and talks on \tthe phone.  \n[33]\t\t    Absolutely, doll. I'm just about \t\t    to close up here.  \tCraig walks in disheveled and exhausted. Maxine sees him, \tkeeps talking.  \n[34]\t\t\t \t\t    Meet you at \u0093The Pig\u0094 in twenty \t\t    minutes. \t\t\t \t\t    Oh yeah, maybe I'll keep my legs \t\t    closed till then. \t\t\t \t\t    I'm splitting for the day. Lock up \t\t    for me, won't you, darling.  \tMaxine stands, puts some stuff in her purse.  \n[35]\t\t\t \t\t    No.  \tMaxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm.  \n[36]\t\t\t \t\t    It better be.  \tCraig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.  \n[37]\t\t    Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is \t\t    John Malkovich?  \n[38]\t\t    What's he been in?  \n[39]\t\t    Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?  \n[40]\t\t    Good. We'll sell tickets.  \n[41]\t\t    Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.  \n[42]\t\t    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going \t\t    to offer a partnership to you, but \t\t    this way it's more money for me.  \n[43]\t\t\t \t\t    Sure. It'd be fun.  \n[44]\t\t    I'll protect you, Dollface.  \tMaxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately \tbetween her thumb and forefinger.  \n[45] \tCraig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in.  \n[46] \tMaxine sits at her desk composing an ad. Craig stands \tbehind her, ostensibly looking over her shoulder, but \tactually studying the back of her head. He sighs.  \n[47]\t\t    Okay. Here it is. \t\t\t \t\t    Ever want to be someone else? Now you \t\t    can. No kidding. Only two hundred \t\t    dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit \t\t    J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. \t\t    etc., etc.  \n[48]\t\t\t \t\t    Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. \t\t\t \t\t    Hi, are you Craig's wife?  \n[49]\t\t    Hi, uh. \t\t\t \t\t    Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. \t\t    \"Ever want to be someone else?\" \t\t    No, that's the ad, but let's talk \t\t    about you in a minute. \"Ever want \t\t    to be someone else? Now you can. \t\t    No kidding...\"  \n[50]\t\t\t \t\t    Let her go, Craig. I mean \u0093him.\"  \n[51]\t\t    You better hurry. Traffic.  \tMaxine tosses Craig his car keys. He heads out the door. \tMaxine dials the phone.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\t    Davey? Max. Get me John Malkovich's \t\t    home phone? That's great. Love ya \t\t    and owe ya.  \n[53]\t\t\t \t\t    Mr. Malkovich?  \n[54]\t\t    You don't know me, but I'm a great \t\t    admirer of yours.  \n[55]\t\t    It's just that I fantasize about \t\t    you and, well, speaking to you \t\t    now has gotten me sort of excited \t\t    and...  \n[56]\t\t    Hi. I'm so glad you decided to \t\t    come. I'm Maxine.  \tMaxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes \ther hand.  \n[57]\t\t    And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, \t\t    my voice is probably the least \t\t    intriguing thing about me.  \n[58]\t\t    Whatever you're having.  \n[59]\t\t    Ah.  \n[60]\t\t\t \t\t    The way I see it, the world is divide \t\t    into those go after what they want \t\t    and those who don't. The passionate \t\t    ones, the ones who go after what they \t\t    want, may not get what they want, but \t\t    they remain vital, in touch with \t\t    themselves, and when they lie on \t\t    their deathbeds, they have few \t\t    regrets. The ones who don't go \t\t    after what they want... well, who \t\t    gives a shit about them anyway?  \tMaxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the \tsame moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and \tstart kissing her passionately about the face and neck. \tThey stop just as suddenly and look at each other.  \n[61]\t\t    Craig, I just don't find you \t\t    attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten \t\t    with you, but only when you're in \t\t    Malkovich. When I looked into his \t\t    eyes last night, I could feel you \t\t    peering out. Behind the stubble and \t\t    the too-prominent brow and the male \t\t    pattern baldness, I sensed your \t\t    feminine longing peering out, and \t\t    it just slew me.  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\t    Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. \t\t\t \t\t    Thanks for a wonderful dinner. \t\t\t \t\t    No hard feelings, partner.  \tMaxine exits. Craig and Lotte look at each other.  \n[63] \tIt is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks. \tThe wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every \tonce in a while looking up and discreetly checking out \tMaxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.  \n[64]\t\t    No.  \n[65]\t\t    No. Don't be an ass.  \n[66]\t\t    You can be John Malkovich.  \n[67]\t\t    Two hundred dollars, please.  \n[68] \tCraig kneels at the door and peeks out through the mail \tslot. Maxine sits at her desk and files her toenails.  \n[69]\t\t    So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.  \tCraig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door \tbehind him, locks it.  \n[70]\t\t    Crackpot.  \tCraig opens the door. The first few fat people move noisily \tinto the room.  \n[71] \tThe phone rings. Maxine sleepily picks it up.  \n[72]\t\t    Yes?  \n[73]\t\t    When?  \n[74] \tThe doorbell rings. Maxine, in a sheer black nightgown, \tanswers it. John Malkovich stands there.  \n[75]\t\t    Thanks so much for coming over.  \n[76] \tLotte sits on the floor in the dark. She leans, out of \tbreath, against the wall next to the portal and checks her \twatch. The time is 4:10. She pulls open the door.  \n[77] \tMaxine and Malkovich sit a bit awkwardly next to each other \ton the couch.  \n[78]\t\t    So, do you enjoy being an actor?  \n[79]\t\t    I love you, Lotte.  \n[80]\t\t    Do you mind?  \n[81]\t\t    Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.  \n[82] \tCraig enters with red-rimmed eyes. Maxine sits at her \tdesk, actually looking kind of radiant.  \n[83]\t\t    You're late.  \n[84]\t\t\t \t\t    I've fallen in love.  \n[85]\t\t    You picked the unrequited variety. \t\t    Very bad for the skin.  \n[86]\t\t    Do you have any idea what its like \t\t    to have two people look at you with \t\t    total lust and devotion through the \t\t    same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose \t\t    you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.  \tCraig turns and walks out the door.  \n[87]\t\t    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else \t\t    can be.  \n[88]\t\t    Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's \t\t    business hours. I need to keep the \t\t    membranous tunnel open for paying \t\t    customers.  \n[89]\t\t    Oooh, doll. I love this new \t\t    devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty, \t\t    I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll \t\t    see both of you in one hour. \t\t    Exactamundo.  \tMaxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs \tit up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed, \tand motions with the gun for Lotte to enter.  \n[90]\t\t    Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...  \tWe now watch the scene from Malkovich's POV.  \n[91] \tCraig is toweling himself off, hurriedly combing his \thair. Maxine enters.  \n[92]\t\t    A girl has a right to glow if \t\t    she wants. It's in the fucking \t\t    constitution.  \tMaxine sits. Craig smiles to himself.  \n[93] \tMalkovich and Maxine are having sex on Maxine's couch.  \n[94]\t\t    Lotte, this is so good...  \n[95]\t\t    Lotte? Is that you?  \n[96]\t\t    Oh, Lotte...  \tMaxine kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. There is a \tsucking sound.  \n[97] \tA panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.  \n[98]\t\t    Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion \t\t    for me taking hold.  \n[99] \tCraig and Malkovich enter. Maxine looks up, startled, but \tcontrolling it.  \n[100]\t\t    Darling!  \n[101]\t\t    Let him try.  \n[102]\t\t\t \t\t    How the hell would I know? I wasn't \t\t    a philosophy major.  \n[103]\t\t    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...  \n[104]\t\t    One hour.  \tCraig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.  \n[105]\t\t\t \t\t    Really? Well, you know, he's quite \t\t    good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have \t\t    a session with Malkovich I have to \t\t    attend. I'll speak with you soon.  \n[106]\t\t    I thought so too, doll. I guess we \t\t    were mistaken.  \tMaxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.  \n[107]\t\t    I can explain about the portal, \t\t    darling.  \n[108]\t\t    Oh shut up. \t\t\t \t\t    Craig, darling are you in there?  \tMalkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward, \tpuppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be \tagainst him will.  \n[109]\t\t    Lotte called me.  \n[110]\t\t    Apparently you can control this \t\t    Malkovich fellow now.  \n[111]\t\t    I'll say you are. Let's do it on his \t\t    kitchen table, then make him eat an \t\t    omelette off of it.  \n[112]\t\t    You still there, sweets?  \n[113]\t\t    Wow. \t\t\t \t\t    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.  \n[114]\t\t    I'd love to see your work.  \n[115]\t\t\t \t\t    That was incredible. You're brilliant!  \n[116]\t\t    You're right, my darling, it's \t\t    so much more. It's playing with \t\t    people!  \tMalkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.  \n[117]\t\t    Stay in him forever?  \n[118]\t\t    Well, we'll have all the money in \t\t    Malkovich's bank account, plus he \t\t    still gets acting work occasionally.  \n[119]\t\t    No one would ever have to know its \t\t    not him.  \n[120]\t\t    Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!  \n[121] \tMaxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal \twith cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the \toffice door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops \tjust as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.  \n[122]\t\t\t \t\t    It's okay, my sweet.  \tThey go back to filling the portal. There is the sound \tof many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies \topen and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst \tin. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.  \n[123]\t\t    Now excuse us, we have an \t\t    entertainment legend to create.  \n[124]\t\t    No thanks.  \n[125]\t\t    Vegas.  \n[126] \tThe cult members are still there, now with picks \tshovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is \texcavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 \temerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.  \n[127]\t\t    This is it, lover. You're stepping \t\t    onto that stage a nobody and \t\t    presto-change-o, you're coming \t\t    back the greatest puppeteer the \t\t    world has ever seen.  \n[128]\t\t    Doesn't he know how important \t\t    tonight is to us?  \n[129]\t\t    Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. \t\t    We're going to ride this straight to \t\t    the top.  \n[130]\t\t    Busy day, my little fire chief. Why \t\t    don't you climb into bed, and I'll \t\t    meet you there in just...  \tBut Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of \this clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts \tblanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.  \n[131]\t\t    Bad dream, darling?  \n[132]\t\t    You've got to be kidding.  \n[133]\t\t    Malkovich is our meal ticket. You \t\t    can't back out because of some \t\t    stupid dream.  \n[134]\t\t\t \t\t    Perhaps you'll want to consult that \t\t    Ouija board again.  \tThere is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.  \n[135]\t\t    Yeah what?!  \n[136]\t\t    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening \t\t    with Malkovich.  \n[137]\t\t    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.  \n[138]\t\t\t \t\t    Keep your eyes in your pants, old \t\t    timer.  \n[139]\t\t    You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics, \t\t    lover, 'cause right now you're running \t\t    neck and neck with the dead president. \t\t    And you're both in last place.  \tMalkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his \thead.  \n[140]\t\t    Whatever.  \tMalkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.  \n[141] \tLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds \tthe walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and \tthe Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, \twhile shrieking a war cry.  ", "Lund": "", "Captain": "", "Mertin": "\n[1]\t\t    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.  \tA tiny woman enters.  \n[2]\t\t    What want ye, girl child?  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\t    I see. Well, it is not my fault that \t\t    thou art tiny. So if it is charity \t\t    yer after, then be gone with ye, \t\t    ye foul demon.  \n[4]\t\t\t \t\t    Aye. Speak then if ye must.  \n[5]\t\t    Woman, your story moves me like n \t\t    other. Me own sister was tiny and \t\t    then died. Therefore, I shall make \t\t    ye me wife. And I shall build a \t\t    floor in my building, between the \t\t    7th and 8th, which will be scaled \t\t    down, so from now on there shall \t\t    be at least one place on God's green \t\t    Earth that you and your accursed \t\t    kind can live in peace...  \n[6] \tA man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast \tis clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of \tthe others, and enters the building.  ", "Lotte": "\n[1] \tCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, \tcrowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for \twork, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.   \n[2]\t\t    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin \t\t    Hatch was out of his pen. Good \t\t    morning.   \tLotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.  \n[3]\t\t    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms \t\t    coming in first thing.  \n[4]\t\t    Craig, listen, honey, I've been \t\t    thinking... maybe you'd feel better \t\t    if you got, you know, a job or \t\t    something.  \n[5]\t\t    Well, you know, maybe something else \t\t    until this whole puppet thing turns \t\t    around.  \n[6]\t\t\t \t\t    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. \t\t\t \t\t    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me \t\t    a favor?  \n[7]\t\t    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems \t\t    to be a little under the weather this \t\t    morning.  \n[8]\t\t    The monkey.  \n[9] \tThe place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. \tA small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. \tThe stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet \tversion of Craig. The \"Craig\" puppet paces back and forth, \twringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, \tabove and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. \tHis fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into \ta dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the \tpuppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one \twould think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on \tthe real Craig\u0092s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The \tpuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's \tbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special \tdevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet \tcollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to \tits face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down \taround the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches \toff the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.  \n[10] \tThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all \tkinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits \ton the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the \tbackground. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding \this stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is \tworking a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. \tThe assembled crowd is enthralled.   \n[11] \tCraig searches through Lotte's closet, looking for the \tright dress.  \n[12] \tCraig waxes his body, shaves his face.  \n[13] \tCraig paints his nails while he chats on the phone. Craig \tpulls stockings and underwear from Lotte's drawer. Craig \tpicks a wig from a mannequin head on Lotte's dressing table.   \n[14] \tCraig, at the sewing machine, is sewing padding to go onto \this chest and around his hips.  \n[15] \tCraig applies make up in the bathroom mirror.   \n[16] \tCraig, now looking very much like a woman, admires himself \tin the full length mirror.  \n[17]\t\t\t \t\t    Is the trial date set?  \n[18]\t\t    Why'd you do it, Craig?  \n[19] \tCraig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the \twant ads. He sees an ad for a company called \"WOMYN-TEERS\", \tlooking for \"an African-American, Lesbian Separatist \tPuppeteer for Community Outreach.\" Craig rubs his chin in \tthought, stands with determination.   \n[20] \tCraig applies a dark pancake make-up to his face.  \n[21] \tCraig pulls an afro-style wig off a mannequin head on \tLotte's dressing table.  \n[22]\t\t\t \t\t    Why, Craig. why?  \n[23] \tCraig reads the paper. He comes across an ad: \"Female \tpuppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of \t'Oh, Calcutta!'\"  Craig rubs his chin.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\t    You know, maybe you should speak to \t\t    someone about this.  \n[25] \tCraig sees a personal ad: \"Male puppeteer looking for \tattractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and \tmuch much more.\"  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better \tof it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a \t\"short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and \tdexterous fingers needed for speed filing.\"  Craig writes \tdown the address.  \n[26] \tLotte chops onions. A parrot sits on her head. Craig stirs \ta pot on the stove. A monkey leaps from the top of the \tcabinet to the top of the refrigerator to the kitchen table. \tA dog watches the monkey and barks at it.  \n[27]\t\t\t \t\t    Sorry, honey.  \tThe dog continues to bark.  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\t    Sorry!  \tLotte grabs the parrot off her head and leaves the room.  \n[29]\t\t    Isn't that cute? I just taught her \t\t    that.  \n[30]\t\t    Seven-ish  \n[31]\t\t    They'll understand. Besides I've got \t\t    a morning appointment tomorrow with \t\t    Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the \t\t    bottom of this acid stomach.  \n[32]\t\t    Some sort of childhood trauma, she \t\t    thinks. Possible feelings of \t\t    inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, \t\t    huh?  \n[33] \tThe dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their \tfriends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner. There \tis an obvious lull in the conversation.  \n[34]\t\t    Thanks. Craig helped, too, by the \t\t    way.  \n[35]\t\t    Yes. All vegetable. all the time.  \n[36] \tCraig washes the dishes. Lotte dries them. They don\u0092t \tlook at each other.  \n[37] \tCraig is at his workbench, painting the finishing touches \ton a new puppet. It is beautiful. It is Maxine. Lotte \twatches quietly from  the door. A Lotte puppet hangs \tfrom a hook, tangled and dusty.  \n[38]\t\t    New puppet?  \tCraig is surprised, caught.  \n[39]\t\t    She's very beautiful.  \n[40] \tThe room is dark. Lotte snores lightly. Craig lies there \twith his eyes open. Quietly, he gets up and leaves the \tbedroom. Lotte watches him go.  \n[41] \tLotte is combing Elijah. Craig enters.  \n[42]\t\t    Hi.  \n[43]\t\t    Did you eat?  \n[44]\t\t    I was worried.  \n[45]\t\t    Tom-Tom's puncture wound is \t\t    infected.  \n[46]\t\t    The iguana.  \n[47]\t\t    I dressed the wound. Then I've \t\t    just been feeding everyone, putting \t\t    everyone to bed.  \n[48]\t\t    No thanks. I'm going to turn in.  \n[49]\t\t    'kay.  \tLotte exits.  \n[50] \tCraig and Lotte are getting into evening clothes.  \n[51]\t\t    Don't be ridiculous. There is no such \t\t    thing as a portal into someone else's \t\t    brain.  \n[52]\t\t    I want to try.  \n[53]\t\t    I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow \t\t    morning. Plus I'd like to meet this \t\t    partner of yours.  \n[54]\t\t    Now?  \n[55]\t\t    I'm scared.  \tThe door slams shut.  \n[56]\t\t    Holy cow!  \tMalkovich steps out of the shower, slowly towels himself \tdry.  \n[57]\t\t    Oh, yes. Yes.  \n[58]\t\t    I have to go back.  \n[59]\t\t    I have to go back now.  \n[60] \tCraig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window.  \n[61]\t\t    I have to go back, Craig. Being \t\t    inside did something to me. All of a \t\t    sudden everything made sense. I knew \t\t    who I was.  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\t    I was, wasn't I? \t\t\t \t\t    I was John fucking Malkovich! \t\t\t \t\t    Take me back, Craig.  \n[63]\t\t    Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.  \n[64]\t\t    Dr. Lester, would you point me \t\t    toward the restroom?  \n[65] \tLotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in \tmuch the same way as Malkovich. Her eyes are closed. She \topens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror. \tDisappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the \tbathroom.  \n[66] \tCraig sits at his work table. He is pulling the heads off \tof the Craig and the Maxine puppets. He puts the Maxine \thead on the Craig puppet. He sighs.  \n[67]\t\t    Fuck pets. Is this your partner? \t\t    I had to come back and do the \t\t    Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything \t\t    else. Is this her?  \n[68]\t\t    Yes, Hi.  \n[69]\t\t    Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?  \n[70]\t\t    I've been going over and over my \t\t    experience last night. It was amazing. \t\t\t \t\t    I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't \t\t    that the craziest thing?  \n[71]\t\t    Everything felt right for the first \t\t    time. I need to go back to make sure, \t\t    then if the feeling is still there. \t\t    I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman \t\t    about sexual reassignment surgery.  \n[72]\t\t    Don't stand in the way of my \t\t    actualization as a man, Craig.  \n[73]\t\t    What raw, animal power!  \n[74]\t\t\t \t\t    Oh, I like this.  \n[75]\t\t    My God! \t\t\t \t\t    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet \t\t    her there. Meet her there. Meet her \t\t    there...  \tMalkovich goes back to his script.  \n[76]\t\t    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet \t\t    her there...  \tMalkovich picks up a pen and writes: Bernardo's 8:00.  \n[77]\t\t    I have to go back tonight. At eight \t\t    Exactly.  \n[78]\t\t    Don't crowd me, Craig.  \n[79]\t\t    Maxine!  \tMaxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.  \n[80]\t\t    God, she's beautiful. The way she's \t\t    looking at me. At him. At us.  \n[81]\t\t    I've never been looked at like this \t\t    by a woman.  \n[82] \tCraig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the \twindow.  \n[83]\t\t    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging \t\t    around his apartment. I think he must \t\t    be a lonely man.  \n[84]\t\t    You're right. You know I was thinking \t\t    that we should have Maxine over for \t\t    dinner. Since you two are partners \t\t    and all. It might be a nice gesture.  \n[85]\t\t    It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. \t\t    We\u0092ll smoke a joint. \t\t\t \t\t    Tensions will melt away.  \n[86] \tCraig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating \tlasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an \tawkward silence.  \n[87]\t\t\t \t\t    Did you know that Eskimos have not \t\t    one, but fifty words for snow. It's \t\t    because they have so much of it.  \n[88]\t\t    After that I'll introduce you to my \t\t    favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an \t\t    ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood \t\t    trauma. But we're getting to the \t\t    bottom of it. \t\t\t \t\t    Psychotherapy.  \tThere is another silence.  \n[89]\t\t    I want a divorce.  \n[90]\t\t\t \t\t    I'm getting divorced.  \n[91]\t\t    But why, Son of Malkovich?  \n[92] \tCraig is putting stuff in boxes. Lotte enters in her cloak.  \n[93]\t\t    What are you doing?  \n[94]\t\t    Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been \t\t    thinking. Let's try to work this out. \t\t    We've got so much history.  \n[95]\t\t    I'm getting rid of the fucking \t\t    animals.  \n[96]\t\t    I'm getting rid of the animals. I've \t\t    lost interest. Besides, they're \t\t    standing between you and me.  \n[97]\t\t    You've always hated the animals.  \n[98]\t\t    I'm giving them up. I've changed. \t\t    I've found a new focus.  \n[99]\t\t\t \t\t    Us, of course.  \tCraig looks up from his packing. He and Lotte stare at each \tother for a long while.  \n[100]\t\t    Fuck Maxine.  \n[101] \tThe clock reads 3:00 AM. Craig, in his pajamas, is working \tthe Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare \tpuppet stage. Craig seems possessed.  \n[102]\t\t    I have to see you. Can you call him \t\t    and invite us over?  \n[103]\t\t    Give me one hour to get inside him \t\t    Exactly.  \tMaxine checks her alarm clock. The time is 3:11 AM.  \n[104] \tLotte drives.  \n[105]\t\t    Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.  \n[106]\t\t    Maxine...  \n[107]\t\t    This is too good to be true.  \n[108] \tA sweaty and spent Craig sneaks back into the bedroom. \tHe sees that the bed is empty.  \n[109] \tCraig is hunched over a cup of coffee. The front door \tcan be heard to open. After a moment Lotte appears in \tthe kitchen doorway. She is caked with dirt. Craig \tlooks up at her.  \n[110]\t\t\t \t\t    Yes.  \n[111]\t\t    We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.  \n[112]\t\t    Me and John.  \n[113]\t\t    Well, you have the Maxine action \t\t    figure to play with.  \tCraig looks down at his coffee.  \n[114]\t\t    I'm sorry. That was nasty.  \n[115]\t\t    Sometimes we're forced to make \t\t    hard decisions. \t\t\t \t\t    I'd like for us to stay together, \t\t    Craig. You know, platonically, \t\t    if that's possible. I truly value \t\t    our friendship.  \n[116]\t\t    Dr. Lester, everything's falling \t\t    apart.  \n[117]\t\t    I blew it, Dr. Lester.  \n[118]\t\t    But now we've lost access to Craig.  \n[119] \tCraig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear \tthe front door unlock. Lotte enters. She does not see \tCraig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte \tscreams. Craig holds the gun to her head.  \n[120]\t\t    I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed \t\t    to cherish me forever. Now you hold \t\t    a gun to my head?  \n[121]\t\t    Suck my dick!  \n[122]\t\t\t \t\t    You bastard.  \tCraig cocks the pistol.  \n[123]\t\t\t \t\t    I have to see you.  \n[124]\t\t    What the hell, darling. Close early \t\t    today, live dangerously.  \n[125]\t\t\t \t\t    Help! He's locking me in a cage!  \tCraig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly.  \n[126] \tCraig is feeding the various caged animals. He puts two \tplates of food in Elijah's cage. Lotte is ungagged and \tunbound now. She eats as Craig slumps down next to the \tcage, gun in hand.  \n[127]\t\t    It'll never happen, fuckface.  \n[128]\t\t    What's that?  \n[129] \tA wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound \tand gagged.  \n[130] \tCraig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. \tHe gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She \tlooks haggard.  \n[131]\t\t    Once this was a relationship based \t\t    on love. Now you have me in a cage \t\t    with a monkey and a gun to my head.  \n[132]\t\t    You fell in love with her first.  \n[133]\t\t    You didn't do anything about it out \t\t    of respect for the fact that she \t\t    wouldn't let you near her with a ten \t\t    foot pole, which is, by the way, \t\t    about nine feet, nine inches off \t\t    the mark anyway.  \n[134]\t\t    Maybe this is what you've always \t\t    been, Craig, you just never faced \t\t    it before.  \n[135]\t\t    I need a shower.  \n[136]\t\t    You're not a monster, Craig. Just \t\t    a confused man.  \n[137]\t\t    We have to meet.  \n[138] \tElijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the \tropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He \tworks furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her \tmouth.  \n[139]\t\t    Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!  \tElijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks \tthe cage, and dials the phone.  \n[140]\t\t    Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me \t\t    in John the last three times. Craig's \t\t    had me locked up in the apartment. He \t\t    made me call you at gunpoint. It's \t\t    been him! Oh, God, it's been him!  \n[141]\t\t    But Maxine, I thought it was me you \t\t    loved.  \n[142]\t\t    Hello, Dr. Lester?  \n[143]\t\t    Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. \t\t    Lester.  \n[144]\t\t    No, you don't understand. I've been \t\t    inside Malkovich when I'm with \t\t    Maxine...  \n[145]\t\t    No, I didn't know that.  \n[146]\t\t    No.  \n[147]\t\t    Does Floris know that she's the \t\t    chosen?  \n[148]\t\t    I have sinned, unwittingly, against \t\t    the community. And for this I am \t\t    truly sorry.  \n[149]\t\t    Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.  \n[150]\t\t\t \t\t    You bastard!  \tLotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds \ther back.  \n[151]\t\t    It's Craig in there, I can tell.  \n[152]\t\t\t \t\t    Why not? I need to get in there!  \n[153]\t\t    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose \t\t    of him in the name of the order, Son \t\t    of Malkovich.  \n[154]\t\t    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will \t\t    not serve evil. I am ashamed of all \t\t    of you.  \tLotte heads for the door.  \n[155]\t\t    I'll take my chances.  \tShe exits.  \n[156] \tLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly \tsobbing. The caged animals watch her.  \n[157]\t\t    Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're \t\t    not human. People are treacherous \t\t    and greedy and corrupt. I've lost \t\t    my heart to two of them and I almost \t\t    lost my soul to another. And I'm no \t\t    better. Look at the way I keep you, \t\t    locked in cages, for my own enjoyment. \t\t    Well, I've been in a cage too, my \t\t    friends. Literally and figuratively. \t\t    So tonight I set you free.  \tLotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks \tall the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their \tcages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until \tshe is alone.  \n[158]\t\t    Good-bye, friends.  \tA hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still \tthere and holding her hand. She smiles.  \n[159]\t\t    Hello, friend  \n[160] \tLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. \tThe buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.  \n[161]\t\t    They've come to kill me, Elijah. See, \t\t    I know too much. I should get the \t\t    door. It's impolite to keep death \t\t    waiting.  \tElijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes. \tThen he leads her by the hand out the window.  \n[162]\t\t    They're going to take over the \t\t    world, Elijah. Evil will reign. \t\t    But, then, evil already reigns, \t\t    doesn't it? So what difference \t\t    does it make if John Malkovich \t\t    is wearing the fucking crown while \t\t    it's reigning?  \tElijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is \treturning.  \n[163]\t\t    I'm glad you learned sign language, \t\t    Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. \t\t    I'm tired of this conversation. I'm \t\t    tired period. What has the world ever \t\t    done for me that I should feel \t\t    personally responsible for saving it?  \n[164]\t\t    What have I become?  \n[165]\t\t    Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter \t\t    Malkovich and destroy him from the \t\t    inside. If not me, who?  \n[166]\t\t\t \t\t    Hush, sweetheart.  \tLotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb \ton her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then \tembrace.  \n[167]\t\t\t \t\t    I'll be with you always, my friends. \t\t    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll \t\t    rejoin you with wings and a beak.  \n[168]\t\t    My God!  \n[169]\t\t    I'm in love. For the first time. \t\t    It's funny, but when it happens to \t\t    you, there's no question.  \n[170]\t\t    It's Elijah.  \n[171]\t\t    The monkey.  \n[172]\t\t    A better friend.  \n[173]\t\t\t \t\t    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, \t\t    in an odd sort of way.  \n[174]\t\t    Yeah. I was going to kill him from \t\t    the inside.  \n[175]\t\t    You saw it once. Now you see it again. \t\t    That's life, isn't it? And you were \t\t    up here to try the same thing, weren't \t\t    you?  \n[176]\t\t    I don't know. There's a small \t\t    community of us. We have a place they \t\t    don't know about. We're happy. We'll \t\t    keep trying to figure out a way. Come \t\t    stay with us. Join the struggle.  \n[177]\t\t    People make mistakes.  \n[178]\t\t    I know.  \n[179]\t\t    Sure. We could really use a farmer. \t\t    We'd be grateful for the help. \t\t\t \t\t    Also, I think, you know, if you \t\t    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little \t\t    puppet show every once in a while, \t\t    would do a lot to lift our spirits. \t\t    You know, if you wouldn't mind too \t\t    terribly.  \tCraig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.  \n[180]\t\t    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.  \tShe puts her arm around him and leads him toward the \televator.  \n[181]\t\t    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.  \tNow we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w \tfollow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.  ", "Schwartz": "", "Craig": "\n[1] \tCraig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest, \tcrowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for \twork, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.   \n[2]\t\t    Morning.  \n[3]\t\t    Enjoy.  \n[4]\t\t    We've been over this. Nobody's \t\t    looking for a puppeteer in today's \t\t    wintry economic climate.  \n[5]\t\t\t \t\t    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day \t\t    job.  \n[6]\t\t    What?  \n[7]\t\t    Which one is Elijah again?  \n[8]\t\t    Yeah. Okay.  \n[9] \tThe place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers. \tA small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage. \tThe stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet \tversion of Craig. The \"Craig\" puppet paces back and forth, \twringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig, \tabove and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet. \tHis fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into \ta dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the \tpuppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one \twould think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on \tthe real Craig\u0092s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The \tpuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's \tbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special \tdevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet \tcollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to \tits face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down \taround the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches \toff the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.  \n[10] \tThe room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all \tkinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits \ton the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the \tbackground. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding \this stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is \tworking a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower. \tThe assembled crowd is enthralled.   \n[11]\t\t    Gimmicky bastard.  \tCraig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a \tfemale puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs \this chin in thought, then stands with great determination.   \n[12] \tCraig searches through Lotte's closet, looking for the \tright dress.  \n[13] \tCraig waxes his body, shaves his face.  \n[14] \tCraig paints his nails while he chats on the phone. Craig \tpulls stockings and underwear from Lotte's drawer. Craig \tpicks a wig from a mannequin head on Lotte's dressing table.   \n[15] \tCraig, at the sewing machine, is sewing padding to go onto \this chest and around his hips.  \n[16] \tCraig applies make up in the bathroom mirror.   \n[17] \tCraig, now looking very much like a woman, admires himself \tin the full length mirror.  \n[18]\t\t    May 11th.   \n[19]\t\t    I'm a puppeteer.  \tThey drive in silence.  \n[20] \tCraig sits on the couch in his bathrobe and studies the \twant ads. He sees an ad for a company called \"WOMYN-TEERS\", \tlooking for \"an African-American, Lesbian Separatist \tPuppeteer for Community Outreach.\" Craig rubs his chin in \tthought, stands with determination.   \n[21] \tCraig applies a dark pancake make-up to his face.  \n[22] \tCraig pulls an afro-style wig off a mannequin head on \tLotte's dressing table.  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\t    I... puppeteer.  \n[24] \tCraig reads the paper. He comes across an ad: \"Female \tpuppeteer wanted for nudist colony marionette staging of \t'Oh, Calcutta!'\"  Craig rubs his chin.  \n[25] \tCraig sees a personal ad: \"Male puppeteer looking for \tattractive female puppeteer for friendship, travel, and \tmuch much more.\"  Craig rubs his chin, then thinks better \tof it and sighs. He finds a want ad calling for a \t\"short-statured file clerk with unusually nimble and \tdexterous fingers needed for speed filing.\"  Craig writes \tdown the address.  \n[26]\t\t    Uh. yeah.  \n[27]\t\t    Thank you.  \tCraig climbs out onto the 7 1/2 floor.  \n[28]\t\t    No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. \t\t    I have an interview with Mr. Lester.  \n[29]\t\t    Schwartz.  \n[30]\t\t    Schwartz.  \n[31]\t\t    My name is Schwartz.  \n[32]\t\t    Forget it.  \tCraig takes a seat next to the other applicants.  \n[33]\t\t    Yes?  \n[34]\t\t    I said \"yes.\"  \n[35]\t\t\t \t\t    Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, \t\t    Dr. Lester.  \tLester flips an intercom switch.  \n[36]\t\t    No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with \t\t    your secretary.  \n[37]\t\t    Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply \t\t    misspoke.  \n[38]\t\t    Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.  \n[39]\t\t    Glooph is not a letter, sir.\t  \n[40]\t\t    You don't have a speech impediment, \t\t    Dr. Lester.  \n[41]\t\t    No.  \n[42]\t\t    No. I understand perfectly.  \n[43]\t\t    Just one. Why is this floor so short?  \n[44]\t\t    Moving story.  \n[45]\t\t    Is that true?  \n[46]\t\t    Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just \t\t    starting out at LesterCorp.  \n[47]\t\t\t \t\t    Emily Dickinson.  \n[48] \tLotte chops onions. A parrot sits on her head. Craig stirs \ta pot on the stove. A monkey leaps from the top of the \tcabinet to the top of the refrigerator to the kitchen table. \tA dog watches the monkey and barks at it.  \n[49]\t\t    Shut up!  \n[50]\t\t    Adorable. What time are they supposed \t\t    to be here?  \n[51]\t\t    We have to make it an early night.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\t    Hmmm.  \n[53]\t\t    Hmmm.  \tThe doorbell rings. The dog barks. The parrot screams. \tThe neighbor pounds on the wall.  \n[54] \tThe dining room table is set up. Craig and Lotte and their \tfriends Peter and Gloria are seated and eating dinner. There \tis an obvious lull in the conversation.  \n[55]\t\t    No kidding, Peter.  \n[56] \tCraig washes the dishes. Lotte dries them. They don\u0092t \tlook at each other.  \n[57]\t\t\t \t\t    Thank you, Floris.  \tFloris shrugs, shakes her head.  \n[58]\t\t    I am a trained performer.  \n[59]\t\t    Hello again.  \tCraig fills her cup.  \n[60]\t\t    You know, I've been thinking about \t\t    what you said yesterday, about the \t\t    orientation film being a cover-up. \t\t    I think you're on to something.  \n[61]\t\t    No, really.  \n[62] \tCraig is at his workbench, painting the finishing touches \ton a new puppet. It is beautiful. It is Maxine. Lotte \twatches quietly from  the door. A Lotte puppet hangs \tfrom a hook, tangled and dusty.  \n[63]\t\t    Yeah, just an idea I had.  \n[64]\t\t\t \t\t    Just an idea I had.  \tCraig hangs the puppet, stands, and switches off the light.  \n[65]\t\t    C'mon, let's go to bed.  \n[66] \tThe room is dark. Lotte snores lightly. Craig lies there \twith his eyes open. Quietly, he gets up and leaves the \tbedroom. Lotte watches him go.  \n[67]\t\t\t \t\t    I would too know what to do with you.  \n[68]\t\t    Floris, you're very nice, but I'm \t\t    afraid I\u0092m in love with somebody \t\t    else.  \n[69]\t\t    I wasn't toying with her, sir. I \t\t    was just... How old are you?  \n[70]\t\t    I'll keep that in mind, sir.  \n[71]\t\t    The elderly have so much to offer, \t\t    sir. They are our link with history.  \n[72]\t\t    Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that \t\t    you share your feelings with me, I \t\t    believe perhaps the workplace is not \t\t    the most suitable environment for \t\t    this type of discussion.  \n[73]\t\t    Shit.  \n[74]\t\t\t \t\t    I won't be late. I just have to \t\t    listen to Lester's sexual fantasies \t\t    and drink carrot juice for a little \t\t    while. It's a job thing.  \tMaxine walks by. Craig grabs her arm, signals for her \tto wait a minute. She waits.  \n[75]\t\t\t \t\t    I gotta go back to work. Yeah, \t\t    okay. You too. Okay. Bye.  \tCraig hangs up.  \n[76]\t\t    I just wanted to say \u0093hi.\u0094  Did \t\t    you know I still don't know your \t\t    name or where you work?  \n[77]\t\t    How about this, if I can guess your \t\t    first name within three tries, you \t\t    have to come out for a drink with me \t\t    tonight.  \n[78]\t\t    Great. \t\t\t \t\t    Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . \t\t    Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . \t\t    nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . \t\t    tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . \t\t    nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee \t\t    Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . \t\t    sssseeeeeen. Maxine?  \n[79]\t\t    I'm right?  \n[80]\t\t    That's incredible! Nobody told me! \t\t    I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! \t\t    It's a beautiful name. There's a \t\t    psychic connection. Don't you see? \t\t    It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! \t\t    Maxine! I will shout it from the \t\t    rooftops!  \n[81]\t\t    Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, \t\t    Maxine. It just came out of me like \t\t    a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, \t\t    song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!  \n[82]\t\t\t \t\t    Maxine.  \tCraig walks down the hall. A tiny smile flits across \tMaxine's face.  \n[83]\t\t\t \t\t    Dr. Lester, it's been really \t\t    fascinating, but I'm afraid I have \t\t    to get home to my wife now.  \n[84]\t\t    Yessir.  \n[85]\t\t\t \t\t    That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta \t\t    run.  \tCraig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice, \tsignals the waiter for more.  \n[86]\t\t    Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, \t\t    Maxine.  \n[87]\t\t    Buy you a drink, Maxine?  \n[88]\t\t    Yeah. But enough about me.  \tMaxine laughs. The bartender approaches.  \n[89]\t\t    What'll you have?  \n[90]\t\t\t \t\t    I'll have, like, a beer. Like a \t\t    Budweiser, or something.  \tThe bartender walks away.  \n[91]\t\t    I like you. I don't know what it \t\t    is exactly.  \n[92]\t\t    No, no, it's your energy or your \t\t    attitude or the way you carry \t\t    yourself or...  \n[93]\t\t    That's the usual?  \n[94]\t\t    I\u0092m not a homosexual. I just like \t\t    women for more than their bodies. \t\t    I guess you could say I'm the new \t\t    American male.  \n[95]\t\t\t \t\t    I mean, I am really attracted to \t\t    you.  \n[96]\t\t\t \t\t    No, wait! I like your tits. \t\t\t \t\t    I love your tits. I want to fuck \t\t    you.  \n[97]\t\t    Well, I'm a puppeteer...  \tThe bartender comes back with Maxine's drink.  \n[98] \tLotte is combing Elijah. Craig enters.  \n[99]\t\t    Hi.  \n[100]\t\t\t \t\t    Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just \t\t    wouldn't let me go. We\u0092re supposed \t\t    to have dinner with him on Friday. \t\t    I can get us out of it if you want. \t\t    He's really amazing, this insane old \t\t    lech. It's actually sort of amusing \t\t    when you get past just how disgusting \t\t    it is.  \tThere is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah. \tFinally:  \n[101]\t\t    Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I \t\t    didn't call. It was just, you know, \t\t    hard to get away.  \n[102]\t\t    I'm sorry. How was your evening?  \n[103]\t\t    The ferret?  \n[104]\t\t    Right.  \n[105]\t\t    Yeah. You want a beer?  \n[106]\t\t    All right. I'll be in my workshop \t\t    for a little while. I'll be in in \t\t    a little while. I need to unwind a \t\t    little. \t\t\t \t\t    I'll be in soon. A little while.  \n[107]\t\t\t \t\t    Tell me, Craig, why do you love \t\t    puppeteering? \t\t\t \t\t    Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly. \t\t    Perhaps it's the idea of becoming \t\t    someone else for a little while. \t\t    Being inside another skin. Moving \t\t    differently, thinking differently, \t\t    feeling differently. \t\t\t \t\t    Interesting. Would you like to be \t\t    inside my skin, Craig? Think what I \t\t    think? Feel what I feel? \t\t\t \t\t    More than anything. Maxine. \t\t\t \t\t    It's good in here, Craig. Better \t\t    than your wildest dreams.  \tThe puppets kiss.  \n[108]\t\t    Hi.  \n[109]\t\t\t \t\t    Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea \t\t    of being inside someone else, \t\t    feeling what they feel, seeing \t\t    what they see...  \n[110]\t\t    Please, let me explain.  \tCraig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty \toffice.  \n[111]\t\t    It's just, and I've never done \t\t    this before, Maxine, but it's just \t\t    that I feel something for you. I've \t\t    never felt this before for anyone, \t\t    not even my wife. My future is with \t\t    you, Maxine.  \n[112]\t\t    Another evil secret of the 7 1/2 \t\t    floor.  \tCraig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a \tdark and wet membranous tunnel inside.  \n[113]\t\t    Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love \t\t    this.  \tCraig lets go of the door and it slams shut.  \n[114]\t\t    Dr. Lester. . .  \n[115]\t\t    Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was \t\t    in that vacant office down the hall \t\t    and I stumbled upon a little door \t\t    and....  \n[116]\t\t    Thank you, sir.  \tCraig exits. Lester waits a moment. then dials the phone.  \n[117]\t\t    Bullshit.  \tCraig exits. The usher mumbles something into a \twalkie-talkie.  \n[118]\t\t\t \t\t    Whoa! What the hell? Where am I?  \tWe're still in POV. The person walks across the room, picks \tup his wallet from a coffee table. looks in a mirror and \tchecks his teeth for food. It's John Malkovich.  \n[119]\t\t    Holy shit! It's that actor guy. \t\t    Shit! What's his name? That actor \t\t    guy! What's happening? Am I \t\t    inside him? Am I in his brain? \t\t    Am I him? Is he me? Does he know \t\t    I'm here? My brain is reeling! \t\t    Is his brain reeling?  \tMalkovich walks to the front door, opens it, exits his \tapartment.  \n[120]\t\t    John Malkovich! Of course!  \n[121]\t\t    John fucking Malkovich!  \n[122]\t\t\t \t\t    Ahhhh!  \tThe image starts to fade, then suddenly goes black.  \n[123]\t\t    Don't you want to know what happened \t\t    to me?  \n[124]\t\t    This is important!  \n[125]\t\t    There's a tiny door in that empty \t\t    office. It's a portal, Maxine. It \t\t    takes you inside John Malkovich. \t\t    You see the world through John \t\t    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about \t\t    fifteen minutes, you're spit out into \t\t    a ditch on the side of The New Jersey \t\t    Turnpike.  \n[126]\t\t    He's an actor. One of the great \t\t    American actors of the 20th century.  \n[127]\t\t    Lots of things. He's very well \t\t    respected. That jewel thief movie, \t\t    for example. The point is that this \t\t    is a very odd thing, supernatural, \t\t    for lack of a better word. It raises \t\t    all sorts of philosophical questions \t\t    about the nature of self, about the \t\t    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is \t\t    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha \t\t    right, is duality an illusion? Do \t\t    you see what a can of worms this \t\t    portal is? I don't think I can go \t\t    on living my life as I have lived \t\t    it. There's only one thing to do. \t\t    Let's get married right away.  \n[128]\t\t    Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.  \n[129]\t\t    Tickets to Malkovich?  \n[130]\t\t    But there's something profound here, \t\t    Maxine, we can't exploit it.  \n[131]\t\t    You wanted to be partners with me?  \n[132]\t\t\t \t\t    Really? \t\t\t \t\t    But, Maxine, can of worms! End of \t\t    the world! Illusory nature of \t\t    existence!  \n[133]\t\t\t \t\t    Oh. Maxine.  \n[134] \tCraig and Lotte are getting into evening clothes.  \n[135]\t\t    Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. \t\t    I was right inside him looking out. \t\t    We're going to be rich.  \n[136]\t\t    What?  \n[137]\t\t\t \t\t    Well, you know we're going to be \t\t    very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you \t\t    what. Let's do it tonight. Right \t\t    now.  \n[138]\t\t    Yeah. We'll do it right now. On \t\t    the way to Lester's house.  \n[139] \tCraig holds open the small door as Lotte climbs in.  \n[140]\t\t    I'll meet you on the turnpike.  \n[141]\t\t    Me too, babe.  \tCraig hurries out the door.  \n[142]\t\t    Okay. Maybe tomorrow.  \n[143]\t\t    We'll talk about it in the car.  \tCraig helps Lotte up and toward the car.  \n[144] \tCraig drives. Lotte looks distractedly out the window.  \n[145]\t\t    You weren't you. You were John \t\t    Malkovich.  \n[146]\t\t    Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.  \n[147]\t\t    Dr. Lester...  \n[148]\t\t    No thank you sir. It's delicious, \t\t    though. I just wanted to thank you \t\t    for the opportunity to work at \t\t    LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm \t\t    going to have to tender my resignation \t\t    effectively immediately.  \n[149]\t\t    No sir, not at all. It's just that \t\t    I'm going to open my own business \t\t    and...  \n[150]\t\t    Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right \t\t    on 7 1/2 actually. \t\t\t \t\t    In the vacant office. So we'll still \t\t    be seeing each other.  \n[151] \tLotte has just taken a shower. She towels herself dry in \tmuch the same way as Malkovich. Her eyes are closed. She \topens them slowly and sees herself in the mirror. \tDisappointedly, she drops the towel and heads out of the \tbathroom.  \n[152] \tCraig sits at his work table. He is pulling the heads off \tof the Craig and the Maxine puppets. He puts the Maxine \thead on the Craig puppet. He sighs.  \n[153]\t\t    My kingdom for your portal, Maxine.  \n[154] \tMaxine sits at her desk composing an ad. Craig stands \tbehind her, ostensibly looking over her shoulder, but \tactually studying the back of her head. He sighs.  \n[155]\t\t    Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. \t\t    Phone it in.  \tMaxine dials the phone. Lotte enters.  \n[156]\t\t    Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet \t\t    shop?  \n[157]\t\t    Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.  \tLotte and Maxine shake hands.  \n[158]\t\t\t \t\t    Why aren't you at work?  \n[159]\t\t    What, are you nuts? That's Oprah \t\t    talking.  \n[160]\t\t    This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an \t\t    allergist. If you're going to do \t\t    something, do it right.  \n[161]\t\t\t \t\t    It's just the thrill of seeing through \t\t    someone else's eyes, sweetie. It'll \t\t    pass.  \n[162]\t\t\t \t\t    Yeah, okay. \t\t\t \t\t    I'll pick you up.  \tLotte enters. Craig closes the door. stands there.  \n[163]\t\t    How was it?  \n[164]\t\t    Why?  \n[165] \tCraig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the \twindow.  \n[166]\t\t    So how was it? What was he doing?  \n[167]\t\t    You see, men can feel unfulfilled, \t\t    too. I'm glad you're realizing that. \t\t    You shouldn't be so quick to assume \t\t    that switching bodies would be the \t\t    answer to all your problems.  \n[168]\t\t    I don't know. There's some tension \t\t    between us. I'd hate to expose you to \t\t    that.  \n[169] \tCraig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating \tlasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an \tawkward silence.  \n[170]\t\t    After dinner I'll show you my puppets.  \n[171]\t\t    You?  \tLotte looks away.  \n[172]\t\t\t \t\t    My God.  \tLotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the \ttable.  \n[173] \tIt is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks. \tThe wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every \tonce in a while looking up and discreetly checking out \tMaxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.  \n[174]\t\t\t \t\t    Come in!  \tErroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.  \n[175]\t\t    Please, have a seat.  \tErroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He \tglances nervously over at Maxine.  \n[176]\t\t    Exactly that. We can put you inside \t\t    someone else's body for fifteen minutes.  \n[177]\t\t\t \t\t    Tell your friends.  \n[178] \tCraig kneels at the door and peeks out through the mail \tslot. Maxine sits at her desk and files her toenails.  \n[179]\t\t    This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!  \n[180]\t\t    Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're \t\t    talking about.  \n[181]\t\t    You're insane.  \n[182] \tCraig is putting stuff in boxes. Lotte enters in her cloak.  \n[183]\t\t    I'm moving. Remember? What's with \t\t    the hooded cloak?  \n[184]\t\t\t \t\t    You should feed your animals. They're \t\t    looking peaked.  \n[185]\t\t    What?  \n[186]\t\t    No they're not.  \n[187]\t\t    You've always loved the animals.  \n[188]\t\t    What's that?  \n[189]\t\t\t \t\t    Oh, Lot...  \tThey hug.  \n[190]\t\t    What about Maxine?  \n[191]\t\t    We wish.  \tThey look at each other and laugh, them fall back into the \tembrace. They both get faraway looks in their eyes.  \n[192] \tThe clock reads 3:00 AM. Craig, in his pajamas, is working \tthe Craig and Maxine puppets. They make love on the bare \tpuppet stage. Craig seems possessed.  \n[193] \tLotte drives.  \n[194] \tLotte sits on the floor in the dark. She leans, out of \tbreath, against the wall next to the portal and checks her \twatch. The time is 4:10. She pulls open the door.  \n[195] \tA sweaty and spent Craig sneaks back into the bedroom. \tHe sees that the bed is empty.  \n[196] \tCraig is hunched over a cup of coffee. The front door \tcan be heard to open. After a moment Lotte appears in \tthe kitchen doorway. She is caked with dirt. Craig \tlooks up at her.  \n[197]\t\t    You were him last night, weren't you?  \n[198]\t\t    And he was with her.  \n[199]\t\t    We?  \n[200]\t\t    Don't forget me.  \n[201]\t\t    Life is confusing, isn't it?  \n[202]\t\t    I feel that somehow my parents never \t\t    prepared me to make this particular \t\t    decision. Not that I blame them. How \t\t    could they know? Today's world is so \t\t    complicated. \t\t\t \t\t    No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, \t\t    Lotte. I'm so sorry.  \n[203] \tCraig enters with red-rimmed eyes. Maxine sits at her \tdesk, actually looking kind of radiant.  \n[204]\t\t    Are you torturing me on purpose?  \n[205]\t\t    I don't think so. I've fallen in \t\t    love. This is what people who've \t\t    fallen in love look like.  \n[206]\t\t    You're evil, Maxine.  \n[207] \tCraig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear \tthe front door unlock. Lotte enters. She does not see \tCraig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte \tscreams. Craig holds the gun to her head.  \n[208]\t\t    Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.  \n[209]\t\t\t \t\t    Shut up!  \tLotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead. \tShe shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig \tdials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his \tear to the receiver also.  \n[210]\t\t    Tell her you need to see her.  \n[211]\t\t\t \t\t    Tell her, what the hell, close \t\t    early today, live dangerously.  \n[212]\t\t    Lesson number one:  Be careful what \t\t    you teach your parrot.  \tCraig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah \twatches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and \tholds his stomach.  \n[213]\t\t    I can't believe it. This is too \t\t    good to be true.  \n[214] \tCraig is toweling himself off, hurriedly combing his \thair. Maxine enters.  \n[215]\t\t    You're glowing again.  \n[216] \tCraig is feeding the various caged animals. He puts two \tplates of food in Elijah's cage. Lotte is ungagged and \tunbound now. She eats as Craig slumps down next to the \tcage, gun in hand.  \n[217]\t\t    It was lovely being you being \t\t    Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen \t\t    the passionate side of sweet Maxine \t\t    before, or her actual tits for that \t\t    matter. If only, I've been thinking \t\t    to myself, if only I could actually \t\t    feel what Malkovich feels, rather \t\t    than just see what he sees... And \t\t    then, dare I say it, if only I could \t\t    control his arms, his legs, his \t\t    pelvis, and make them do my bidding.  \n[218]\t\t    Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, \t\t    Lambchop.  \n[219]\t\t    I'm a puppeteer.  \tCraig picks up the phone and dials. He smiles as he \tholds the receiver up to Lotte's face.  \n[220]\t\t\t \t\t    Move right hand across her left breast \t\t    now. Move right hand across her left \t\t    breast now. Move right hand across her \t\t    left breast now.  \tMalkovich clumsily, awkwardly moves his hand across Maxine's \tbreast.  \n[221]\t\t    Holy shit, yes!  \n[222]\t\t    Holy shit! He said what I said!  \n[223]\t\t    Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  \n[224] \tA wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound \tand gagged.  \n[225]\t\t    I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm \t\t    across your girlfriend's glorious tit. \t\t    I made him talk. And, oh, there was \t\t    the beginning of sensation in the \t\t    fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a \t\t    matter of practice before Malkovich \t\t    becomes nothing more than another \t\t    puppet hanging next to my worktable. \t\t    Coffee?  \n[226]\t\t    Hey! Break it up! Break it up! \t\t    Everybody gets a chance to be...  \tThe fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap \thave been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.  \n[227] \tCraig and Malkovich enter. Maxine looks up, startled, but \tcontrolling it.  \n[228]\t\t    Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig \t\t    Schwartz. I can explain. We operate \t\t    a little business her that... \t\t    simulates, for our clientele, the \t\t    experience of... being you, actually.  \n[229]\t\t    Sure, after a fashion.  \n[230]\t\t    You? Why I'm sure it would pale in \t\t    comparison to the actual experience.  \n[231]\t\t    Of course, right this way, Mr. \t\t    Malkovich. Compliments of the house.  \tCraig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.  \n[232]\t\t    What happens when a man climbs \t\t    through his own portal?  \n[233]\t\t    So how was it?  \n[234]\t\t    I know. I'm sorry...  \n[235]\t\t    Really? For most people it's a rather \t\t    pleasant experience. What exactly did \t\t    you...  \n[236]\t\t    With all respect, sir, I discovered \t\t    that portal. Its my livelihood.  \n[237]\t\t\t \t\t    And who's to say I won't be seeing \t\t    what you're seeing... in court?  \tCars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.  \n[238] \tCraig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants. \tHe gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She \tlooks haggard.  \n[239]\t\t    Things change. Anyway, you gave up your \t\t    claim to that love the first time you \t\t    stuck your dick in Maxine.  \n[240]\t\t    Yeah but I didn't do anything about \t\t    it. Out of respect for our marriage.  \n[241]\t\t\t \t\t    That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what \t\t    have I become? My wife in a cage \t\t    with a monkey. A gun in my hand. \t\t    Betrayal in my heart.  \n[242]\t\t    Perhaps you're right. I can't let \t\t    you go though. Too much has happened. \t\t    You're my ace in the hole.  \n[243]\t\t    I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm \t\t    some kind of monster. I'm the guy \t\t    you read about in the paper and go, \t\t    \"he's some kind of monster.\"  \n[244]\t\t    I love you so much.  \tShe dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.  \n[245]\t\t    But I gotta go now. I've got to go \t\t    be Johnny.  \n[246]\t\t    I'll tell you all about it when I \t\t    get home.  \tCraig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands \tElijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly \twatches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow. \tSomething is going on in his brain. We move slowly into \this eyes.  \n[247] \tElijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the \tropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He \tworks furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her \tmouth.  \n[248] \tMaxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal \twith cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the \toffice door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops \tjust as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.  \n[249]\t\t    Squatter's rights, Lester.  \tCraig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm \tthrough Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances \ttriumphantly over at Lotte.  \n[250] \tThe cult members are still there, now with picks \tshovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is \texcavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2 \temerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.  \n[251] \tLotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly \tsobbing. The caged animals watch her.  \n[252] \tLotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps. \tThe buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.  \n[253]\t\t    Who are you?  \n[254]\t\t    Oh.  \n[255]\t\t    Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.  \n[256] \tLester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds \tthe walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and \tthe Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal, \twhile shrieking a war cry.  \n[257]\t\t    I'm so glad you're safe. You look \t\t    really wonderful.  \n[258]\t\t    He's a lucky man. \t\t\t \t\t    Do I know him?  \n[259]\t\t    The iguana?  \n[260]\t\t    Oh, right. As long as you're happy. \t\t    I'm sure he's a better lover than I \t\t    ever was.  \n[261]\t\t\t \t\t    I'm sorry for everything.  \n[262]\t\t    You came up here looking for the \t\t    portal?  \n[263]\t\t    And yourself too in the process. God, \t\t    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I \t\t    see that before?  \n[264]\t\t    I suppose. But they got here first, \t\t    the lousy bastards. So now it's all \t\t    over, I guess.  \n[265]\t\t    You'll have me, after all I've done \t\t    to you?  \n[266]\t\t    I'm through with puppets, Lotte. \t\t    I just want you to know that.  \n[267]\t\t    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to \t\t    help things grow, to encourage life. \t\t    Do you and your friends need a farmer?  \n[268]\t\t    I love you, Lotte.  \tWe come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put \tit around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament. \tWe follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a \tmarionette being controlled from above by an emotionless \tMantini in a gray jumpsuit.
