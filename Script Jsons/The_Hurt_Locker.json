A real tough little bastard. Like me. \n[138]Well, she was my girlfriend, we had a baby, then she became my wife, then we got divorced.  I thought we got divorced. But she's still in the house, and she says we're still together. \n[139]So, I don't know. What does that make her? \n[140]She ain't dumb. She's loyal. \n[141] \n[142]Bomb parts. \n[143]This is from the Blue Opal. (to himself) It's wild, isn't it, to hold something in your hands that could have killed you.

Well, why not. \n[166]I'm going back to sleep now. \n[167]Yeah. \n[168]Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege. \n[169]Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin. \n[170]You been inside already? \n[171]\n[172]Why don't you wait here? We'll bring out anything of interest. \n[173]Yeah, with like twenty pounds of high explosives on it so you get anyone in the room when you open the door. \n[174]Guess no one's home. \n[175] \n[176]The kid at camp. \n[177]He sells DVDs. \n[178]You see him every day. He sells DVDs by the mess tent. His name is Pele. \n[179]Don't touch it. Let's blow it. \n[180]     \n[181] \n[182] \n[183] \n[184] \n[185] \n[186]  \n[187] \n[188]   \n[189]Our ride is here. \n[190]We're movin'. \n[191]Hey - you haven't seen that kid around here by any chance - who sells movies? \n[192]No English? Don't lie to me. Where's that kid? \n[193]Are you guys responsible for this area? \n[194]That motherfucker over there could be an insurgent, watching the camp and giving intel to his buddies so they know where to launch their mortars. \n[195]He's a security risk. You should get rid of him. \n[196]Does this change anything? \n[197]\n[198]Don't fuck with me man, I'm having a bad day already. \n[199]Wait here. \n[200]Do you speak English? \n[201] \n[202]Pele. The body bomb. \n[203]Take me to the people responsible. \n[204]Maybe you don't understand? \n[205] \n[206]Whorehouse two clicks from here. \n[207] \n[208] \n[209]I didn't. Sergeant. Let's go. \n[210]Watch the road, Owen. \n[211]Sanborn, get the big spotlights. \n[212]No, we're EOD. \n[213]Oil tanker? \n[214]Sorry, Sir. I didn't recognize you. \n[215]We'll take a close look, Sir. \n[216]Roger that, Sir. We'll do our best. \n[217]Roger, Sir. We better get moving. \n[218]  \n[219]Hey! Hey -- you alright? -- Keef Halek? \n[220]Hey, I'm right here. \n[221]This is where the blast stopped. Look over there. \n[222]Perfect vantage point for a remote det -- and I bet he's out there right now watching us make fools of ourselves. We could get him. \n[223]Yeah, let's go hunting. \n[224]No? \n[225] \n[226] \n[227]You got to work on your pull ups. \n[228]That little bastard. Let's torch this spot so he can't use it again. \n[229]Do you have an incendiary? \n[230]Eldridge!!! \n[231]This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots. \n[232]Another guy comes from behind him -- gets the drop on him. You're a hostage. \n[233]Hit `em with both lights on three. \n[234]One. Two. \n[235]Three. \n[236]Again. One two three. Do it. Do it. \n[237]No. You're fine. \n[238]Fine. I'm fine. \n[239]Yeah. Thanks. I'm just tired. \n[240]Nah, I'm good. \n[241]You'll probably be walking in a few months. \n[242]Wow. Six ain't bad. \n[243]I'm sorry. \n[244]     \n[245] \n[246] \n[247] \n[248]What's going on? \n[249]We'll follow you. \n[250] \n[251] \n[252] \n[253]You don't need to. I'm going down there. \n[254] \n[255]Where's that helmet? \n[256]That's why it's called a suicide bomb. \n[257]Nah. That guy wants to catch an American? I'll give him an American. \n[258]Uh-huh. \n[259]If I shoot you now, I can disarm this bomb much more easily. Do you understand? \n[260] \n[261] \n[262]  \n[263] \n[264] \n[265] \n[266] \n[267] \n[268] \n[269]Nope. \n[270] \n[271]Motherfucker. What's our time? \n[272]Shit. Ok. Let me think. \n[273]We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly. \n[274]Let's try the back of it. \n[275]Go. I got the suit. \n[276]Take it with you, that's a good pistol. \n[277]In forty five seconds. \n[278]I'm sorry. \n[279]The metal is too thick. \n[280]Sorry. \n[281]    \n[282]        \n[283]You alright? \n[284]Have a hit. \n[285]Bro, you're not going to die out here. \n[286]You got time. \n[287]Hell, I don't know. \n[288]Yeah.  I do. But I don't know why. Do you know why I am the way I am? \n[289]This traffic is pissing me off. \n[290]I know where I am but I'm lost. \n[291]          \n[292]  \n[293]Yeah, okay.  You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there. \n[294]Uh-huh. \n[295]   \n[296]  \n[297]  \n[298]I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you? \n[299]We just did, buddy. \n[300]      \n[301](trying to settle him \n[302]Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there were many magic \n[303]Every person had a magic box. But you couldn't tell they were magic boxes on the outside. Like this one. \n[304]It just looks like a plain old box. Then a new king came along and told all the people, you have to give me all your magic boxes. But the people, instead of giving away their boxes decided to hide them. And they put their boxes in secret places all over the kingdom. They put them in the roads. They put them in cars. They put them in buildings. And the King said, (does a King's gravelly baritone) \"Well, how am I going to get my magic boxes now?\" And one of the King's men said, \"We have a special Knight with special armor, and he can find the boxes. And only he. \n[305]And this Knight gathered up all the boxes, far and wide. And sometimes - - when he wasn't sure if it was a magic box -- he opened them. \n[306]And the King said to the Knight, you have done a wonderful job. I will grant you one wish. What do you wish? \n[307]But the Knight didn't know what to say. \n[308]You see, the thing is, son. One day you'll understand that when you start out like you are now, you love everything. You love your Mommy and your Daddy. You love your bobba. You love your blanket. \n[309]You even love your little crib, and these dumb toys. But as you get older some of the things you love don't seem special anymore. That bobba is one day just going to look like an ordinary plastic bottle to you. And the older you get, the more this happens and the fewer things you love. And by the time you get to be my age, sometimes you only love one -- or two -- things. \n[310]With me, I think's it's one. \n[311]You lost again, Sergeant? \n[312]Your welcome, m'am.
