Sorry. \n[2]Waiting. \n[3]For the wheel to turn. \n[4]Is everything all right? \n[5]Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your building. \n[6]Good day. \n[7]    \n[8]...sorry? \n[9]What clan are you from? \n[10]You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never make such a mistake. \n[11]   \n[12]You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you -- \n[13]They'll put you in the box. \n[14]Trees don't have hearts. \n[15]I don't. \n[16]Liar. \n[17]    \n[18]         \n[19]       \n[20]Pleasure. \n[21]You know me? \n[22]How? \n[23]You know about them?                                   * \n[24]Nine.                                               * \n[25]His name was Jin.                                   * \n[26]He was not born an \"Assassin\".                      * \n[27]The clans have three kinds of                       * people! People with power.                          * People with money. Or people                        * hunting them.                                       * \n[28]They're coming. \n[29]The Hanta-Kirra. \n[30]They won't stop until you are                         * dead.                                                 * \n[31]The gun won't help you. \n[32]I can help but you must tell me                       * something first. \n[33]You saw Ms. Sabatin.                                  * \n[34]I've been watching you, waiting                       * for them.                                             * \n[35]Did she give you something?                          * \n[36]You have them? \n[37]We need something black. Hurry!                      * \n[38]Follow me.    Step where I step. \n[39]Not now.   Just drive. \n[40]Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention. \n[41]I know they're following us. \n[42]They have our scent. \n[43]No. Like Wolves. \n[44]I was one of them. \n[45]...something. \n[46]I know. \n[47]Raizo...is the name I was given. \n[48]Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop them. \n[49]Exit here. \n[50]You are a size 36? \n[51]If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you. \n[52]Do you understand that? \n[53]We need a hotel. \n[54]Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke? \n[55]Put your clothes in here. \n[56]What? \n[57]I'm trying to save your life. \n[58]Dry yourself with this. \n[59]Get dressed. \n[60]You said 34. \n[61]Let's go. \n[62]Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of. \n[63]Just borrow it. \n[64]Get in. \n[65]At ninja school I minored in electrical engineering. \n[66]Now we have some time. \n[67]A day.    Maybe less. \n[68]Make your call. \n[69]Why have you done this? \n[70]People will die. \n[71]The clans have people everywhere. \n[72]You shouldn't do that they'll catch you. \n[73]They'll put you in the box. \n[74]I told you.   I tried to warn you. \n[75]But you did it anyway.   Why? \n[76]I know. \n[77]The only time you lied to me was when you told me your size. \n[78]Your heart.   It is special. \n[79]Hearts speak truer than tongues. \n[80]It's too late. All that matters is the Rihla. Get the manuscript before they get here. \n[81]Hurry. \n[82]Mika! \n[83]You've got to get out of here! \n[84]Then we all die together. \n[85]Mika? \n[86]I don't want to sound critical-- \n[87]Go. Find Maslow. \n[88]Go quick. \n[89]...waiting for you... \n[90]No. Not a hospital.     Another place. \n[91]...dong-xia leaves...three of the lo-chan...dragon root... \n[92]No...it will save me.... \n[93]Hot water. \n[94]I have to sleep now...a day at least. \n[95]...keep moving... \n[96]...no! \n[97]Kiriko!   You can't leave! \n[98]Why? \n[99]The Hanta Kirra will come for you. \n[100]You know the law. He will cut your heart from your chest. \n[101]Where? What is out there? \n[102]...My life is here. \n[103]Why are you doing this? \n[104]What took you? \n[105]Just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you. \n[106]And I forgive you. \n[107]The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life. \n[108]Mika! Run! \n[109]Get away! \n[110]She saved my life. \n[111]She will be all right. \n[112]Her heart is special. \n[113]You shouldn't do that. \n[114]I don't.

Not again.                                  * \n[5]Does that evidence include photos                    * of the Loch Ness monster as well?                    * \n[6]What's the problem? Come on Mika,                    * it's like one of those questions                     * on an IQ test, which of these                        * doesn't belong; laptops, space                       * shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.                    * \n[7]Why do I think I'm going to regret                   * this?                                                * \n[8]You're excited, Mika. You know I get nervous when you're excited. \n[9]Korean queen, late eighteen-                         * hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans. \n[10]So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant. \n[11]Highly circumstantial.                               * \n[12]Let me guess. \n[13]Okay you got me. This is                                * interesting.                                            * \n[14]Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas. \n[15]And two cokes, please. \n[16]Course I can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying. \n[17]Not the way I was raised. My dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire. \n[18]For justice. And doughnuts. \n[19]So you got something else? \n[20]How do you know what the police report says? You're not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are you? \n[21]Good. \n[22]Denied.    It was a long shot at best. \n[23]A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped me to it. \n[24]It was written during the height of the Cold War by a high ranking KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin. In it, he raises the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the Nine Clans. \n[25]Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas. \n[26]Same thing that's going to happen to me, if I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental instability. \n[27]Working on it. \n[28]Ninjas?    Are you kidding? \n[29]No idea- \n[30]But I can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that I've ever worked with. \n[31]Last night I'm working late and I get a visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing. Asks what I'm working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell him. Then he smiles and says- \n[32]  \n[33]I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one. \n[34]Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them. \n[35]We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got it? \n[36]Yeah...he's dead. \n[37]Heart attack. \n[38]People die of heart attacks, Mika. \n[39]God, you are relentless, aren't you. \n[40]A wife. \n[41]Relocated. \n[42]Explain something to me first. Where is this obsession coming from? What started this whole thing? \n[43]Desire for what? \n[44]Mika! Tip-toe! \n[45]You lied to me. \n[46]I told you to stop using my confirmation code. \n[47]Dammit, Mika --                                    * \n[48]Shit.... \n[49]What happened? Everything's fucking happened. \n[50]When you were slapping my code all over town like some phone number in a bathroom, did you happen to notice the classification code on the cases you were digging through? \n[51]What did it say? \n[52]That's right. DNP. DO NOT \n[53]  \n[54]Right now there are people from internal affairs, CIA, Homeland Security and for all I know the Martian Fucking Military in my office tearing the place apart. \n[55]I don't know what they're looking for but I think you do. \n[56]And this? \n[57]...Christ. \n[58]So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now. \n[59]Okay, that's low. \n[60]Very noble of you but I've got the feeling this isn't a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. Capiche? \n[61]This is Ryan Maslow. Leave a number- \n[62]Ssssshhhhhh.   Sorry, Mika. \n[63]I couldn't talk earlier.   They're watching me. \n[64]I know how Sabatin must have felt. \n[65]I showed Jamison the materials. \n[66]I understand that sir but- \n[67]Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it. \n[68]Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday. \n[69]Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me. \n[70]I'm not talking about my job, Mika. \n[71]Take this. It's clean, no serial number. Untraceable. \n[72]This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell. \n[73]I'm going to try to find some help. Until then, I need you gone. Don't tell anyone where you're going, just go. Use this phone to text me when you get there, or if you have any problems. \n[74]I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking unbelievable! \n[75] \n[76]Mika! For Christ sake I've been calling for hours! \n[77]Trouble? You miss jury duty you're in trouble. You're in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit. \n[78]Your guardian angel? Is it him? The one from the tape? \n[79]Careful, Mika. \n[80]...yeah, I got them. \n[81]Where? \n[82]Mika! \n[83]You're all right? \n[84]Step back Mika. \n[85]\n[86]Following orders. \n[87]Right. \n[88]Something's wrong with the infrared cam. \n[89]Then why isn't he showing up? \n[90]Or maybe he's just cold-blooded. \n[91]It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid. \n[92]I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him first. \n[93]We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies. \n[94]No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I'm getting the feeling I'm looking at a pretty serious case of it. \n[95]He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him. \n[96]You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute. \n[97]Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings inside. \n[98]I believe you. I believe you. I've been in this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful how we handle this. And I can't risk you going AWOL on me again, because -- -- because I don't want anything to happen to you. \n[99]If trouble comes, turn this on, no matter where, and I'll find you. \n[100]We have to do this again, Coretti? \n[101]I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right? \n[102]See? \n[103]I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time. \n[104]They're not here now. \n[105]How soon- \n[106]Mika! \n[107]Go with her! Secure the prisoner! \n[108]Mika! \n[109]I thought you were-- \n[110]I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna need that soon. \n[111]What? \n[112]No Mika-- \n[113]Right... \n[114]Two minutes.    Keep it in gear. \n[115]Good, stay clear. \n[116]Not yet.   We're heading upstairs now. \n[117]He took off.   We think they went after him. \n[118]Mika, where are you? \n[119]He's still alive? \n[120]Let us bring you in. \n[121]Mika, the situation's a little different. Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked. \n[122]...negative. They got to my office. Everything's gone. \n[123]Mika, it's gonna be all right. We'll find them. \n[124]We'll keep your promise. They're too many people involved now. It's just a matter of time. \n[125]Just tell me where you are. \n[126]Mika? Mika? Dammit. \n[127]  \n[128]You've got a lock? \n[129]No more grenades, not until we get the children out! \n[130]Mika! \n[131]What happened? \n[132]How can you be sure? \n[133]Is she going to be okay? \n[134]...you gotta be fucking kidding me. \n[135]He said you saved his life. \n[136]So you kept your promise. Can we go home now? ", "Mika": "\n[1]No.    This is Delgata-                               * \n[2]...evidence.                                          * \n[3]You said you'd take it serious                        * when I had serious evidence.                          * \n[4]You've trusted my research before,                   * what's the problem now Ryan?                         * \n[5]All I'm asking for is an hour.                       * That's all. Give me an hour and                      * if you still think I'm chasing                       * UFO's, I'll walk out and you'll                      * never hear another thing about                       * them.                                                * \n[6]It's a pattern, like the currents of the ocean. \n[7]Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money. \n[8]You remember the Eulmi incident?                    * \n[9]Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda. \n[10]Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot. \n[11]I started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile assassinations and bingo- \n[12]Minister Zhang. The day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai. The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold. \n[13]I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years. \n[14]Not once. \n[15]The clans are real, Ryan. They                          * steal children and turn them into                       * assassins. They've been doing it                        * for years and nobody's doing a                          * damn thing to stop them.                                * \n[16]They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them. \n[17]How long have you been here? And you can't say \"zwei cola bitte\"? \n[18]Do you ever stop being a cop? \n[19]Desire? \n[20]I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying. \n[21]What about the bank audit? \n[22]But you said you found something. \n[23]What happened to him? \n[24]Is he still alive?    We need to find him. \n[25]You believe it now, don't you? \n[26]Then why are you doing this? \n[27]    \n[28]      \n[29]...who are you? \n[30]       \n[31]Excuse me? Excuse me? \n[32]Where's Jona? \n[33]Jona.    The usual cleaner. Jona. \n[34]Oh. Well, tell him I hope he feels better \n[35]...What? \n[36]True...Thanks. \n[37]...is someone there? \n[38]But why? \n[39]What are you going to do? \n[40]Did you find Sabatin yet? \n[41]You did. \n[42]How? \n[43]They killed him. \n[44]Was he married? Did he have a family? \n[45]I know you Ryan, you would have checked. \n[46]Still in Russia? \n[47]Where? \n[48]Like your father said...It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire. \n[49]For the truth. \n[50]Potsdam. She's in Berlin. \n[51]Mrs. Sabatin? \n[52]I'm with Europol. We spoke on the phone. \n[53]Shoen. \n[54]I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript. \n[55]I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the \n[56]What happened? \n[57]Do you know what they talked about? \n[58]Can I ask how he died? \n[59]      \n[60]What're you -- \n[61]I did -- \n[62]...I'm sorry, it was the only way                    * I could get the evidence.                            * \n[63]What happened? \n[64]\n[65] \n[66]Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty. \n[67]That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that. \n[68]Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war. \n[69]I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in trouble... \n[70]I just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them. \n[71]Isn't that what your dad would do? \n[72]Look, I know I broke the rules. I'll explain what I did and accept the consequences. \n[73]     \n[74]Excuse me? Who are you? \n[75]...A few cases. \n[76]What? \n[77]How do you know that? \n[78]I...I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working- \n[79]No...not right now. \n[80]No why. Has Agent Maslow done something? \n[81]Come on...you're kidding me. \n[82]Fucking Christ, Ryan- \n[83]Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you. \n[84]What happened? \n[85]What did he say? \n[86]He took the materials? \n[87]What are we going to do? \n[88]No way- \n[89]Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me- \n[90]I've never even fired one of these. \n[91]Ryan... \n[92]   \n[93]Hey.... \n[94]What happened? \n[95]You're not the first person to give me that advice today.... \n[96]   \n[97]           \n[98]...security camera in New York.                        * Recorded you fighting...one of                         * them.                                                  * \n[99]A little.                                              * \n[100]Uhh-- Well, there are these                         * clans...we're not sure how many.                    * \n[101]Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And                         * they apparently have been                           * supplying assassins to governments                  * or anyone who happens to have one                   * hundred pounds of gold lying                        * around for the last thousand                        * years. Give or take.                                * \n[102]You knew him?                                       * \n[103]...you're from his clan ?                           * \n[104]Then...why did you stop him?                        * \n[105]Who? \n[106]Does that mean what I think it means? \n[107]Oh god.                                               * \n[108]I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities. \n[109]What? \n[110]How did you know that?                                * \n[111]But I can get them. \n[112]       \n[113]     \n[114]I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript. \n[115]Where? \n[116]You think they're following us? \n[117]I don't see anything back there. \n[118]Following our scent?    Like dogs? \n[119]How do you know so much about them? \n[120]You flunked out of ninja school or something? \n[121]Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk. \n[122]My name is Mika by the way. \n[123]Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise. \n[124]So, you were an orphan? \n[125]Interesting nature verses nurture case study I imagine. \n[126]If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know. \n[127]Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm pretty lethal with the research thing. \n[128]But here's a question I can't answer: since you didn't know I went to Sabatin's, why did you save me? \n[129]I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late. \n[130]What? No! Size 34...`cept certain times of the month. \n[131]No. \n[132]Hey- \n[133]Don't you know how to knock? \n[134]...okay right. \n[135]...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this... \n[136]These are a little tight. \n[137]European sizes...run a little small I guess. \n[138]This is for my \"scent\"? \n[139]Wow. They teach you that at ninja school? \n[140]You're going to steal a car? \n[141]In for a penny, in for a pounding. \n[142]How much time? \n[143]Jesus. \n[144]Ryan, it's me. \n[145]I know.   I'm in a bit of trouble- \n[146]Yeah. Least I'm not down here by myself... \n[147]He's on our side, Ryan.   I trust him. \n[148]I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still have them? \n[149]Can you meet us? In three hours? \n[150]How bout the usual? \n[151]There he is. \n[152]He's a good man. It's all right. \n[153]Thanks to him. \n[154]Done what? \n[155]What? \n[156]No! \n[157]Raizo!   No!   This is wrong! \n[158]What are you doing? \n[159]Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo? \n[160]Ryan you're making a huge mistake! \n[161]So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one? \n[162]He's not the enemy. \n[163]I'm not crazy.     This is! \n[164]You're not listening to me! \n[165]Damn it, Ryan, I -- \n[166]They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years. \n[167]Could you give us a moment? \n[168]If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago. \n[169]Hi...you looked thirsty. \n[170]I'm sorry...I didn't know about this. \n[171]You do? \n[172]How did you know that? \n[173]You know about my heart? \n[174]Listen, Maslow is on our side. He's going to try to help you. \n[175]The Hanta Kirra? \n[176]Ryan, can I talk to you? \n[177]No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here. \n[178]But the situation we discussed- \n[179]We don't have time. \n[180]They'll be here soon. \n[181]Raizo-- \n[182]I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner. \n[183]Not without you. \n[184]Fuck me... \n[185]Come on--come on-- \n[186]Shh! \n[187]Got it! \n[188]Jesus Ryan-- \n[189]Are you ok? \n[190]Come on. \n[191]Fuck! \n[192]The manuscript-- \n[193]Maslow-- \n[194]Tip-toe. \n[195]Come on, Ryan... \n[196]Hurry the fuck up! \n[197]Motherfuckfuckfuck-- \n[198]Ryan- I had to leave! \n[199]Do you have the map? \n[200]Where's Raizo \n[201]Raizo! \n[202]What were you doing in the street?! \n[203]You have to go to a hospital. \n[204]A day?!?     What should I do? \n[205]I'll have him to go. Can you...help me to the car? \n[206]Moving.   He told me to keep moving. \n[207]After a fashion. \n[208]Not this time. \n[209]Do you have the manuscript? \n[210]...but I promised... \n[211]I don't think we have much time... \n[212]I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway. \n[213]I'm a forensic researcher, okay? That's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian. By myself I can't do anything to help you. \n[214]I wanted to think you for saving my life. \n[215]And I hope you can forgive me for this. \n[216]They took him.     Ten minutes ago. He's gone. \n[217]You knew I'd come? \n[218]Die you fuck! \n[219]Raizo \n[220]Where is he?   I can't see him! \n[221]Medic!
