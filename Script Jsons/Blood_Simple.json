Where was he last night? \n[9]I don't know, didn't he call? \n[10]...Marty, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Debra. Debra, this is Julian Marty, the dude I'm always talking about. \n[11]You said the usual-- \n[12] \n[13]What. \n[14]Right. \n[15]What. \n[16]Right. \n[17]What. \n[18]Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it. \n[19]What's the point? \n[20]Where? ...I'm very careful about that. \n[21]Not really. What'd you say your last name was? \n[22]Howdy stranger. \n[23]Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea... \n[24]...Ray, this is Debra. She's a geologist.

You broke in the bar and ripped off the safe... \n[47]...Abby warned me you were gonna make trouble. Trouble with you is, you're too fucking obvious; the only ones with the combination are me and you... \n[48]...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility. \n[49]Those things are nothing but coffin nails. \n[50]...Look. Personally I don't give a shit. I know Marty's a hard-on but you gotta do something. I don't know; give the money back, say you're sorry, or get the fuck out of here, or something... \n[51]...It's very humiliating, preaching about this shit. \n[52]I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, so you know it's no fucking joke. \n[53] \n[54]Abby.

No, no, that's not what's funny. What's funny is her. What's funny is that I had you two followed because, if it isn't you, she's been sleeping with someone else... \n[49]...What's really going to be funny is when she gives you that innocent look and says, What're you talking about, Ray, I haven't done anything funny... \n[50]...But the funniest thing to me right now is that you think she came back here for you--*that's* what's funny. \n[51]...Come on this property again and I'll be forced to shoot you... \n[52]...Fair notice. \n[53] \n[54]No. I think I'll stay right here in hell. \n[55]Meurice... \n[56]...I don't want that asshole near my money.
