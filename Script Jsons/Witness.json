We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore. \n[10]We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where is that train, please? \n[11]  \n[12]What do you want of my son? \n[13]Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. \n[14]May I talk to you? \n[15]Zwartich. It's the way we say... dwarf. Not like him... very big. \n[16]  \n[17](reassuring, but hardly in her own mind \n[18]Where are you taking us? \n[19]You have no right to keep us here. \n[20]You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! \n[21]It's not a joke. \n[22]He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. \n[23]John Book, you listen to me! I will have no further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us! \n[24]No! We do not stay in hotels. \n[25]  \n[26]  \n[27]Yes, thank you very much. \n[28]Yes. \n[29]They are English. They don't understand. \n[30] \n[31]  \n[32]  \n[33]Good morning. \n[34]I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish! \n[35]Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee. \n[36]  \n[37]Please, I didn't mean... \n[38]I brought your coffee. \n[39]I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. \n[40]Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. \n[41]At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. \n[42]You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. \n[43]Okay. \n[44]The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. \n[45] \n[46]We do not go into your courts. \n[47]    \n[48] \n[49]He says you look very tired. I thought the same thing. \n[50]But not a good tired. \n[51]Your sister said you don't have a family? \n[52]She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility. \n[53]Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. \n[54]I think that's what she said. \n[55]Good appetite. \n[56]Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? \n[57]But why would they murder... \n[58] \n[59]Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other! \n[60]Where are you taking us now? \n[61]You couldn't wait until morning? \n[62] \n[63]You said we would be safe in Philadelphia. \n[64]Kinner un Narre... [\"Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret\" \u0096 \"Children and fools say the truth\" \u0096 Amish expressions] \n[65]Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. \n[66]What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? \n[67]His name is John Book. \n[68]  \n[69]But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? \n[70] \n[71]But \u0096 \n[72]No... \n[73]I know. \n[74]It will go when he goes. \n[75]Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus. \n[76]Go help Levi with the car, Samuel. \n[77]No, he must stay here. \n[78]We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! \n[79]I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. \n[80]What else can we do? \n[81]  \n[82]Thank you. \n[83]It's all right! You have got to lie still. \n[84] \n[85]Hello. \n[86]The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life. \n[87]Only the elders. \n[88]What? \n[89]Two days. \n[90] \n[91]See. Anyway, you don't have any clothes on. And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better. \n[92] \n[93] \n[94]He'll leave as soon as he is able. He already wants to go. \n[95] \n[96]Wait for me downstairs. \n[97]John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible. \n[98]It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel. \n[99]Please, it has nothing to do with you personally. \n[100]Enjoying your reading? \n[101]Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these. \n[102]Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers. \n[103]I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes. \n[104]Buttons are Hochmut. \n[105]Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. \n[106] \n[107]Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. \n[108]Well... the store at Saltzburg... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while. \n[109]But Stoltzfus said... \n[110]You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry. \n[111]You'd better go. \n[112]Oh. The bullets. \n[113]   \n[114]Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago. \n[115]We had some lemonade and he left. \n[116]You know carpentry? \n[117]What else can you do? \n[118]Whacking is not of much use on a farm. \n[119]I'm sorry. I'm sure it is. \n[120]Tonight I'll let out those trousers for you. \n[121]Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman. \n[122]But... You may not be well enough. \n[123] \n[124]No... You just stop \u0096 \n[125]I have done nothing against the ordnung. \n[126]I have committed no sin. \n[127]That is idle talk. \n[128]I am not a child. \n[129]I will be the judge of that. \n[130](blinking a tear now, but meeting his gaze \n[131] \n[132]I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's. \n[133]Good luck. \n[134]All of them charitable, I'm sure. \n[135]  \n[136]Samuel, who is that? \n[137]Do nothing. This happens from time to time. \n[138]It's not our way, John. We'll have nothing to do with violence! John! \n[139] \n[140]John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. \n[141]Yes. Samuel! We're going. \n[142]You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow. \n[143]There was a time when I thought you might have stayed. \n[144]There was a time when I would have welcomed it. \n[145] \n[146]You're so sure of that? \n[147](almost conceding it, but... her voice rising a bit, annoyed  \n[148]There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land! \n[149]What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven! \n[150]That's God's way! \n[151]I could never love a man who was so... little. \n[152]The other night... when you saw me after my bath... I... I tried to look as I thought you would want a woman to look. I am sorry... that I did not. \n[153]  \n[154]Eli, would you see Samuel to bed? \n[155] \n[156]You have no right here! \n[157]You might have killed him! \n[158]My son is out there! \n[159]  \n[160]  \n[161]I have to help him! \n[162]I want you to take this... to remember by. \n[163]Here. Whenever you want them. ", "Stoltzfus": "\n[1]Lapp was a good farmer. None better. \n[2]That's the English is it? \n[3]I feel... burning. \n[4]This man should be treated in town.

But there is the danger of infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood. \n[5]Make a poultice... three parts milk, two parts linseed oil... for the infection. \n[6]Lapp, I'll have to speak with the diener on this matter. \n[7]He was touched by God's hand. \n[8]Rest, Mr. Book.

We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political.

They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops. \n[63]You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. \n[64]Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an I.D.

He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. \n[69]Just us. \n[70]More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off.
