'Cause this way all he gets out of it is the ride. Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful? Ain't they just plain awful? Question to you: if somebody told him he was a sucker, do you think he'd quit? \n[12]What I need is some sleep. Shut up! \n[13]Since you won't let me sleep you might at least give me a drink. \n[14] \n[15] \n[16] \n[17]That you're not going to be governor. \n[18] \n[19]And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead decoy! And you let 'em. You let 'em because you thought you were the little lamb of God. But you know what you are? Well, you're the goat! You are the sacrificial goat! You are a sap... because you let 'em. \n[20]Enough? He didn't even get anything out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you to take a rap like that, but they didn't have to pay a sap like you.

He's going to do big things, this fella. He's going to be President. He's going to kill people with his bare hands. I quieted him down... Hey! Who's Lucy? \n[28]He talks like she's his mammy... she's going to blow his nose for him. \n[29]Yeah, well give me a receipt for the body and I'll be on my way. \n[30] \n[31]Whoops! \n[32] \n[33]Hair? He must have swallowed the dog. \n[34] \n[35]What's he up to? \n[36] \n[37]Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy? Take that downstairs; they're waiting for it. Right away, on the double. Listen, baby, you've got to double- space all of this... he can't read, see. \n[38]  \n[39]Fix your tie, Willie. \n[40]Yeah. We need a college man around... for research. \n[41] \n[42]I'll kill him. \n[43]I'll kill him. \n[44]I hate all women. \n[45]Was she pretty? \n[46]Was she pretty? \n[47]Was she pretty? \n[48]Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive him out of this state. \n[49]Public or private... I know him. How about what happened in Chicago? That girl on skates... and the time you both went to St. Louis... There's a new invention, you know, Photography and newsreels. Willie Stark in a nightclub... Willie Stark with a blonde. \n[50]I could also break every bone in his neck. After all I've done for him... Now he goes two-timing me. \n[51]Lucy? If she had her way he'd be back in Kanoma City slopping the hogs right now. And he knows it. He knows what she'd do for him. She had her chance. \n[52]He'll ditch her... Give him time. \n[53]We're late. \n[54]Yeah?... Oh, I see. Dumond can't come. He says his wife is sick. \n[55]Yes? This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the wire. \n[56]No. No, I don't. \n[57]Good evening, Governor Stark. I thought you might like to know that Judge Stanton kept his promise. He gave the story to every paper in town. \n[58]Why? Because his name is Stanton? \n[59]It's me, Sadie Burke. \n[60]Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of whisky. You sober? \n[61]I'll have one with you. What are you hiding out for? \n[62]For four days? You've been back in town for four days. \n[63]Willie's worried about his boy. \n[64]Well, why don't you put something on the phonograph -- a low-down, mean blues. Play it over and over again until you're sick of it. Then crack it and go back to work. I do it all the time. \n[65]No, it isn't your problem. I'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose. \n[66]Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got to look in the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin... not like mine. I had smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox... \n[67]It leaves your face hard. Then she's got poise. Look at the way she holds her head... at just the right angle. That takes training. That takes years of training... \n[68]I see what Willie sees. Willie's got big ideas, Jack. \n[69]A girl like that could be a governor's wife. Or even a President's. \n[70]He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and he'll ditch you. \n[71]He'll ditch everybody in the whole world because that's what Willie wants. Nobody in the world but him. \n[72]You and your high-tone friends. What do they know? What do they know about anything? Why did you have to mix her in? \n[73]Am I? Well, why don't you go down and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie. \n[74]Go ahead, ask him. \n[75]Ask him! \n[76]Ow-oo... oh... oh. \n[77]I'll help. \n[78](starting toward the door \n[79]Somebody's got to go back to the capital.

It was too easy then, just resigning, pulling out. No, Jack, I've made my choice. I have nothing more to lose. \n[22]Yes, it's true. \n[23]Well, you've heard it.

I'd like to meet this Willie Stark. He sounds like an honest man. \n[3]I have a question. \n[4]A lot of people in this state have been saying that you've been making deals... some of them with the very groups that you claim you're against. Is that true? \n[5]You're sure about that? \n[6]Shoot. \n[7]You tell me, Mr. Stark. \n[8]No, I didn't... There's another question I'd like to ask you.

Why do you think he wants me? \n[23]It could have nothing to do with my name being Stanton? \n[24]That's your answer. \n[25]Or heads. \n[26]At what price? \n[27]Do you really believe that, Jack? \n[28]Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil. \n[29]How would they know? The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me. \n[30]Anne... Anne... \n[31]I just got a call from Dr. Birnham. The earliest he can possibly get here will be tomorrow morning. \n[32]That's up to Governor Stark. He wanted another doctor... a specialist.

Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why... \n[2]...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own.

Last year, last year the state claimed to have spent on roads... \n[50](as he comes into the lobby \n[51]Thanks. \n[52]Now, friends, if you will bear patiently with me for a few minutes, I'll give you the figures.

There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech. \n[69]But I am going to tell you a story. It's a funny story... \n[70]...So get ready to laugh. \n[71]Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him. \n[72]No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor... \n[73]...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in. \n[74]There he is! There's your Judas Iscariot. Look at him... lickspittle... nose- wiper. \n[75] \n[76]Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy! Look at him! \n[77]Look at him! \n[78]Now, shut up! Shut up, all of you. Now, listen to me, you hicks. Yeah, you're hicks too, and they fooled you a thousand times, just like they fooled me. But this time I'm going to fool somebody. I'm going to stay in this race. I'm on my own and I'm out for blood. \n[79]Listen to me, you hicks... \n[80]Listen to me and lift up your eyes and look at God's blessed and unflyblown truth... And this is the truth. You're a hick. And nobody ever helped a hick but a hick himself. \n[81]All right, listen to me... listen to me. I was the hick they were going to use to split the hick vote. But I'm standing right here now on my hind legs... even a dog can learn to do that. Are you standing on your hind legs? Have you learned to do that much yet? Here it is, here it is, you hicks. Nail up anybody who stands in your way! Nail up Joe Harrison! Nail up McMurphy! And if they don't deliver, give me a hammer and I'll do it myself. \n[82]Double bourbon. \n[83]And a beer. I hear you got fired from the paper. \n[84](passing the beer back to Sugar Boy \n[85]I feel fine, fine.

Here it is: I'm going to soak the fat boys and I'm going to spread it thin. \n[92]This is Jack Burden, a friend of mine. From now on he's going to live here. Give him anything he wants. \n[93] \n[94]No. No, not yet. But I want to keep him around.

You too, Duffy. Go on. \n[100] \n[101]That's the object. Not like when they beat up my boy Tom. \n[102]Oh, he's fine. He starts college in the fall. \n[103]Fine... fine. \n[104]Sadie is my secretary now. Oh, pardon me. \n[105]Hey, Sugar. \n[106]Keep everybody out of here.

I'll give you four hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses. \n[112]Money?... I don't need money. People give me things. \n[113]Because they believe in me. \n[114]It's a far cry from where I come from... to this house. \n[115]And standing here under the portrait of one of the greatest governors of this state, talking to you people... well, it's an honor I never thought I'd have. \n[116]Shoot. \n[117]Yes. Yes, that's true. I have nothing to hide. I'll make a deal with the devil if it'll help me carry out my program. But believe me, there are no strings attached to those deals. \n[118]Doc, Jack here has been telling me how you feel about things... how you'd like to see a new hospital built, a hospital that's the biggest and best that money can buy. You want those things, Doc, because, well, because you're a man who wants to do good. Now, I'd like to ask you a question. \n[119]Do you know what good comes out of? \n[120]Out of bad... that's what good comes out of. Because you can't make it out of anything else. You didn't know that, did you? \n[121]Why not? \n[122]Why, that's easy. Just... just make it up as you go along. \n[123]Folks, there's a time to talk and there's a time to act. I think the time to act is right now. And with your support, I not only will win but I will do all of the things I promised. I need your help. Oh, I need it badly. But I'm not going to beg for it. In the name of this state which we love... in the name of the governor in whose house we meet... I demand it. \n[124] \n[125]But a game one. \n[126]Look, I'll give you complete power as attorney general. You can do anything you see fit. I'll swing the ax to clear the way for you. Is that a deal? \n[127]Jack, we have to get back to town... a lot to do. Dr. Stanton. \n[128] \n[129](raises his hands for silence \n[130]This much I swear to you. These things you shall have.

Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope... \n[131]I demand that this bill be passed.

Let's get him over to my hotel just as soon as you can. \n[137]Well, I'm very sorry. Something very important came up. You'll call me later, won't you? \n[138]Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact? \n[139]Answer me! \n[140]Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up. Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact. \n[141]I don't care if she's dying. Sugar, get the car. Get him and bring him over here. \n[142]Now, you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time... but Duffy'll take care of that. Don't you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you understand that? \n[143]Louder, man. And say, I understand that. \n[144]Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie. \n[145]See who that is, Duffy. \n[146]Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be with you in just a couple of seconds. Now write what I tell you to write... Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours. Did you sign it? \n[147] \n[148]Now bring it to me. \n[149]Now get out. \n[150]Yeah, I know. \n[151] \n[152]I got that \"this time,\" Judge. \n[153]It's too true. \n[154]What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury business... Here's what I want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You listen to me. You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you? All right, Tiny'll talk to you in the morning. \n[155]Get going, Tiny. \n[156]I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury's hide. It's something much more important than that. If the McMurphy boys get the notion they can get away with this, there's no telling where they'll stop. \n[157]Judge, you talk like Pillsbury was... was human. He isn't. He's a thing. You don't prosecute an adding machine if the spring goes busted and makes a mistake. You fix it. Well, I fixed him. I'm not a bit interested in Pillsbury. It's something much bigger than that. \n[158] \n[159]And now you are? \n[160]I'll tell you what you are. You're scared. You sat in that big easy chair of yours for thirty years and played at being a judge. Then all of a sudden I came along and put a bat in your hand, and I said, go ahead, Judge, start swinging. And you did. And you had a wonderful time. But now you're scared. You don't want to get your hands dirty. You want to pick up the marbles... but you don't want to get your hands dirty. Look at my whole program, Judge. How do you think I put that across? \n[161]You're not by any chance thinking of going over to McMurphy's boys, are you? \n[162]I'm happy to hear that. No hard feelings. \n[163]Do you think he means it when he says he's through with politics, Sadie? \n[164]What about you, Jack? \n[165]All right. All right. Take it easy. I'll take your word for it. \n[166]Sugar, take Miss Stanton home. When am I going to see you again? \n[167]What's the matter, Anne? \n[168]You've got to understand me. \n[169]Do you think I like sneaking around corners any more than you do? But right now, with the Pillsbury business and with your uncle quitting... If I got a divorce... \n[170]No. No, we won't stop seeing each other, will we? \n[171]Because you believe in what I tell you. \n[172]Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon as you can. \n[173]These things are never over. I'll tell you what I want you to do, Jack. I want you to start a new page in that black book of yours... under then name of Judge Stanton. \n[174]Ssshhh, easy. \n[175]You know, some of this has rubbed off on you. \n[176]No... no... but I'll have to get myself a new boy. \n[177]Jack, there's something on everybody. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. \n[178]What's the matter, Jack? Are you afraid you might find something out? \n[179]It's only practice. He'll be all right tomorrow... You been gone a long time, Jack. \n[180]Why'd you lay around the hotel? \n[181]About what? \n[182]What did you find on the Judge? \n[183]You sure you didn't find anything on the Judge? \n[184]You're going to keep trying, aren't you? \n[185]I want you to. There's something else I want you to do too. \n[186] \n[187]If you've got something on your mind, boy, spit it out. We've been together too long to play games. \n[188]I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned down the job as director of the hospital. That's bad. Especially at a time like this. \n[189]Why? What difference does it make? \n[190]I heard it around. \n[191]I'll be right back, Jack. I want to see what's happening here. \n[192]Tom, come here. What's going on here? \n[193]Well, it does to me. What do you want him to do? \n[194]Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules. Do you hear me? You're going to obey the rules. \n[195]Tom! He's a little high-strung. Tom, come here. Tom! \n[196]Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some business I want to talk over with Mr. Hale. \n[197]Now... now, don't get excited. Get me another drink, Sugar. \n[198]She's not going to die. She'll get the best medical attention there is. No expense will be spared. \n[199]Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep. And the doctor said after a good night's sleep he'll be all right. \n[200]Lucy! You care for a drink? \n[201]Accidents will happen, you know. \n[202]I saw the police report. There... there was nothing about drunkenness on the police report. \n[203]Tom, the doctor says you need rest, boy. \n[204]You don't know what you're talking about. I saw the police report -- \n[205]Nobody has to do anything. Stop worrying. I'll take care of everything. \n[206]Tom, go on upstairs and get some rest, boy. Go on... go on... go on. \n[207]Sugar, help him... Mr. Hale, come on over and sit down. You sure you wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale? \n[208]Hey, Tiny, go home. Go on, out of here... out of here. Go on. \n[209]What business did you say you were in? \n[210]What business are you in? \n[211]Trucking business. Trucks run on state roads. If a man in the trucking business had a contract with the state, a big one, that would be pretty good, wouldn't it? Go on, Jack. Tell him what would happen. \n[212]Go on, tell him. \n[213]No, no. No, I'm not trying to bribe you. I'm... I'm only talking things over with you, that's all. \n[214] \n[215] \n[216]All right, all right, gentlemen. I'll give you a statement. This whole thing is a mess of lies. It's a frame. The man that made that statement... have him repeat it to my face. He can't. He vanished. Let me ask you some questions. Where has he gone? Where is he? \n[217]I won't dignify that question with an answer. \n[218]At the football stadium, where he's supposed to be. He's going to play for State University, which this administration is responsible for. He's not hiding from anybody, gentlemen. He'll be out there in full view of seventy thousand cheering fans. One of which will be me. See you, men. \n[219]Why don't they put him in! \n[220]Get that man out of here! Come on, get him out of here. \n[221]They're booing you. \n[222]The doctor said it was nothing. \n[223]You're scared... plain scared. \n[224]Atta boy... get mad. Show some spirit. Jack, tell him what his playing means. Go on, tell him. \n[225]He's hurt? I'm hurt. It wasn't me that wrapped that car around the tree. It wasn't me that got drunk. But me, I'm takin' the rap. Go on, kid. Get out there and play. Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark is made of. \n[226]I'm the one that made him play. I sent him in. \n[227]I sent him in. \n[228]What goes on? \n[229]They gotta fly. This is my son. He's got to live. \n[230]Isn't there anybody else we can get? \n[231]How bad is it really, doctor? \n[232]Has he got a chance? \n[233]What do you mean? \n[234]You'll do everything you can, won't you? Anything between you and me.. that won't count, will it? It doesn't have to. Look, doc, anything you want in the world you just ask for it and you got it. Go on, doc... ask for it. \n[235] \n[236]Oh, you know what I'm talking about. \n[237]About Anne and me. \n[238] \n[239]Why? \n[240]To do some good for the people of the state. \n[241]Oh, there are lots of ways to get votes. \n[242]I won't interfere. I may fire you, but I won't interfere. \n[243]Yes, I know. I'll tell you what... You stay on your side of the fence; I'll stay on mine. Is that a deal? \n[244]  \n[245]How many theaters will this play in? \n[246]Hear that, Jack. All over the country. \n[247]Oh, there's one thing in there I didn't like too well. That messiah or dictator. \n[248]All right, all right, that's the way it stands... as of now. \n[249]Hello, Lucy... How are you making it, Pa?... How are you, Tom? \n[250]  (kisses Lucy on the forehead (extends his hand to Tom \n[251]Take care of yourself, Pappy. Oh, uh... how do you like the new radio I got you? You know how it works? You can get police calls on it. Come here, come here... I'll show you. \n[252]This one for police calls up here. \n[253]All right, go ahead, go ahead. \n[254] \n[255]How long will it take you to pack? I want you to go back to Capital City with me tonight. \n[256]Because I need you. \n[257](still speaking to Lucy \n[258]You stay right here, Jack. I want you bear witness to what I've got to say. \n[259]You stay right here, Sadie. \n[260]All right, then tell Duffy not to do anything or say anything until I get there. \n[261] \n[262]Leave him alone. How many scrapes have I gotten him out of? How many girls? \n[263]It's not him they're after. It's me. How many halfwitted apes do you think I'm going to have to pay to square this one? What do you think this is going to cost me? \n[264] \n[265]Give me a drink, Jack. \n[266]She'll go. \n[267] \n[268]How do you know? Were you there? \n[269]Selling me out. \n[270]How many votes have we got? \n[271]We need twenty. \n[272]Yeah. Do you know how? \n[273]Oh, Jack. Come here. What have you got in your black book about that old friend of yours? \n[274]You know who I'm talking about... your old friend, the Judge. \n[275]If and when? I need it right now. He's got four senators wrapped up in his hip pocket. Come on, come on, boy... what have you got? \n[276]I ought to bust you, Jack. \n[277]Who are they? \n[278]All right, give him a break. But if you got the facts, you got the facts. The truth is sufficient... just like it says in the Bible. \n[279]All right, boy... I'll trust you. Where are you going? \n[280] \n[281]Tell the boys to get the hicks out. Bring 'em in from the sticks, empty the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn the yokels out. \n[282]Boy, I'll live to be President... \n[283]I've got fourteen senators to vote against impeachment. If I win, you're out of politics. \n[284]You sure you don't want me to go in with you? \n[285]Well, hurry it up, boy. We've got places to go. \n[286]I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a very impatient man. \n[287] \n[288]I wanted to hear you say it with your own silver tongue. \n[289]Mind if I pour myself a drink? How about you, Judge, will you have one? You better... You're going to need it. \n[290]What'd he say, Jack? \n[291]Are you kidding? Did you show it to him, or didn't you? \n[292]That's what I figured. Let's get down to cases, Judge. Do you remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh? \n[293]Remember the Fortune Electric Company? \n[294]Remember how you got the job? \n[295](hands the Judge some papers \n[296]You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing. Some of it rubs off on everybody. How did you get the job, Judge? Blackmail? \n[297]Yeah. But it did. \n[298]Well, I guess you know what the next move is, don't you? \n[299]Everybody except you, Judge. You're alive. And people think you're a certain kind of man. And you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise. \n[300]Yes, yes, you did. \n[301]How about my answer? \n[302]I want it tonight. \n[303]We've got a lot to do. It's getting late, Jack. Let's get back to town. \n[304]Aw, you don't mean that, boy. \n[305]It's all right, doc. Just here to discuss some politics with the Judge. \n[306]Good night. \n[307]Wait a minute, Jack -- \n[308]      \n[309]    \n[310]They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done? \n[311]Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him. I'll break him with my bare hands. For I have the strength of many. \n[312]Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're here. I knew you'd come back. \n[313]Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see you. \n[314]It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark. The whole world... Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me... Willie Stark?

And Lucy? \n[127]Sadie! \n[128]Doing what? \n[129]Three hundred dollars a month. \n[130]For a bag of salt. \n[131]You throw money around like it was money. \n[132]Why? \n[133] \n[134]Are there any questions? Mr. McEvoy. \n[135]Judge? \n[136]Adam, you know how rumors start... \n[137]You've got to say yes. With you in the race... \n[138] \n[139] \n[140] \n[141] \n[142] \n[143] \n[144] \n[145] \n[146]Why, Sadie, I'm surprised at you. \n[147]If I met her on the street I'd never recognize her. \n[148]How should I know? I wasn't looking at her face... Look, if it's going to cause all this grief, why don't you let him go? \n[149]Just because a guy's sitting with a couple of girls on his knees in public... \n[150]You could always bleach your hair. \n[151]He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's another kind of arithmetic for what he's doing to you. \n[152]You seem to think Lucy's on her way out, don't you? \n[153]You ought to know. \n[154]Hey, you got the wrong guy. I'm not the hero of this piece. \n[155]He's right, Judge. Can't you see that he's right? \n[156]I've known the Judge all my life. He's always meant everything he's said. \n[157]But we beat the Pillsbury rap... It's over. \n[158]You're crazy. There's nothing on the Judge. \n[159]What if I won't do it? \n[160]What are you going to do? Have me shot? \n[161]I tell you there's nothing on the Judge. \n[162]It's a waste of time. \n[163] \n[164]Anne, I want to ask you a question. Was the Judge ever broke? Really broke? \n[165]I don't want to know, but I've got to. \n[166]Did who tell me? \n[167]Me, I'm on the thirsty side. Bring some glasses, Anne, quick. \n[168] \n[169]Shall we dance? \n[170]No, no... keep playing. Anne and I want to hear this, don't we, Anne? Adam... ghost... and me. \n[171]To the ghost?... To Adam, to the director of the new medical center. \n[172]I'm sorry, Adam. \n[173]Why? Because your uncle resigned? \n[174]Anne, if Adam doesn't want to discuss it, let's not. \n[175]Because you're the best man for the job. \n[176]It could have. Let's grant that. \n[177]No, it's not. If that were the only answer I wouldn't be with him any more. There's another side of it. I've learned something from him. You can't make an omelet without cracking eggs. \n[178]At any price. \n[179]I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good. Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that. \n[180]The people of the state don't think so. \n[181] \n[182] \n[183]Have some photostat copies made of these. I'll be back tomorrow for them. \n[184]Who is it? \n[185]Wait a minute. \n[186]All right, come in. \n[187]Stone. \n[188]I'm not. I've been sleeping. \n[189]Willie knows everything. \n[190]Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy. \n[191]That's not my problem. \n[192]I'll be with you in a minute. \n[193]What do you mean? \n[194]What are you talking about? \n[195] \n[196]What are you talking about? \n[197]You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of your mind. \n[198]Shut up! \n[199]Shut up! \n[200]He's off today. \n[201]Yeah. I figured if you needed me you'd yell. \n[202]Thinking. \n[203]Things. \n[204]Nothing. \n[205]Yeah, I'm sure. \n[206]If you want me to. \n[207]What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger? What? \n[208] \n[209]What do you want me to do? \n[210]Oh? How did you hear it? \n[211]I just wanted to know. \n[212] \n[213]I'd like Anne to see you now. I'd like Anne to see you now, you drunken sot! Come on. \n[214]You can never tell about a head injury. Maybe the boy's hurt. \n[215]Tom... cut it out! \n[216]There isn't a plane flying. \n[217]I still think Dr. Stanton should operate. \n[218]About what? \n[219]About what? \n[220] \n[221]The boy? \n[222]He'll live. \n[223]Willie? \n[224](as he walks down the street \n[225]Anne... Anne, why did you do it? \n[226]You mean he wasn't like me. \n[227]Everybody loves him. \n[228]Are you going to? \n[229]His career! \n[230]What Willie needs, Willie's got. \n[231]What about Adam? \n[232]Well, you don't have to worry about him. If Adam finds out it'll be easy to prove a Stanton is no different than anybody else. Just show him these. Willie was right... a man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. Even Judge Stanton. Show them to him, Anne. Change the picture of the world that Adam has in his head, just like our picture of it has been changed. \n[233]Wipe out everything he's ever believed in. It'll be good for him. There's no God but Willie Stark. I'm his prophet and you're his... Oh, Anne... Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Anne! \n[234]It's all right, officer... we both work for Willie Stark. \n[235] \n[236]If you don't mind, Mrs. Stark... the boys have to get back to make the morning editions. Set 'em up on the porch, fellows. We'll take some pictures out here, first. \n[237]Mrs. Stark, please... All right, fellows, take one down there, will you please... Shoot it up this way. \n[238]I'll wait outside. \n[239]Who do you mean? \n[240]If and when you need it. \n[241]I'm going to give him a break. If he can prove it isn't true, I won't spill it. \n[242]I promised two people I'd do it this way. \n[243]Myself... and someone else. It doesn't matter who. I'm going to give him a break. \n[244]That's the way it's going to be. \n[245] \n[246] \n[247] \n[248] \n[249]Hey, Sugar! You'll never live to be impeached! \n[250] \n[251]I'm sure. \n[252]Judge, I beg you, as a favor to yourself, to me... call up, release your votes. \n[253]Judge, you know what Stark is capable of. Think it over. I'll leave now. I'll come back tomorrow and we'll talk about it again. You can give me your answer then. \n[254] \n[255]You'll get your answer tomorrow. \n[256]How did you find out? \n[257]For me too, Judge. \n[258] \n[259]Judge, I beg of you, call and release your votes, for your sake. \n[260]How did you find out? \n[261]You know we're through, don't you? \n[262] \n[263]Answer me. Did you give -- \n[264]No. \n[265]Yeah. I know. Well, I kept my promise. \n[266]Come in. The door's open. \n[267]What do you want? \n[268] \n[269]Stop it! \n[270]I know. I was here. \n[271]Tell him what? \n[272]About you and Willie? \n[273]How was it, Anne? You tell me. \n[274]Your brother is an old-fashioned man. He believes in his sister's honor. Me, I'm a modern man. The twentieth-century type. I run. \n[275]For who? Your brother, or Willie? \n[276]Who's through with who? \n[277]Better for who? Him. \n[278]Did he tell you that too when he asked you to betray the Judge? At least I walked out on him. \n[279]If I ever loved you. I'll go find Adam. \n[280]Do you know who Dr. Stanton is? \n[281]Did he try to come through here today? \n[282]Well, can you check the other entrances? \n[283]No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know. Pass the word along to the boys, will you? \n[284]Anne, Anne... Where are you going? \n[285]To do what? \n[286]No, that's too easy. \n[287]I do. \n[288]No, no more. \n[289]We're alive. \n[290]We've got to go on living. \n[291]So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people... \n[292]Look at them! They still believe in him. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything. \n[293] \n[294]Will you wait here? ", "Anne": "\n[1]We were just discussing whether you should... \n[2] \n[3]And do what? \n[4]Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been sure. You've gone from one thing to the other... a year at law school, and now this job as a reporter... \n[5]Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't care about the money. It... it's just that I... I want you to be something. \n[6]I don't know. It's just that I want you to be... to do... something important. \n[7]All right, Jack. I'll go away with you. I'll do anything you want me to do. \n[8]I'll wait for you. \n[9]I'm very glad to have met you. \n[10]Does he mean it, Jack? Does he? \n[11]   \n[12]Yes, certainly. \n[13]Please take me home now, Sugar Boy. \n[14] \n[15]Maybe we'd better stop seeing each other. \n[16] \n[17] \n[18]Why do you want to know? \n[19]Did he tell you -- \n[20]I don't know. I... how should I know if the Judge was ever broke? \n[21]Let's... let's have a drink first. \n[22]Adam! \n[23]Well, I'm not. What's wrong with being the director of the new medical center? \n[24]What other things? \n[25]Yes, me too. \n[26]But calmly. \n[27]But at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for. \n[28] \n[29]Jack, how is he? \n[30]Yes. \n[31]Oh, thank God. How is -- \n[32]He blames himself, doesn't he? \n[33] \n[34]He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. \n[35]He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. I love him, I guess. I guess that's the reason. \n[36]He wants to marry me. \n[37]Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce would hurt his career. \n[38]Jack... Jack, what are you going to do? You can't leave him now. He needs you now more than he ever did before. \n[39]You don't know him. You've known him all these years and you don't really know him at all. \n[40]Adam? \n[41]Jack... \n[42]I called you. All afternoon I've been calling you. \n[43]You've got to tell Adam. You've got to see him. \n[44]He knows about me and... \n[45] \n[46]He hit me, Jack. My own brother... he hit me. \n[47] \n[48] \n[49]He called me this afternoon. He's going back to Lucy. He said it was better that way. \n[50]Both of us. \n[51]Oh Jack... help me, please, please. Adam's all I've got left now. Oh, Jack, if you ever loved me... \n[52]I don't know. Leave me alone. \n[53]I don't care. \n[54]I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. \n[55]Leave me alone, please. \n[56]He's dead. \n[57]My brother's dead. \n[58]How? ", "Editor": "", "Alex": ""}}
