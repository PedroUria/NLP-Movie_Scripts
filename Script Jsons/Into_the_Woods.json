Where are we to get five pounds? \n[88]  \n[89]Huh? \n[90]Magic that defies description. \n[91]Six. \n[92]  \n[93]...possibly. Here. \n[94]Good luck there, young lad. \n[95]Take the cow and go home! \n[96]Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit? \n[97]Five beans?! \n[98]Of course. But... \n[99]I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father. \n[100]Because of my father. \n[101]I don't know... \n[102]All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own. \n[103]The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince.\" \n[104]As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open. \n[105]And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both. \n[106]I can't believe I just did that. \n[107]No thanks! \n[108]I'm a baker. \n[109]You need to be more careful, young lady. \n[110]Are you certain? \n[111]Thank you. Thank you! \n[112]The first night of the festival ball brought Cinderella her wish. The Prince danced only with her, `til he turned and she had slipped away. \n[113]  \n[114]  \n[115]A giant? \n[116]  \n[117]Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell. \n[118]No, no, no! It's not that-- \n[119]Wait. I didn't say-- \n[120]Hey, come back! \n[121]What are you doing here? \n[122]Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left. \n[123]Two. We've the cape and the cow. \n[124]What have you done with the cow?! \n[125]  \n[126]But she didn't! \n[127] \n[128]We were just going to do that. Here. \n[129]You can have this-- \n[130]I don't like that woman. \n[131]I shouldn't have yelled.  Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls. \n[132]GO!, please -- go. \n[133]As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. \n[134]Moo... Moo...... \n[135]The STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed opening in the base of a huge tree. We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair bobbing animatedly. \n[136]Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? \n[137]Milky-White! \n[138]I thought you were returning home! \n[139]  \n[140]Two. \n[141]Where did you find it? \n[142]Three! \n[143]We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then. \n[144]Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child. \n[145] \n[146] \n[147]Where did you get this? \n[148]   \n[149]You took five gold pieces?! I didn't take, you gave. \n[150]Now I never said you could. I You would take money before a said you might. child?! \n[151]No, no, no - it's not how it sounds! \n[152]When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower. \n[153]Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant. \n[154]We've only one day left! I don't know where to start. \n[155]Right, where do I buy a cow? \n[156]What are you going to do? \n[157]The yellow slipper? \n[158]Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it? \n[159]You think you could get one? \n[160]Right. Why are we always separating? \n[161]The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant... \n[162]...as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. \n[163]And in her haste, the Baker's Wife took no notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward. \n[164]As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands. \n[165]Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. \n[166]Lucinda was next. \n[167]Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. \n[168]As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. \n[169]As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. \n[170] Come on! We don't have any time... \n[171]You've got the slipper! \n[172]And the cape as red as blood. \n[173]We've done it! \n[174]We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did. \n[175]And we thought you'd prefer a live cow. \n[176]It's here... \n[177]She's going to bring Milky-White back to life. \n[178]She's a witch! She can do anything! \n[179]It's almost midnight! \n[180]And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn. \n[181]  \n[182]What? \n[183]That was quick! \n[184]And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. \n[185]Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. \n[186]And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. \n[187]And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever... \n[188]  \n[189]And the baby? \n[190]But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn. \n[191]Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase? \n[192]What do you mean? \n[193]We can help you find Granny's without the path. \n[194]Why does he always cry when I hold him? \n[195]He doesn't want me. He wants his mother! \n[196]I'll take care of him -- when he's older... \n[197]It's the Steward and the royal family. \n[198]What brings you into the woods? \n[199]What is the Royal family going to do? \n[200]A giant woman! \n[201]We haven't seen him. \n[202]Don't upset the Giant! \n[203]Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together. \n[204]Okay, I promise. \n[205]Jack! Jack! \n[206]We're never going to find him. \n[207]No. You can't be on your own. \n[208]What if we get lost? \n[209] You would leave our son with her? \n[210]But what if the Giant comes back... \n[211]Wait! Take this. It might be cold. \n[212]  \n[213]Four eighty two... four eighty three... Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen a boy... (notices she is \n[214]  \n[215]Earthquake? It's no earthquake -- there's a giant terrorizing the kingdom! \n[216]Hah, the Prince? No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden. \n[217]You look just like the Princess -- but dirty. Oh no, you are the Princess! \n[218]I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. \n[219]If you'd like you can come with me. You will be safe in our company. \n[220]This way. \n[221] \n[222]She should be back by now. \n[223]No, I must go and look for her-- \n[224]Let go of him! \n[225](at the top of his \n[226]Where did you find this? \n[227]It's my wife's! \n[228]What are you saying? \n[229]No. No...! \n[230]This is my fault. I let her wander off alone. I should have made her stay with me. \n[231]  \n[232]Yes! He's the one to blame!

My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything. \n[254]  \n[255]Son. \n[256]What are you doing here? \n[257]I don't want to talk to you. It's because of you all of this happened. Go away! \n[258]I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing. \n[259]Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans? \n[260]They were there and I wanted them. I didn't think. I was being careless -- \n[261]-- Selfish. \n[262] \n[263]You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away. \n[264]When your mother died, I was... I hated myself and I ran from my guilt and my shame... \n[265]... and your son. \n[266]Yes, and my son. And I'm sorry for that. \n[267]If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it. \n[268]I never expected... \n[269]Then what do you want? \n[270]Aren't you making the same mistake? \n[271]Aren't you running away?

Not so fast. \n[280]Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother... \n[281]She didn't make it. \n[282]No. It wasn't like that.

That cow doesn't look as white as milk to me. \n[56]This cow has been covered with flour! \n[57]Then where is she? \n[58]Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So show me the dead cow and I'll bring her back to life! \n[59]Stand back! \n[60]Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow. \n[61]You heard me!

Don't move! \n[72]Would you like a blind girl instead? \n[73]Not always. \n[74]I don't know where they think they're going. The giant's already destroyed the entire village. Only thing left of my garden are these beans. \n[75]We have no choice. Find the boy and give her what she wants. \n[76]And if we don't she'll kill half the kingdom! \n[77]Rapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness. \n[78]Surely you remember? Of course you don't recognize me! \n[79]This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you don't have to be embarrassed by me. You must come with me. There's a Giant in the land. \n[80]She's not going with you! You will come with me. \n[81]Then you leave me no choice. \n[82]  \n[83]I was just trying to be a good mother! \n[84]Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him. \n[85]No! Rapunzel! \n[86]  \n[87] \n[88]Look who I found! \n[89]I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant. \n[90]  \n[91]Wake up! When you're dead, you're dead.  Now it's time to get this boy to the Giant before we're all-- \n[92]This is no time to be soft-hearted!
