Hey -- happy birthday, Wayne. \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]Sorry, Phil? \n[5] ", "Henry": "\n[1]  \n[2]We're just -- \n[3]Doreen... \n[4]We're going to my sister's. \n[5]Jesus, Doreen, you caught a whole gang. \n[6]  \n[7]We are not going to send these people out to the wolves. \n[8]I -- I just don't think -- \n[9]He could take our boat. \n[10] \n[11]  \n[12]  \n[13]  \n[14]Shh. \n[15]Doreen, please. \n[16] \n[17]  \n[18]I'm gonna row back there and see if he'll shoot you. Or me. Fine either way. \n[19]Do you want me to get us out of here? \n[20]Then shut the fuck up. \n[21]  \n[22]Next time, when I say \"Let's evacuate,\" we're gonna evacuate.

Can't we take anything we want? \n[11]  \n[12]  \n[13]Kenny? \n[14]See him? \n[15]  \n[16]  \n[17]I'm glad you're enjoying this, Kenny, but if he's dead, how do we find the money? \n[18]\"With a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him, and pursues his enemies into darkness.\" From one of the more obscure -- \n[19]You may have more of these in you, Kenny, but Jim doesn't. \n[20]Jim, it could be anywhere. It might not even be in the school. \n[21]  \n[22]  \n[23]Why don't we just get him? \n[24]What the hell's going on? \n[25]You teach your students stuff like that? No wonder they kicked you out. \n[26]Excuse me, Jim. I hate to interrupt and all, but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here? \n[27] (off Jim and Mehlor's looks \n[28]Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot him, Jim. \n[29]  ", "Mayor's": "", "Wife": "", "Jim": "\n[1]  \n[2]'Scuse me a second. Take a look at thirty-one across. \n[3]Kenny can read. Just look at it. You know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong? Maybe it's right, but it doesn't look right? \n[4]Thirty-one across. \n[5]  \n[6]Did I get it right? \n[7]  \n[8]This is my retirement fund, boys, and if any one of you screws up, I swear to God I'll kill you. Let's go. \n[9]We're bringing a rope! \n[10]We'll be right there! \n[11]  \n[12]\n[13]  \n[14]Stop. \n[15]  \n[16]He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. Goddamnit! We just want the money! Get away and we won't have to kill you! \n[17]Now! \n[18]  \n[19]You got thirty seconds to get the hell away! \n[20]The clock's running! Go! \n[21]   \n[22]  \n[23]  \n[24]  \n[25]Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna need your science project. \n[26]Hold on. \n[27]Shut up. Everyone. \n[28]To stay alive. He thinks we'll kill him -- unless he knows where the money is and we don't. \n[29]There's always that. Either way, we got ourselves a sharp one. \n[30]Pretty soon the water'll be too deep for him to run. But for us it'll be just deep enough. \n[31]Here we go. \n[32] \n[33]The water isn't very deep yet. We need something with a low draft. Mr. Mehlor -- find us some gasoline. \n[34]  \n[35]Cut your engines! \n[36]Let's get him out. But for Godsake, whatever you do... ...don't kill him. Not until we find out where he hid that money. \n[37]Mr. Mehlor? \n[38]  \n[39]  \n[40]  \n[41]Oh, he's still alive. \n[42]  \n[43]Ray, I'm in need of a little inspiration. \n[44]No one likes this particular turn of events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- we can can either deal with it or we can walk away. There's a lot of money out there, so I choose to deal with it. If you want to go, that's fine -- start swimming. You want to stay, that's fine, too -- just stop your damn whining. \n[45]Keep looking. \n[46]  \n[47]  \n[48]  \n[49]They're in the water! Kenny, cut your engine! \n[50]  \n[51]Kenny, go that way. We'll go down here. \n[52]  \n[53]You're gonna be okay, Ken. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and he thinks you're gonna be okay. \n[54]Don't you, Mr. Mehlor? Don't you think Kenny's gonna be okay? \n[55]You kidding? We couldn't've done anything without you. \n[56]Your dad'd just want you to lay still while we got you some help. \n[57]See? You gotta trust me. \n[58]  \n[59]If our resourceful young friend hears us coming, he'll electrocute us or sink us or one of you'll shoot him. Besides... ...I know where he's going. What I'd like to know is where he came from. \n[60] \n[61]Now, I know it's your job to protect that money, and maybe you'd even be foolish enough to give your life for it. The question is, are you willing to give their lives for it? \n[62]Drop the gun and get into the boat. \n[63]Excellent choice. \n[64]  \n[65]I think it'd be best if -- \n[66]I think it'd be best if we all stayed together. \n[67]I don't know if that's -- \n[68](after a look at Doreen, nods to Mr. Mehlor \n[69]  \n[70]The only thing I want to hear from you is where the money is. \n[71]I wonder where they think they're going. \n[72] \n[73]  \n[74]Here? \n[75]They're not coming, son. \n[76]The National Guard. They're not coming. \n[77]I know you've been trying to stall until they show up, but they're not coming. \n[78]No, son, I didn't call them off. They never were coming. We didn't \"intercept\" Charlie's call. He called us direct. \n[79]We were gonna hit you just before you got on the Interstate, but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you -- \n[80]I knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company. His middle name was McCarthy because his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio. His wife's name was Mary. She died of a heart- attack last year. He has a daughter and a son, both grown with children of their own. I'm afraid I don't know the names of the grandchildren. \n[81]What else do I know...? Oh, yes. I know Uncle Charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime. \n[82]No, That was an accident. Ken shot him. I never told him Charlie was on my side. Ken liked to talk. He shouldn't've been here. But his dad asked me to watch over him. I guess I didn't do the best job. \n[83] \n[84]I'll take my chances. \n[85]Well, go get it. \n[86]What? \n[87]  \n[88]  \n[89]  \n[90]  \n[91]  \n[92] \n[93]  \n[94]  \n[95]  \n[96]  \n[97]Is he the one you thought was coming to your rescue? \n[98]  \n[99]  \n[100]  \n[101]  \n[102]  \n[103]  \n[104]  \n[105]  \n[106]  \n[107]  \n[108]  \n[109] \n[110]  \n[111]  \n[112]  \n[113]  \n[114] \n[115]  \n[116]Yeah. \n[117]Does he have the girl? \n[118]Hepatitis, hell. You probably already got cholera. \n[119]What're you doing? \n[120]You been in here before? \n[121]What happened? \n[122]Everything would have gone fine if you'd've just walked away from the truck. \n[123]You mean why was he doing this? No cancer. Didn't you ever think about taking the money? \n[124]Come now. A man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers never thought about what he'd do with three million dollars? \n[125]As little as possible. \n[126]I know where Belize is. What about it? \n[127]No, you didn't think about taking that money at all. \n[128]I'm sure. And I guess that's pretty much how it started with Charlie. \n[129]What -- you're gonna swim after her? \n[130]You ain't gonna help her by getting shot. He's gone and you don't know where. \n[131]You'll be dead before you get over the sandbags. Look, he'll be coming for us. You can ask him then. \n[132]I wouldn't worry about that. \n[133]  \n[134]  \n[135]  \n[136]  \n[137]  \n[138]In the boat. \n[139]What in God's name is that? \n[140] \n[141]Hold on? \n[142]No. \n[143]Look, I don't know what you thought but I told you, I'm here for the money; that's all. \n[144]  \n[145]  \n[146]Lord knows I should. \n[147]  \n[148]  \n[149]  \n[150]  \n[151]  \n[152]  \n[153]  \n[154]Fine. \n[155]For what? \n[156]I did? I just came for the money. \n[157] \n[158]You're going to turn it in? \n[159]Well, hell, then I guess I better take it after all. I figure the river'll carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico. If I catch the right currents, maybe I'll end up in... Belize? You come look me up. I'll buy you a drink. \n[160]Go. \n[161]Please. \n[162]Son, don't think too badly of your Uncle Charlie. He always said you were capable of remarkable things. He was right. \n[163]  \n[164]  ", "Karen": "\n[1]  \n[2]I was setting up pumps. \n[3]I wouldn't expect you to, Wayne. \n[4]I was gonna go as soon as I filled the pumps, but the next thing I know, I've got a looter on my hands. Now, maybe I'm crazy, but I was expecting a little gratitude? \n[5]I told you -- he was looting it. \n[6]  \n[7]I have to fill the pumps -- \n[8] \n[9]If you're not going to take me back to the church, then I'll swim. \n[10]What am I saying? \n[11]This is my boat. You swim. \n[12]They'll get him out. \n[13]  \n[14]I owed you -- for hitting you and all. But we're even now, okay? \n[15]I don't know. \n[16]Maybe another levee broke upriver. They've been -- \n[17]  \n[18]Tell them where the money is. \n[19]Well, I can. \n[20]So what do we do? \n[21] \n[22]No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked in. \n[23]You ever been robbed before? \n[24](not what she wanted to hear \n[25]What'd you do before this? \n[26]How'd you end up in this? \n[27]Nice favor. How's he gonna feel after tonight? \n[28]Oh, God. I'm sorry. \n[29]Well, whoever it is, he listens to Pat Benatar, Eddie Money and the soundtrack to \"Footloose.\" \n[30]  \n[31]  \n[32]  \n[33]  \n[34]  \n[35]What? \n[36]Hurry! \n[37]  \n[38]  \n[39]  \n[40]We thought it was empty. \n[41]Watch yourself, Tom. I really don't wanna have to save your life again. \n[42]  \n[43]Tom went off in their rowboat. \n[44]Back to the armored truck. \n[45]Stop! You'll hit Tom! \n[46]  \n[47]  \n[48]  \n[49]  \n[50]  \n[51]  \n[52]Sorry, Wayne, but I'm not playing a part in your sick little play. \n[53]Or what? You'll kill me? You're gonna do that anyway. \n[54]I'm sure you can hurt me. But it's all going to be the same when I'm dead. \n[55]  \n[56]  \n[57]  \n[58]  \n[59]Happy Birthday, Wayne. \n[60]  \n[61]There have to be keys.

Go back to selling hot construction machinery. That's a helluva career. \n[19]You think this is a joke? This is funny? Jesus Christ! You know how lucky you are you could get in here? Thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught? \n[20]Oh, yeah, it takes a lot of skill to fence bulldozers. That's goddamn genius time. \n[21]Oh, so that's all I've been doing, huh? Just wasting my life away. \n[22]Yeah, building a home, raising a family -- that's just stupid. \n[23]You know what, Tom?

When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it. \n[6]Damn right it's not. \n[7]Soon as we finish setting the traps. \n[8]Real slow now.

I'm a policeman in a small town. In the middle of the big flood last year, I was patrolling the streets in a boat, feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 'cause it was my birthday and all -- when I saw the front door to a house was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid it might be looters. Imagine my surprise when, instead of a looter, I find a young woman handcuffed to the railing of her stairs. Her name was Karen, and ever since she came back from college she'd made it clear she was too good for any of us local folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! I said, \"What the heck is going on here, ma'am?\" And she said... \n[43]And she said... \n[44]You're perfect for the role. I suggest you reconsider. \n[45]I might get clumsy. It might take a while. \n[46]And she said, \"Happy Birthday, Wayne. I've got something for you.\" Well, I'm not stupid. I knew what she wanted to give me and I knew she wanted to give it bad, so I -- \n[47] \n[48]  \n[49]I got the candles. All's we need is a cake. \n[50]Mood lighting. You in the mood yet? And then she said, \"My present's ready and waiting. All's you gotta do is unwrap it.\" \n[51]It was cold and rainy that birthday night, and all I wanted was to get someplace warm and dry. As it turned out, what I really wanted was something warm and wet.

You're the one who screwed him. \n[4] \n[5]I think it's great what you did. \n[6]Shut up. \n[7]Just bite me. \n[8]Karen, you know I'd do anything for you, but the Sheriff told me to get you out of town.

They're not looters. \n[21]How can you do this? \n[22]But -- but -- you're the Sheriff! \n[23]For twenty years you've been -- \n[24]I can't let you do it. \n[25]  \n[26]  \n[27] \n[28]You said if it goes it'll wipe out the town. \n[29]Don't you touch her! \n[30]  \n[31]  \n[32]  \n[33]  \n[34]  \n[35]  \n[36]  \n[37]  \n[38]No! We can't -- \n[39]  \n[40]She lives on Boyd Street. \n[41]  \n[42]Three over. Two-story, blue shutters. \n[43]  \n[44]", "Mehlor": "\n[1]  \n[2]I'll take a look, Jim. \n[3]  \n[4]Ray did five years in the hole at Joliet. The only thing you get to read in the hole is the Bible. \n[5]When you hit the switch you've got thirty seconds. \n[6]You been to a high school recently, Ray? My students taught me how to make things like that. Ready? \n[7]There is another possibility. He's thinking of keeping it for himself. \n[8]  \n[9]  \n[10]Jim! Over there! \n[11]Yeah, Kenny. You're gonna be fine. \n[12]This happened in a flood in Georgia. The ground gets soggy, and the caskets are air-tight -- anyone who hasn't been planted too long just pops up. \n[13]I didn't teach my students anything at all. \n[14]  \n[15]  \n[16]  \n[17]  ", "Tom": "\n[1]Well, it's not fast enough. \n[2]  \n[3]    \n[4]It's a flood, Charlie. You're gonna get wet. \n[5] \n[6]Your ear. \n[7]You've got a major hair growth going on. \n[8]I'm serious. You're gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker. \n[9]You're offering me one of your donuts? I don't know what to say. I'm getting all misty. \n[10]Nah. I start eating donuts and I'll never get out of this truck. \n[11]Don't get me wrong, Charlie. There's a lot to like about this job -- and I don't just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three-figure income. \n[12] \n[13]It had better hours. \n[14] \n[15]About as much skill as it takes to sit in a truck and get fat eating donuts. \n[16]I didn't say that. \n[17]I didn't say that! \n[18]Jerk. \n[19]Give us a kiss. Come on. \n[20] \n[21]What was that about? I mean, I'm just sitting here and all of a sudden you go postal on me. \n[22]You know, I really do appreciate what you've done for me. This is a good job. \n[23]Jesus. Where's the road? \n[24]Oh, God, here we go again. \n[25]Stop! \n[26]Stop the truck! We're going down! \n[27]Back up! \n[28]It's a little dip in the road or something. You can see the reflectors come up the other side. \n[29]I'll see if there's anyone coming. Maybe we can get pulled out. \n[30]The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there. \n[31]They are aware we're carrying a shitload of money...? \n[32]Ninety minutes? Jesus. \n[33]Oh, shit. \n[34]What about the money? \n[35]  \n[36]  \n[37]  \n[38]Why'd they do that? \n[39]Or so we can't see at all. \n[40]  \n[41]Anyone with a scanner from Radio Shack could've intercepted your call, Charlie. \n[42] \n[43]Turn down your lights! \n[44]  \n[45]  \n[46]  \n[47]  \n[48]   \n[49]  \n[50]  \n[51]  \n[52]  \n[53]  \n[54]  \n[55]  \n[56]  \n[57]  \n[58]Low tide, sailor. \n[59]  \n[60]  \n[61]  \n[62]  \n[63]  \n[64]  \n[65]  \n[66]Yee-hah! \n[67]  \n[68]  \n[69]  \n[70]  \n[71]  \n[72]I'm not a looter. \n[73]  \n[74]I just said I'm not a looter! You're the one who nailed me? You got a better arm than my ex-wife. What the hell did you hit me with -- a statue? I saw a flash of some guy coming at me. \n[75]Oh, great. Now I'm gonna have people coming from around the world to see the face of Jesus on my forehead. \n[76]Looking for a place to hide out. \n[77]The bastards who killed my partner. \n[78]We were driving an armored truck. The truck got stuck out past the high school. They must've picked up our call to dispatch, 'cause they knew where we were. Charlie and I were just standing there and all hell broke loose. \n[79]A little over three million. \n[80]The bank was afraid of looters. They had us cleaning out their branches up and down the river. \n[81]I hid it in the cemetery. Tied it to a crypt for a guy named Portman. \n[82]I don't like to carry around that much cash. \n[83]No, it was in my jacket and I -- \n[84]I'll go with you. I can show you where -- \n[85]Sheriff -- they killed my partner without any warning. \n[86]\n[87]  \n[88]   \n[89]  \n[90]Great! I can drive out of here! \n[91]  \n[92]  \n[93]  \n[94]   \n[95]  \n[96]  \n[97]Thank you. \n[98]Even. What happened? \n[99]Oh, God. \n[100]  \n[101]I can't. \n[102]If they know where the money is, they will kill us. \n[103]I guess just drive around until we run out of gas. \n[104]   \n[105]Cold? \n[106]No. The scariest thing that ever happened before was Charlie running out of donuts. I've only been doing this for a couple months. \n[107]I, uh... I sold construction machinery. I was making good money, it just... I don't know. It just didn't seem right for me anymore. \n[108]My uncle did me a favor; got me in. \n[109]My uncle was Charlie -- my partner in the truck. \n[110]God, I wonder whose car this is. \n[111]Really? Hold on... ...I think this is my car from high school. \n[112]Looks like we get out here. Come on -- I told your father I'd have you home by ten. \n[113]  \n[114]  \n[115]There! \n[116]  \n[117]  \n[118]Get your feet up! \n[119]  \n[120]Oh, shit! \n[121] \n[122]  \n[123]We've gotta --! \n[124]We have to --! \n[125]  \n[126]  \n[127]  \n[128]  \n[129]  \n[130]Jesus Christ! \n[131]It's okay. I have to go anyway. \n[132]The National Guard'll be at the truck in about fifteen minutes. I'm gonna go wait for them. \n[133]Karen? I'm Tom. \n[134](whispers to Henry, re: Doreen \n[135]  \n[136]  \n[137]  \n[138]  \n[139]  \n[140]  \n[141]I'll take you to the money, but you gotta let them go. \n[142]You say all you want is the money? Prove it. Let them go. \n[143] \n[144]\n[145]It's hard to tell now with the water so deep. \n[146]It's down there a little further. \n[147]  \n[148]Uh... no. A little farther -- \n[149]What? \n[150]I don't -- \n[151] \n[152]Bullshit. This is all bullshit. \n[153]Why'd you shoot him? Kill Charlie and you get to keep another share? \n[154]I'll tell you where it is. But it's not going to do you any good. \n[155]The Guard may not be coming, but someone else sure as hell is. \n[156]There. \n[157]It's gone. \n[158] \n[159]  \n[160]  \n[161]  \n[162]  \n[163]  \n[164]  \n[165]  \n[166]Well, that was unexpected. \n[167]  \n[168]  \n[169]  \n[170]  \n[171]  \n[172]  \n[173]  \n[174]  \n[175]  \n[176]  \n[177]  \n[178]  \n[179]  \n[180]  \n[181]  \n[182](beat, looks up at Jim \n[183]'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen. \n[184]We're too slow. \n[185]  \n[186]They're not going to catch us now. \n[187]  \n[188]  \n[189]Okay, so maybe they are gonna catch us now. \n[190]  \n[191]  \n[192]  \n[193]That hurt? \n[194]Good. \n[195] \n[196]Jesus, I'm gonna get hepatitis. \n[197]There's a back room. Maybe they've got something I can use on this. \n[198] \n[199]I saw Jesus. \n[200]  \n[201]So, has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would? \n[202]Oh, yeah? Well, everything would've gone even better if you hadn't decided to rob the damn truck in the first place! \n[203]Did Charlie have cancer or something? \n[204]No. \n[205]Sorry to disappoint you. What are you gonna do with it? \n[206]Belize. \n[207]It's this small country in Central America, on the Atlantic side. \n[208]They speak English and the dollar goes a long way. Beautiful beaches; friendly people. And they've got liberal banking laws. Very liberal. \n[209] \n[210]Shit. Where's he going? \n[211]The Sheriff knows. I think maybe I'll go ask him. \n[212]What if he doesn't come? \n[213]  \n[214]My God they're beautiful. \n[215]  \n[216]  \n[217]  \n[218]  \n[219]  \n[220]  \n[221]  \n[222]  \n[223]  \n[224]  \n[225]  \n[226]  \n[227]  \n[228]  \n[229]Where's Karen? \n[230]Where is she? \n[231]Where's her house? \n[232]What? \n[233]Hold on. \n[234]It's only a couple of bags. \n[235]But I thought -- \n[236]  \n[237]  \n[238]  \n[239]  \n[240]I'm guessing you can't get up. \n[241]Where? \n[242]Is that good or bad? \n[243] \n[244]  \n[245]  \n[246]  \n[247]  \n[248]  \n[249]  \n[250]  \n[251]  \n[252]  \n[253]You okay? \n[254]Oh, God. We gotta get you to -- \n[255]Thanks. \n[256]You just saved our lives. \n[257] \n[258]Sorry to disappoint you. \n[259]I'll do that. \n[260]  \n[261]  \n[262]They got a lot done today. \n[263]Barbecue chicken from Lilly's. \n[264]You want some? I wish you'd told me. I woulda got more. \n[265]I talked to Mikey. He says the flooring should be in by Friday. \n[266]I said if it wasn't here by Friday at six that you were going to go over and beat the crap out of him. "}}
