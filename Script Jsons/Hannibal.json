Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids. \n[200]Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property. \n[201]Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources. \n[202]\n[203]Due respect, sir... \n[204]Due respect, after your, after your... \n[205]<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. \n[206]...sir...? \n[207]Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings. \n[208]\n[209]...will he be alright...? \n[210] \n[211]\n[212]\n[213] \n[214]What would <u>that</u> be? \n[215]Now, why in the world would he do that? \n[216]What reaction? \n[217] \n[218]We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records. \n[219] \n[220]And how would you know that? \n[221]\n[222]You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>... \n[223]No, no, of course not. \n[224]Tell him to give it to an orphanage. \n[225] \n[226]\n[227]\n[228] \n[229]Yes. \n[230] \n[231]\n[232]For approval. \n[233]Yes. \n[234]I told that woman I'm an orphan. \n[235]But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.

Wanna arm wrestle...? \n[271]\n[272]Well.  Word gets around. \n[273]It wasn't my day. \n[274]It's a poor workman who blames his tools. \n[275]...how are things at the Hospital? \n[276]What have they got you doing? \n[277]I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. \n[278] \n[279]...you... \n[280]\n[281]Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you? \n[282] \n[283] \n[284]We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>. \n[285]And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. \n[286]Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em...

Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it? \n[326]Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room. \n[327]I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>... \n[328]No.  I want to buy a dog. \n[329]I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine... \n[330]...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'
