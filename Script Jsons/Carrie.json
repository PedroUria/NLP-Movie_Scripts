And take one! \n[9]Never mind the coin slot... It's broken. \n[10] \n[11]What...? \n[12]Carrie, don't you know...? You don't. I'll show you. \n[13]17 \n[14]Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there was such a thing. \n[15]Well, knowing that mother of hers... \n[16]Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they... \n[17]I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her. \n[18]It's just her period, for God's sake. \n[19]It's Carrie White. \n[20]I think Carrie can go home. \n[21]I'm sure she can walk home.

A really shitty thing. \n[33]  \n[34]Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy? \n[35] \n[36]Well, isn't he the lucky one. \n[37]And what about you, Sue? Who's taking you? \n[38]Right Okay. Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets. \n[39]  \n[40]That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd deserve it \u00ad I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one week's detention. \n[41]But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture? \n[42]  \n[43]That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets. Any other thoughts? \n[44]Right. Now change up. \n[45]The period's not up, Hargensen. \n[46]There are ten minutes left. \n[47]One more word from you and I'll throw you across the room.

Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time! \n[55]C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little... here, I'll show you. \n[56]Carrie's been asked to the prom. \n[57]Carrie White. \n[58]By Tommy Ross. \n[59]I think she put him up to it. \n[60]Who's brainstorm was this?
