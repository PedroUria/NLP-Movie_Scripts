Slay me and ten \t\t\t   will rise to take my place.  All \t\t\t   will die.  ALL WILL - \n[12]", "Witch": "", "Ash": "\n[1]\t\t\t   Why would you say that I am \t\t\t   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've \t\t\t   lost my mind simply because I've \t\t\t   heard the voices and seen the \t\t\t   godless things moving in the \t\t\t   woods. If anything, I think more \t\t\t   clearly now than ever before. I \t\t\t   know now that there is such a \t\t\t   thing as a living Evil. A dark \t\t\t   and shapeless thing that lives \t\t\t   not in the spaces we know, but \t\t\t   between them. In the Dark. In the \t\t\t   night. And it wants the exact same \t\t\t   thing as you and I: a chance at \t\t\t   warm life on this Earth. It \t\t\t   doesn't care that is already had \t\t\t   that chance ...once. Now listen \t\t\t   closely because there isn't much \t\t\t   time. Listen and believe, because \t\t\t   it's all true. \n[2]\t\t\t   I first saw the damn thing at that \t\t\t   blasted cabin. The Necronomicon. \t\t\t   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound \t\t\t   in human flesh and inked in human \t\t\t   blood. It contained bizarre burial \t\t\t   rites, prophesies...and \t\t\t   instruction for demon \t\t\t   resurrection. It was never meant \t\t\t   for the world of the living.  \n[3]\t\t\t   The book awoke something dark in \t\t\t   the woods. \n[4]\t\t\t   It got into my hand and it went \t\t\t   bad. \n[5]\t   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds. \n[6]\t\t\t   So I lopped it off at the wrist. \n[7]\t\t\t   In order to rid myself of the foul \t\t\t   thing, I read from a passage in \t\t\t   the book that was supposed to open \t\t\t   a hole.  A hole in Time that would \t\t\t   send the Evil back. And it worked. \n[8]\t   recites the incantation from the Necronomicon. \n[9]\t\t\t   ...I just didn't plan on coming \t\t\t   along. \n[10]\t   He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No scream. Only the steady \t   BEATING of his heart. \n[11]\t   He shields his eyes from a sudden bright light.  The funnel \t   cloud electrifies. \n[12]\t   RIPS at the fabric of Time. \n[13]\t   looks up from the dust to behold... \n[14]\t   stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures. \n[15]\t   waves a shaky hand. \n[16]\t\t\t   Take is easy now chief. I don't \t\t\t   know how I got here and I'm not \t\t\t   lookin' for any trouble. \n[17]\t   is cut. A thin red gash. \n[18]\t   leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns. \n[19]\t   rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air. \n[20]\t   gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face \t   as he gallops past.  The Warrior is sent reeling. \n[21]\t   galloping over a hill.  He is almost thrown by the horse, but \t   manages to hang on for dear life. \n[22]\t\t\t   Where the hell they put the \t\t\t   stirrups on this thing!!?? \n[23]\t   grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase. \n[24]\t   he rides past CAMERA, almost falling from the horse. \n[25]\t   glances behind him. \n[26]\t   They diverge to either side of CAMERA. \n[27]\t   whips his horse. \n[28]\n[29]\t   ducks the blade. \n[30]\t   ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again. \n[31]\t   yanks back upon his horse's reigns. \n[32]\t   ride at one another. \n[33]\t   He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of \t   his chainsaw arm bracket. \t   FOOMP!  He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into \t   place.  CLINK! \t   He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter \t   cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.  He curses \t   and yanks again. \n[34]\t   is knocked from his steed.  He tumbles to the dust, narrowly \t   escaping his own horse's hooves. \n[35]\t   rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves! \n[36]\t   raises his chainsaw.  CLINK!  He deflects the blow. Ash swings  \t   the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second \t   Horseman as he rides past. \n[37]\t   crumples.  He looks up in pain to... \n[38]\t\t\t   No! \n[39]\t   bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides \t   alongside him. \n[40]\t   shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle \t   walls. \n[41]\t   halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and the \t   prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at \t   swordpoint towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the \t   ground. This is THE PIT. \n[42]\t   looks to the jeering villagers that surround the pit, wondering \t   what they have in store for him. \n[43]\t   eyes Ash curiously.  This is Duke Henry the Red. \n[44]\t\t\t   Who wants to know? \n[45]\t\t\t   You ain't leadin' but two things \t\t\t   now, pal. Jack and shit.  And Jack \t\t\t   left town. \n[46]\t   stiffen in fear. \n[47]\t   watching with disbelief.  We hear the warrior's echoed cry of \t   terror, then a SPLASH as he hits bottom. \n[48]\t   is frozen in fear. \n[49]\t   jerks from the pit to... \n[50]\t   turns to Arthur and in a desperate, cowardly plea: \n[51]\t\t\t   Hey, I never even saw these \t\t\t   assholes before.. \t   He spins to Duke Henry the Red. \t\t\t   You gotta tell 'em you don't know \t\t\t   me. We never met. Tell him. \n[52]\t   tumbles down into the pit.  He lands in a STEAMING pool of foul \t   water at the pit's bottom.  He stands and coughs out a mouthful  \t   of the rancid water. He looks about. \n[53]\t   UNDERGROUND CAVERNS disappear into the blackness. \n[54]\t   spins to a small sound. \n[55]\t   Nothing.  Just the mist rising from the water. \n[56]\t   shifts his glance again. \n[57]\t   doesn't notice the misty water behind him beginning to stir. \t   Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone white eyes \t   break the surface. \n[58]\t   spins... but there's nothing there.  As he turns back around, \t   he is confronted by... \n[59]\t   and backs against the steep rock wall of the pit.  He tries to \t   scale the steep face. He gets one foot up. \n[60]\t   He falls away from the wall, his arms flailing. \n[61]\t   The Deadite's fist enters frame, slugging Ash. \n[62]\t   is knocked back into a shallow pool of steaming water. \n[63]\t   cries out in pain. \n[64]\t   cross to form a scissor lock around the Deadite's throat.  He \t   flips the beast. \n[65]\t   is thrown against the rock wall of the pit. \n[66]\t   trying to hear what the Wiseman is saying. His head jolts \t   backward, barely avoiding the beast's wild swing. Ash squints \t   to discern Wiseman John throwing something down to him: an \t   object falling at him through the glare above. \n[67]\t   summons his strength and leaps upward. \n[68]\t   ascending, his teeth gritted, every muscle straining, he soars \t   past CAMERA. \n[69]\t   snags the chainsaw, locking in onto his wrist bracket.CLICK! \n[70]\t   He lands on his feet, in the path of the approaching beast. \n[71]\t\t\t   Come on, you blasted piece of-- \t   He thrusts out his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and... \n[72]\t   is splattered with black bile. \n[73]\t   raises the chainsaw blade and neatly bisects the falling deadite \t   hand.  He spins and with a roundhouse blow... \n[74]\t   Ash decapitates the beast. \n[75]\t   climbs the steep wall of the pit when a SECOND DEADITE emerges \t   from the earthen wall before him. \n[76]\t   slams the butt end of the chainsaw into the beast, knocking it \t   back into the water. \n[77]\t   comes up, over the edge of the pit.  Followed by... THUMP!  Ash's \t   bloody hand.  Then his bruised face.  Covered in the black blood \t   of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet. \t   Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched. \n[78]\t\t\t   All right now. Who wants to be \t\t\t   next?  Who wants some. \n[79]\t\t\t   You want some more?  Huh?! \t   Gold Tooth and the others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out \t   to Henry. \n[80]\t\t\t   Now climb on those horses and get \t\t\t   out of here. \n[81]\t   slaps Henry's horse. \n[82]\n[83]\t   removes his sawed off shotgun from Wiseman John's horse and \t   turns to Arthur, then the crowd. \n[84]\t\t\t   This is my boomstick. It's a \t\t\t   twelve gauge, double barreled \t\t\t   Remington pump. Next one of you \t\t\t   primitives touch me... \n[85]\t   pointing the barrel just past Arthur. He, but no one else, has \t   spotted the surviving Second Deadite crawling up from the pit \t   on the forgotten chain. \t   The crowds gasp is cut short by....BLAMMITY-BLAM! \t   The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the chain, leaving \t   the Deadite teetering at the pit's edge. \n[86]\t   twirls the shotgun about western style: WHOOSH, WHOOSH, \t   WHOOSH...  and holsters it. \n[87]\t\t\t   Bring me your hoo do man. \n[88]\t   opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.  No sooner \t   has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.  He waves \t   it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet \t   on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand. \n[89]\t   sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.  She bandages \t   Ash's wounds. \n[90]\t\t\t   First you wanta kill me, now ya \t\t\t   wanna kiss me. \t   He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds. \n[91]\t\t\t   Lady, just leave me alone. \n[92]\t\t\t   They're mistaken. \t   She stares deeply into his eyes. \n[93]\t\t\t   Well what is it?  Can you send me \t\t\t   back or not? \n[94]\t\t\t   The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's \t\t\t   the thing that got me here. \n[95]\t\t\t   Me?  Now way, no day. Only place I'm \t\t\t   goin' is home. \t   A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire. \n[96]\t   turn to see... \n[97]\t   His haw drops.  He slowly stands as... \n[98]\t   clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her. \n[99]\t\t\t   It's a trick.  Get an axe.  \n[100]\t   watches the spectacle in horror as he sees... \n[101]\t   does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the \t   stone's deadly path. \n[102]\t   rolls across the dusty stone courtyard. \n[103]\t   rolls into frame and glances up to see... \n[104]\t   rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of... \n[105]\t   gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of \t   the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon. \n[106]\t   grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the \t   monster's oversized throat.  She chokes. \n[107]\t   He considers. \n[108]\t   points to the hand piece on a hanging suit of battle armor. \n[109]\t   tightens the tension on the shock absorber springs with a \t   ratchet like device. \n[110]\t   extends his arm triggering the tightly wound spring. \n[111]\t   SNAPS open with great force. \n[112]\t   clenches closed with such great power, that it bends a iron \t   goblet. \n[113]\t   He studies his new hand. It will do nicely.  \n[114]\t   stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with \t   apprehension.  The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears \t   behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent \t   cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around \t   her.  Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one \t   another and kiss. \n[115]\t   He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army \t   that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.  His chainsaw \t   juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.  Ash's cape \t   billows as he rides. \n[116]\t\t\t   What's going on? \n[117]\t   anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist. \n[118]\t   which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves. \n[119]\t\t\t   Clatto Verata Nicto.  Okay.  \n[120]\t\t\t   Clatto Verata Nicto. \n[121]\t\t\t   I got it.  I got it.  I know your \t\t\t   damn words. All right?  Now you get \t\t\t   this straight: I get the book, \t\t\t   you send me back. That's the deal. \t\t\t   After that I'm history. \t   Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist \n[122]\t   He whips the horse. \n[123]\n[124]\t   He gallops past.  CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick \t   fog. \n[125]\t   rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail \t   leading into a thick forest. \n[126]\t   rides slowly on through the darkening woods. \n[127]\t   He hears a sound and look to... \n[128]\t   hears a woman's soft laughter.  He glance to... \n[129]\t   kick his steed and bolts. \n[130]\t   frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which \t   jut from the ground. \n[131]\t   jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.  He \t   gracefully leaps a second tree.  But as he leaps over the third, \t   he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.  He falls hard to \t   the mud as the horse gallops off. \t   He groggily stands and stumbles onward. \n[132]\t   running for... \n[133]\t   comes upon the shed's door.  Locked.  He heaves his body against \t   it but it won't give. \n[134]\t   unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.  He slings the chainsaw \t   from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump bracket.  Click. \t   He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the V-SHAPED SLOT \t   that extends from his breastplate. CLICK.  He thrusts out his \t   arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life! \n[135]\t\t\t   Come on!  Come on! \t   The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt. \t   Putt. \n[136]\t\t\t   Blasted piece of junk! \n[137]\t   delivers a mighty kick to the door. \n[138]\t   presses himself against the door for all he's worth, praying \t   that whatever it out there, won't get in. \t   BANG!  Splinters fly. \n[139]\t   begins to SCREAM.  And the BANGING halts. \n[140]\t   as they are swept up at super speed in the grip of the Evil \t   Force.  Ash is seen rocketing through the long hallway of the \t   Shed, spinning head over heels.  Ash rips through other doors, \t   taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between two doors \t   as he flies through the air. \n[141]\t   enters the Mill. \n[142]\t\t\t   Anybody here?! \t   The place is quiet. Ash slumps down against a wall to catch his \t   breath. \n[143]\t\t\t   This place'll do for the night. \t\t\t   Get the book in the morning. \n[144]\t   peers through the window. \n[145]\t   listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship beneath the force \t   of the gale. \n[146]\t\t\t   Damn this cold. \n[147]\t   looks about the Mill and spots an iron stove. \n[148]\t   lights the fire with his Zippo lighter and huddles near the \t   flame for warmth. \n[149]\t\t\t   'least I won't freeze to death. \t   He turns to a tiny sound. \n[150]\t   behind him, through the window, a large gnarled hand sweeps \t   past.  \n[151]\t   spins, raises his shotgun and fires. \n[152]\t   Only the night woods.  The \"gnarled hand\" comes back, sweeping \t   down in front of the broken window, but it's revealed to be just \t   a tree branch swaying in the wind. \n[153]\t   reloads. He moves to the front door and peers out through a \t   crack. \n[154]\t   through the crack in the door. \n[155]\t   CAMERA pushes through the crack to the woods beyond.  There is \t   movement. \n[156]\t   He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks \t   breaking. \n[157]\t   It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward \t   Ash. \n[158]\t   leaps aside just in time. \n[159]\t   snags the horse's reigns. \n[160]\t\t\t   Easy, boy. \t   The horse calms.  Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A \t   shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill. \n[161]\t   He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out. \n[162]\t   stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the \t   Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill. \n[163]\t   races through the door and toward CAMERA when...SMASH...Ash's \t   reflection shatters. He's run into a mirror. Shivering, he picks \t   himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the \t   fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO.... \n[164]\t   Two inch high versions of himself.  They leap from the mirror \t   fragments and land on the floor. \n[165]\t   is unaware of them as he kneels close to the fire. \n[166]\t   grab a discarded dinner fork.  Like men on a battering ram, they \t   race forward to jam it into Ash's buttocks. \n[167]\t   SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward, banging his head into the \t   stove pipe. \n[168]\t   lift the barrel of the shotgun in Ash's direction.  Another \t   leaps upon the shotgun's trigger. BOOM! \n[169]\t   barely dives away from the blast the would have taken his head \t   off. \n[170]\t   SHRIEK with uncontrollable laughter.  They jump away from the \t   shotgun and scurry off across the floor. \n[171]\t   pulls the fork from his buttocks and heaves it. \n[172]\t   is running for his life, as fast as his tiny legs will carry \t   him. \n[173]\t   stumbles over a broom handle that has been thrust out in front \t   of him by other tiny ASHES.  His head slams into a stove pipe. \t   He crumples.  He lands with his cheek pressed against the hot \t   stove.  SSSSSSssss.  He pries his face loose with a spatula. \n[174]\t   and spills slippery grease about the floor. \n[175]\t   with an upside-down bucket on his head, slips and falls, back \t   and forth on the grease.  He stands and tries to dislodge the \t   bucket.  He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his \t   path.  He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting \t   needles jutting from it. \n[176]\t   SCREAMS and jerks upward, slamming his bucket head into the \t   stove pipe.  CLANG!  Ash rips the bucket from his head then yanks \t   the needles from his buttocks.  He looks about for the little \t   imps. \n[177]\t   crouching behind a log attempting to hide.  BUT... \n[178]\t   has seen him.  He \"accidentally\" elbows the log and Tiny Ash \t   #2 into the stove's fire. \n[179]\t\t\t   Ooops. \n[180]\t   is burned alive. \n[181]\t   glances downward at the pitter patter sound of tiny feet. \n[182]\t   is dashing across the open expanse of floor.  Ash's gigantic \t   foot comes down to crush the little man.  Tiny Ash #3 raises \t   a rusty nail into the path of the descending foot. \n[183]\t   jerks his leg upward in pain.  Ash dances about the place \t   hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the greasy area \t   of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust in \t   his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost \t   regains his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, \t   and hits his head on the stone floor. BLACKNESS. \n[184]\t   awakens on the floor of the Mill, like Gulliver he is bound with \t   tiny ropes.  Directly above him, on the edge of a table... \n[185]\t   suspend Tiny Ash #6 by his legs. \n[186]\t   stand atop Ash's face.  They push from either side of his \t   nostrils, plugging his nose.  Ash's mouth opens as he gasps for \t   air.  As he inhales... \n[187]\t   is released. \n[188]\t   He free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form \t   a perfect swam dive, plunges down into Ash's opened throat. \n[189]\t   inhales the living beast whole.  He chokes violently.  He breaks \t   his bonds an he hacks for breath.  He puts his finger down his \t   throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little man, to no \t   avail. \t   He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but they are \t   gone.  He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles \t   to a chair.  He goes pale. \n[190]\t\t\t   Nasty little thing's inside me. \t   He stands indignant but double over in sudden pain. \t\t\t   Well let's see how you like a \t\t\t   little hot water! \t   He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the scalding \t   contents painfully down his throat.  He sets down the kettle \t   and waits for a moment.  A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash's stomach \n[191]\t   emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his chest.  Then his \t   arm.  He rips back his shirt sleeve. \n[192]\t   We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6's body squirming down \t   Ash's arm, just beneath the skin. \n[193]\t   watches in horror as... \n[194]\t   lands next to an iron vice. He reaches for the EVIL HAND.  But \t   the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him on the head. \t   Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down into \t   the opened vice. \n[195]\t   with is head still wedged in the vice. \n[196]\t\t\t   Why you dirty little...AHHHHHH!! \n[197]\t\t\t   Soon as I get out of this thing \n[198]\t\t\t   No!  Not the teeth! \n[199]\t   struggling in the grip of the vice. \n[200]\t\t\t   Where the hell are ya!? \n[201]\t\t\t   I can't see ya!! \n[202]\t\t\t   No, no--not the poke-- \t   SSSSsssssssss! \n[203]\t   jerks his head free from the vice with a SCREAM.  He holds up \t   his iron hand.  It's back to normal.  Again under his control. \n[204]\t\t\t   Okay then. \t   But he halts abruptly as he feels a strange sensation: His \t   shoulder itches.  He scratches it.  The Itch grows.  It itches \t   madly.  He rips back his shirt.  Upon his shoulder... THERE \n[205]\t   SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of the mill.  The CAMERA \t   follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into the dark \t   woods. \n[206]\t   staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the  \t   brambles.  He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this \t   protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced. \n[207]\t\t\t   Dear God, it's growing bigger! \n[208]\t   Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical \t   heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another. \n[209]\t   opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head. \n[210]\t   retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head. \n[211]\t   collapses against a tree.  Under the light of the full moon we \t   see a terrifying sight: \n[212]\t   Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor, \t   propelled by his four arms and four legs.  Suddenly he stands \t   and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first. \t   He literally splits into two. \n[213]\t   They square off beneath the moonlight. \n[214]\t   circle one another like wolves. \n[215]\t\t\t   What... are you?  Are you me? \n[216]\t\t\t   WHAT... ARE GOO?  ARE GOO ME?!!  You \t\t\t   sound like a jerk! \n[217]\t\t\t   Why are you doing this?! \n[218]\t\t\t   Wanna know?  'cause the answers \t\t\t   easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash, \t\t\t   and yer... \n[219]\t   Dances a funny jig around Ash.  He SMACKS Ash across the face \t   as he sings: \n[220]\t\t\t   ...Little goody two- \n[221]\t   the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing \t   at his nose. \n[222]\t   blown backwards into a double backflip. \n[223]\t   slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground, \t   quite dead. \n[224]\t   clutching the smoldering shotgun. \n[225]\t\t\t   Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the \t\t\t   gun. \n[226]\t   staring down at the body of his evil self. \n[227]\t\t\t   I know better than to bury you \t\t\t   whole. \n[228]\t   falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil \t   twin.  He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly \t   task. \n[229]\t   with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill. \t   Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of \t   an old Oak Tree in the graveyard. \t   Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet \t   as he digs a grave. \n[230]\t\t\t   Now you see what's what.  Man's \t\t\t   body is his own personal property. \t\t\t   Don't anybody try to take that \t\t\t   away from him. \n[231]\t   finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.  As he heaves \t   the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out. \n[232]\t   It's eyes pop open!  It peers up at Ash from the grave.  It \t   croaks; \n[233]\t\t\t   You'll never get that Book. I will \t\t\t   come back for you. \n[234]\t\t\t   Hey, what's that you got on your \t\t\t   face? \n[235]\t\t\t   Huh? \n[236]\t   as a shovelful of dirt is heaped atop the CAMERA. \n[237]\t   buries it deep.  He raises a crude burial marker high above his \t   head; \n[238]\t\t\t\t   (muttering under his \t\t\t\t    breath \t\t\t   Rest in pieces. \n[239]\t   backlit by the moon, brings the burial maker swiftly into the \t   grave. A flash of lightning reveals... \n[240]\t\t\t   This must be it. The cemetery. \n[241]\t   moves toward the cemetery. \n[242]\t   In the center, lies a massive slab of black stone. \n[243]\t   draws closer, his teeth chattering as the wind blasts at him. \t   He glances down to... \n[244]\t   sitting atop the ground, leering up at CAMERA with empty eye \t   sockets. The wind whistles through the empty skull.  The jaw \t   bone drops open with a squeak. \n[245]\t   His hair is whipped up by the wind. He looks to... \n[246]\t   arrives at the foot of the massive stone. \n[247]\t   steps close. \n[248]\t\t\t   Wait.  Three books?  Nobody said \t\t\t   anything about that. Ha!  That \t\t\t   Wiseman was so busy fillin' me \t\t\t   fulla his secret words and phrases \t\t\t   and, and, his... bullshit, he \t\t\t   forgot to mention anything about \t\t\t   that.  Like do I take all of 'em \t\t\t   of one or 'em, or what?  Well... \t   He reaches for the first book and opens it. \n[249]\t   Wind hits Ash's face as he feels the suction of the book growing \t   stronger. \n[250]\t   is stretched as it's pulled down into the book. \n[251]\t   Ash's arms stretch down into the book's black page. \n[252]\t   stretched and screaming, is also pulled on by the book. \n[253]\t   A taffy stretched version of Ash struggles against the pull of \t   the black hole. He pulls free and snaps the book shut. \n[254]\t   His face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to \t   normal. \n[255]\t\t\t   Woah.  Wrong book. \t   He turns to study... \n[256]\t   tries to decide between them.  At first he's sure which one it \t   is.  Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses \t   the other. \n[257]\t\t\t   Huh. \t   Ash reaches for it again and the book bites him! \n[258]\t\t\t   Dear God, help me... ahhh!!! \t   The Batbook is pecking at his eyes! \n[259]\t   pulls it from his face and throws it. It lands back on it's \t   pedestal. \n[260]\t   faces the remaining book.  He slowly reaches for it as the wind \t   kicks up. Ash gently lifts it and turns it over. \n[261]\t   bristles in fear. \n[262]\t\t\t   Okay.   The words.  Say the words. \t\t\t   KLATOO!... VERATA...  uh...  Uh... \t\t\t   Necta... uh... Nectar... \t\t\t   Necktie... uh... \t   He hesitates, then calls out boldly. \n[263]\n[264]\t\t\t   Okay then. \t   But he loses his smile as... a LOW RUMBLE is heard on the \t   soundtrack. \n[265]\t   A tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by \t   one are thrust from the earth. \n[266]\t\t\t   Hey, wait a minute. Everything's \t\t\t   cool!  I said the words!  I did! \n[267]\t   falls. \n[268]\t   reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground \t   and clutches his face. \n[269]\t\t\t   No.. no more... \t   The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches. \n[270]\t\t\t   Leave me alone!  Leave me aHUUU! \n[271]\t   His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.  They \t   pull his ears and gouge his eyes. \n[272]\t   open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM! \n[273]\t   They bulge as he swallow the arm. \n[274]\t   jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.  He tumbles to \t   the ground. \n[275]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Keep you damn filthy bones outta \t\t\t   my mouth. \t   SNAP!  He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea \t   of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the \t   Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.  He leaps over \t   another set of groping arms that rip from the ground! \n[276]\t   atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see... \n[277]\t   is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the \t   earth. \n[278]\t   fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided, \t   decayed version of EVIL ASH! \n[279]\t   stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip \t   from the earth and shriek as they come back to life! \n[280]\t   kicks the horse and rides off. \n[281]\t   galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the \t   cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground. \n[282]\t   Now far from the danger but still he rides hard. \n[283]\t\t\t   I'm through bein' their garbage \t\t\t   boy.  I did my part of the \t\t\t   bargain. \t   He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins. \t\t\t   Now they owe me.  Like in the \t\t\t   deal.  I want back. \t   He whips his horse... \n[284]\t   A tiny figure, rides toward the castle. \n[285]\t   rides across the lowered bridge and into the torchlight of the \t   castle. \n[286]\t   is led to the THREE WISEMEN. \n[287]\t   pours a bucket of water over his head and begins drinking. \n[288]\t   slurps down more of the water, averting his eyes from the \t   Wiseman. \n[289]\t\t\t   Yes. It's just that... \n[290]\t\t\t   Nothing. Here \t   Ash produces the Necronomicon. \t\t\t   Now send be back. Like in the \t\t\t   deal. \n[291]\t   suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman John turns to him. \n[292]\t\t\t   Yeah.  basically.  \n[293]\t\t\t   Well, maybe not every single \t\t\t   syllable, no.  But basically I \t\t\t   said them.  Yes. \n[294]\t\t\t   Hey. We had a deal. You told me, \t\t\t   you could clean this thing up, \t\t\t   once I got you the book. You said \t\t\t   there was a passage in there that \t\t\t   could get rid of this thing and \t\t\t   send me back. \n[295]\t\t\t   You wanted the damn book. You got \t\t\t   yer book. I did my part of the \t\t\t   deal. \n[296]\t\t\t   Yeah. Well good. That was the \t\t\t   deal.  So uh...when do you think \t\t\t   we can... \n[297]\t   looks about at the condemned faces. \n[298]\t   CAMERA PANS past the doomed faces in the crowd. \n[299]\t\t\t   I mean...when can you send me... \n[300]\t   sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed with the guilt that he's \t   doomed her. \n[301]\t   is solemn. \n[302]\t\t\t   No.. They're right.  I screwed \t\t\t   up. I didn't come through for you, \t\t\t   and...  I'm sorry for it. \n[303]\t\t\t   Sheila... It's over for me. I \t\t\t   don't belong here and I'm going \t\t\t   home. I didn't have what it took. \t\t\t   It's over. \t   He bows his head and moves off. \t   A high pitched SHRIEK is heard! \n[304]\t\t\t   No! \n[305]\t   races to intercept.  He plants himself between Sheila and the \t   beast. \n[306]\t   opens his steel hand, then clamps it closed again on the handle \t   of his sword. \n[307]\t   swings his sword upward. \n[308]\t   spin to the sound of a woman's SCREAM. \n[309]\t   shakes his fist at the receding beast. \n[310]\t\t\t   Damn you! \n[311]\t   who stands on a high castle wall, clutching his smoldering \t   shotgun. \n[312]\t\t\t   Go ahead and run.  Run home and \t\t\t   cry to mama.  I'm through runnin'. \t\t\t   I stay we stay and fight. \n[313]\t\t\t   We'll get Henry the Red and his \t\t\t   men to fight with us. \n[314]\t\t\t   Then you'll die.  Honor and all. \t\t\t   Now who's with me? \n[315]\t   directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves. \n[316]\t\t\t   Dig!  Dig faster!  I want every black \t\t\t   hearted, worm infested, son of \t\t\t   a bitch that ever died in battle! \t\t\t   We'll storm their castle and take \t\t\t   the book!  Then my lads, eternal \t\t\t   life shall by ours! \n[317]\t   looks down at her with lust. \n[318]\t\t\t   Why ain't you a sweet little \t\t\t   thing? \t   His boney digit caresses her lips. \n[319]\t\t\t   Your gonna learn to live me missy. \n[320] \t   yanks her to her feet. \n[321]\t\t\t   Darlin' I'm gonna save him the \t\t\t   trouble. \t   He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace. \n[322]\t   is suddenly intercepted by FOUR OF HENRY'S HORSEMEN.  They \t   surround him. \n[323]\t\t\t   The Army of the Dead. \n[324]\t\t\t   They're headed towards Arthur's \t\t\t   castle. We need your help. Fight \t\t\t   with us. \n[325]\t\t\t   The only side I'm takin' is the \t\t\t   one that's gonna stop those \t\t\t   things. \t   Henry laughs. \n[326]\t\t\t   Because after they finish with \t\t\t   Arthur they'll come after you. \t\t\t   Together, we've got a chance. \t\t\t   Besides, you owe me. \n[327]\t   ride side by side on skeletal steeds.  Sheila lifts her black \t   veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture \t   of cracked leather.  She looks with admiration to... \n[328]\t   He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword \t   into the air and shouts in a gritty voice: \n[329]\t\t\t   Who rules?! \n[330]\t   look under the hood of the Delta 88, parked in the Blacksmith's \t   shop. \n[331]\t   frowns. \n[332]\t   pour molten iron into a large sand mold. \n[333]\t   walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who \t   stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard \t   at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash. \n[334]\t\t\t   You eyeballin' me boy? \n[335]\t\t\t   I can't hear you! \n[336]\t\t\t   You squeekin' like a mouse!  Are \t\t\t   you a mouse boy?! \n[337]\t\t\t   Where you from, mouse?! \n[338]\t\t\t   Only two things come from Perth: \t\t\t   steers and queers. Which are you? \n[339]\t   takes charcoal from a dead fire and chips of dried cow dung. \t   He mixes them with sulfur. \n[340]\t   draws back and releases the arrow. ZING! \n[341]\t   hears them before he sees them: The sound of clicking bones. \t   Painful moans of tortured souls, the clanging of approaching \t   armor. \n[342]\t   Fifty distant silhouettes of the Evil Dead appear on the \t   horizon.  Then fifty more. \n[343]\t   ride their steeds to a halt atop a hill. \n[344]\t\t\t   Where are they keeping my book? \n[345]\t\t\t   Excellent. Proceed. \n[346]\n[347]\t\t\t   Arrows! \n[348]\t   holds up a finger.  He waits. \n[349]\t   waits one more beat.  The turns to Arthur. \n[350]\t\t\t   Fire! \n[351]\t   turns to the South. \n[352]\n[353]\t   gestures. Swords slice through lines which send giant sacks of \t   black powder catapulting. \n[354]\t   turns to the Skeleton Captain #1 who rides alongside him. \n[355]\t\t\t   You needn't bother. \n[356]\t   slices off the head of Skeleton Captain #1. He turns to the \t   MOUNTED DEADITE next to him. \n[357]\t\t\t   You are now my captain. I will \t\t\t   now allow anything to stop me from \t\t\t   possessing the Necronomicon. Get \t\t\t   me into that castle. \n[358]\t\t\t   Arrows! \n[359]\t\t\t   He'll be here. \n[360]\t   looks terrified. He turns and runs from the castle entrance, \t   dropping his sword, and hides in the blacksmith's shop, pulling \t   the door closed behind him. \n[361]\t   smiles at Sheila. He turns his attention to the guarded tower \t   just beyond the parapet. \n[362]\t\t\t   The book shall be mine! \t   He raises his rusty sword. \n[363]\t   is at the helm. He pulls a cord. \n[364]\t   operates a crude instrument panel with only two levers to steer \t   the craft. It's a bumpy ride. \n[365]\t\t\t   Honey...You got real ugly. \n[366]\t   spins out his double barreled shot gun and... \n[367]\t   pulls hard on the steering stick and it tears loose from the \t   craft. \n[368]\t   tumbles from the helm and hits the ground. \n[369]\t   picks himself up from the dust. He looks upward to... \n[370]\t   races to a set of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two \t   deadites come at him. He grabs the rope with his steel hand and \t   slices one end of it with his sword. \n[371]\t   looks to... \n[372]\t   approaching the Necronomicon. \n[373]\t   kicks aside a hay bale and removes a mini-crossbow with four \t   flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He fires. \n[374]\t   watches in horror as... \n[375]\t   bring their swords together with such great force that sparks \t   fly.  Ash is forced back against the stone pedestal that holds \t   the Necronomicon. \n[376]\t   imbeds in a wooden beam. \n[377]\t   grabs the Necronomicon, then swings his sword at Ash. \n[378]\t   grabs a burning iron torch from its mount. \n[379]\t   swings his sword. Ash leaps over the blade. The Skeleton swings \t   downward, and Ash side steps it. \n[380]\t   rabbit punches CAMERA. \n[381]\t   delivers a right hook, spinning the skeleton's head around in \t   a circle. \n[382]\t   falls to the courtyard below, alongside the catapult. He glances \t   at the burning fuse. \n[383]\t   leaps from the parapet and lands atop the catapult. The Skeleton \t   looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of bone. \n[384]\t   Behold... \t   He gestures to the Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now \t   battle the last twenty of Arthur's warriors for control of the \t   Keep. \n[385]\n[386]\t\t\t   You're finished. \t   He extends the Necronomicon to taunt Ash. \n[387]\t\t\t   I possess the Necronomicon. I've \t\t\t   crushed your pathetic army. Now \t\t\t   I'll have my vengeance! \t   He raises his sword for the death blow... \n[388]\t   turn... \t   A jubilant CHEER rises from the castle as... \n[389]\t   has grabbed a sword from a fallen warrior. With a single motion \t   he slices the hand that holds the Necronomicon from Skeleton \t   Ash. \n[390]\t   snags the book with one hand and on the backswing, slices \t   through the rope, springing the catapult. \n[391]\t   are dipped into the flame of a bonfire.  They ignite. \n[392]\t\t\t   We said goodbye to Arthur.  Sure \t\t\t   we had our problems.  But in the \t\t\t   end, he was all right. \n[393]\n[394]\t   watch the funeral pyre sail off.  It's flickering flames play \t   upon their faces. \n[395]\t\t\t   Peace was made between the two \t\t\t   peoples.  And a new nation was \t\t\t   formed.  They offered my a chance \t\t\t   to stay among them and teach them. \t\t\t   A chance to lead them.  To be \t\t\t   King.  But Sheila was gone. \t\t\t   Besides, I had places to go. \n[396]\t\t\t   Yeah.  Right... \t   Ash takes the flask and studies it. \t\t\t   ...but what other choice did I \t\t\t   have? \n[397]\t   rides off. \n[398]\t\t\t   I had to find a place to crash. \t\t\t   For a very long time. \n[399]\t   with the aid of his horse, drags the Deathcoaster inside the \t   cave. \t   He sets the horse free. \n[400]\n[401]\t   Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave.  He \t   ignites the fuse and climbs into the car. \n[402]\t\t\t   I locked the door. \n[403]\t   uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman's brew. \n[404]\t\t\t   I closed my eyes. \t   He lets six drops fall into his mouth.  One for each century \t   he must sleep. \n[405]\t\t\t   I took a drink. \t   Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth!  A \t   7th drop!  Ash swallows the liquid. \n[406]\t\t\t   I didn't know if it was day or \t\t\t   night. I started... to get \t\t\t   drowsy... And I slept... \n[407]\t   falls into a deep slumber. \n[408]\t   now in a different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave. \n[409]\t\t\t   ...And dreamed. \n[410]\t   wind faster and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse \t   photography. The leather band rots away and the watch falls from \t   Ash's wrist. \n[411]\t\t\t   Dreams last lasted centuries.  \n[412]\t   awakens in a heap of rusted scrap, which was once the \t   Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having deteriorated, he is \t   buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave. He digs \t   at the rocks that block the cave's entrance.  Sunlight streams \t   into the hole he has created. \n[413]\t   climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight. \n[414]\t\t\t   And when I awoke... \n[415]\t   beholds... \n[416]\n[417]\t\t\t   ....I found that I had slept too \t\t\t   long. \n[418]\t   is so small a dot now, and so far away, that we almost can't \t   hear his terrified SCREAM!
