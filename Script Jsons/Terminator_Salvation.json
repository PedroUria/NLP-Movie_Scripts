This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? \n[7]Not yet-- not for years. So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- \n[8]You can skip the act, we know what you are. \n[9]Who does? \n[10]John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was-- Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity. \n[11]Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret. \n[12]Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.

Lucky me. \n[3]You don't need to be scared. \n[4]Cancer? \n[5]I'm a regular hero. \n[6]No one lives forever. \n[7]What can I say. I was seventeen, I was angry, I was stupid. \n[8]Hallelujah. \n[9]Hey!   Yo, over here! \n[10]Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on... \n[11]Oh God... \n[12]You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real. \n[13]I thought I was in hell. \n[14]Those things with masks, red eyes-- \n[15]If I'm not in hell, where am I?! \n[16]First put down the shotgun. \n[17]I don't wanna kill anyone. \n[18]I don't like it when people point guns at me. \n[19]You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid. \n[20]In the city. \n[21] \n[22]That wasn't a helicopter... \n[23] \n[24]What year is it? \n[25]Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years. So who did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese--? \n[26]The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it? \n[27] \n[28]That flying grapefruit, what was it? \n[29]Jalape\u00f1o sauce. \n[30]No thanks.     Not hungry. \n[31]I look the same. \n[32]Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint. \n[33] \n[34]She your sister? \n[35] \n[36]You don't know me. \n[37]Skynet runs the machines...?   So who's this John Connor? \n[38]Yeah, right. Him and Jesus. \n[39]You're asking the wrong guy. \n[40] \n[41]Well... Nah, some of `em were all right. My little brother Max, pretty wild kid, not much older than you-- he stole a car, just joy-riding, y'know, showing off. \n[42]Cop chased him right into our front yard, pulled him outta the car... and started whaling on him, kicking the shit out of him. No reason for it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran out of the house, guy tried to pull his gun on me-- guess I just went off on him. Don't even remember it really... they say I broke his neck. Max must be dead too, now... like everybody else. \n[43]Sure. \n[44]The bible. My grandma always tried to get me into it, but-- it always put me to sleep. Still does. \n[45]\"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--\" \n[46]\"Guaranteed lowest prices... open seven days...\" \n[47]It's a flower. A rose. \n[48]  \n[49]You know, pianos, guitars... \n[50]Come on. You must... \"I can't get no... satisfaction...\" \"We are family... I got all my sisters with me...\" No, huh. How about... \"Twinkle twinkle little star...\" \"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...\" \n[51]You OK? \n[52]It's called driving.   Sure. \n[53] \n[54]Pop the clutch! Let your foot up! \n[55]Sort of. \n[56]No!    You're doing fine. \n[57]Ssh. \n[58]Stop the car. \n[59]Other pedal, other pedal! \n[60]Damn it.    Empty. \n[61]What is this? \n[62]Spit it out! \n[63]Oops. \n[64]Name's Marcus. \n[65]I'm heading that way. \n[66]I've got to get to my friends-- \n[67]Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster-- \n[68]Hydrobots? \n[69]You're with the Resistance. \n[70]I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die... \n[71]Let's hear it. \n[72]What the hell for? \n[73]I've never seen trees like these. \n[74]Freaky. \n[75]What was that? \n[76]They're surrounding us. \n[77]Dog eat dog world. \n[78]Staf?   What's that mean? \n[79]I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice... \n[80]I dunno. They just... sorta reminded me of her. \n[81]There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me. \n[82]We're in somebody's garden. \n[83]Over there. \n[84]Boo! \n[85]Get me the hell down from here! \n[86]Why are you doing this?    What is this place? \n[87]Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was. \n[88]What are you talking about? \n[89]I'm a man! \n[90]Even if I never been treated like one. \n[91]Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. Do it! \n[92]So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? \n[93]Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him? \n[94]This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me? \n[95]So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go. \n[96] \n[97]You're out of your mind, aren't you? \n[98]Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me? \n[99]Hello? Anyone there? I'm thirsty. \n[100]I need water. \n[101]Please, I'm-- \n[102]Why are you doing this? \n[103]So what am I...? \n[104]You think they'll buy that? \n[105]I'm heading across the river. \n[106]I'm not human, remember? \n[107]It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense... \n[108]For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead. \n[109]Where's that go? \n[110]Thank you. \n[111]Don't mention it. \n[112]What the hell is this? \n[113]Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings-- \n[114]Marcus. \n[115]I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere. \n[116]This isn't food. \n[117]Terminators! \n[118]What are you? \n[119]A hybrid-- human and machine? \n[120]Jesus... why? \n[121]What about the ones who weren't? \n[122]Your family. You lost them? \n[123]Why are you smiling? \n[124]Tell me everything.   How did you people get here? \n[125]Angel-- what is it? \n[126]English! \n[127] \n[128]Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! \n[129]You all work for Skynet! \n[130]The end of the world. \n[131]Into-- this? A brain in a box? \n[132]Destroying the human race in order to save it. \n[133]What are you doing? \n[134]No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you! \n[135]I'm not sure I know how to describe it. \n[136]When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring. \n[137]A time machine... Connor was right. \n[138]...I've just heard him speak. \n[139]In the world outside-- the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this? \n[140]Then why... Some people I knew were picked up, taken here... \n[141]Yes... what is this place? \n[142]That's them. \n[143]Of course.     I... I understand. \n[144]What is it? \n[145]I need to go back! \n[146]What do I do? \n[147]Let them go. \n[148]I said, let them go! \n[149]Now you're pissing me off. \n[150]How'd that feel? \n[151]I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain! \n[152]Last chance. Let them out. \n[153]I'm gonna need your clothes. \n[154]We've gotta get out of here. \n[155]Stay down! \n[156]It's OK, I'm not human! \n[157]You can't drive! \n[158]I know.   Long story. \n[159]Take that path! \n[160]The trees! \n[161]You two all right? \n[162]There. \n[163]I'm sorry. \n[164]There are more prisoners, a complex about a mile in-- \n[165]Yeah, well. Get in line. \n[166]I don't feel a thing.    Help somebody else. \n[167]They're not people anymore... \n[168]No! \n[169]No one lives forever. \n[170]I have no idea. I should be dead... \n[171] \n[172]Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus machine. \n[173] \n[174]I never really believed in heaven. \n[175]You're asking me to become... Him? \n[176]Why me? \n[177]Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ", "Wright": "", "Kate": "\n[1]He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton. \n[2]Where did they find him? \n[3]Because people trust you... you give them faith-- \n[4]\n[5]What is it, John? \n[6]What?   Find who? \n[7]All to find one teenage boy...? John, you really think this can work? \n[8]Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid. \n[9]He wants to see you. \n[10]Kyle, could you give us a minute? \n[11]Marcus... you're going to need to be rebuilt. Your face, your body, your voice... We have people who can do it. \n[12]But you won't be the same... \n[13]The scar will help hide the change. \n[14]  \n[15]Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp... you're a hero. \n[16]Please.   We need you. ", "Connor": "\n[1]--hello-- standing by-- \n[2]Not what I expected... \n[3]It does seem lifelike-- is the face able to mimic emotions--? \n[4] \n[5]This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless... were you sent here from the future? \n[6]Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions. I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins... \n[7]Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions. \n[8]Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26. \n[9]I want him extracted. \n[10]Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs. \n[11]Kate, why did I become leader of the Resistance? \n[12]No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die... \n[13]So how could I not know about this?! \n[14]I need to talk to the prisoner. \n[15]Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor. \n[16]At ease.   Please, sit. \n[17]I've gone over your record, lieutenant. You're a good soldier, flown a lot of missions... Why in God's name would you help a terminator escape? \n[18]We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't-- \n[19]What friends? \n[20]Kyle. \n[21]Reese. \n[22]I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how. \n[23]My father. \n[24]What is it? \n[25]Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources. We're sending in a rescue team ASAP. \n[26]I'm standing here, I exist-- so it must have worked. We will find him. \n[27]Call it an act of faith. \n[28]John Connor. I'm glad you made it. \n[29]Seems I owe you an apology. \n[30]The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. And the people in the houses, they won't leave-- \n[31]This... this can't happen... \n[32]Her name was Sarah... she was... amazing... \n[33]Keep it. \n[34]You must. \n[35]I never knew how I was supposed to win this war.

They patrol places like this, looking for survivors. \n[12]Any red ones? \n[13]Mm.    Ketchup. \n[14]So can I. Well, sort of... a little. \n[15]Never heard anyone say that before. \n[16]You ever watch television? \n[17]I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great. \n[18]Dunno. Been together since we was little. Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell... she and me are the only ones still around. \n[19]We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet.
