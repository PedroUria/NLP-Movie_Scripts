Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful. \n[5]Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya. \n[6]Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world.  They're about to get squeezed.  We can't let that happen.  I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw-ups.  I needed the best. The best.  So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department...and here we are. \n[7]The set-up is simple, Dutch. One day job.  We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there.  You've done it a hundred times.  Nothing out of the ordinary. \n[8]Not to worry, Dutch.  I haven't lost my edge.  They've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake. \n[9](pointing to the map \n[10] \n[11] \n[12](shouting to Schaefer \n[13]Have you picked up their trail yet? \n[14]They're getting better equipped every day. \n[15]Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time. \n[16]  \n[17]  \n[18] \n[19]On your nine!!! \n[20]This is beautiful!  More than we ever thought.  We got the bastards! \n[21]  \n[22] \n[23]Because I told you, you're the best.  I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story. \n[24]We've been lookin' for this place for months.  The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down.  Hopper                        * was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up,  I had to stop there bastards.  We were so close, we couldn't quit.  We couldn't sleep through this one.  I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that? \n[25]To invade a foreign country, illegally?  You lied, Dillon. Stacked the odds against us.  Set us up.  You could have gotten us all killed. You used to be one of us, Dillon, someone I could trust with my life... \n[26]We've been through a lot together Dutch.  When we were together, no                  * one could stop us, the hottest                     * Goddamned team the army ever saw.                  * But things changed, I woke up. We're fighting them in a dozen Goddamned countries.  It's a fight we can't lose, Dutch.  We're all expendable assets, can't you see that? \n[27] \n[28] \n[29]She's too valuable.  She's got to know their whole network.  The whole set up. We take her with us.                               * \n[30]You're still under orders, Dutch.  You want to make the call, or should I? \n[31] \n[32]Yeah, what is it, Sergeant? \n[33]Thanks. \n[34]   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[35] \n[36] \n[37]Watch her. \n[38]That isn't what she said... she said... ...she doesn't make sense. \n[39] \n[40]The wound all fused, cauterized...what the hell did this? \n[41] \n[42](to phone; angry \n[43](angry; shocked \n[44]I can accept that, it comes with the job. \n[45]Mac.  Who hit us today? \n[46](abruptly; pushing \n[47]Ask her again.  What did she see?  What happened to Hawkins? \n[48]He's losing his cool.  There's nothing out there but a couple of men that we're going to have to take down. \n[49]You're wastin' your time. \n[50] \n[51]What the hell do you think you're doing? \n[52]What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten                        * minutes.                                           * \n[53]That rendezvous is ten maybe                       * twelve miles, at most!  We're                      * almost home.  But the chopper                      * won't wait. \n[54] * \n[55]Now what, Dutch.  You going to send your mystery guest an invitation? \n[56] \n[57] \n[58]What is God's name...? \n[59]No way, Dutch.  I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here. \n[60]Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch.  Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right.  Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along. \n[61]You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to quit. \n[62]Right behind you. \n[63]    ------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n[64] \n[65]  \n[66]Take a position over there.

Shooting in all directions. \n[6]I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense. \n[7]  \n[8]    \n[9]Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be a real bitch.
