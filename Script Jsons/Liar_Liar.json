With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case? \n[3]Interesting, though based on your track record, I expected a little more. \n[4]Let go! \n[5]Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. \n[6]Fine, thank you. \n[7]I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to -- \n[8]Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband. \n[9]However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars. \n[10]Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. \n[11]All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. \n[12]I see. And do you .know what Mrs. Cole and her male visitor did during their frequent... visits? \n[13]With the Court's permission, I would like to play the tape. \n[14]Your witness. \n[15]   \n[16]Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness! \n[17]Uh...no questions. \n[18](defeated, to \n[19] ", "Appleton": "", "Audrey": "\n[1](checks her \n[2]Thanks, Max. \n[3]  \n[4]Stanford.

His name is Jerry and yes, he's going. \n[8]I've been seeing him seven months, what do you think? \n[9]. Well you have to remember when \n[10]Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston. \n[11]Ready? \n[12]Are you alright? \n[13]I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, \n[14]Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say? \n[15]I can't just pick up and move to Boston with two days notice. \n[16]It's just not that simple... What about my job?

To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. \n[222]Monster-Max. \n[223]No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. \n[224]I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen? \n[225]That's why he should have worn make-up. \n[226]Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. \n[227]Yes. \n[228]No matter what. \n[229]In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no. \n[230]Not in a million years. \n[231]Uh-uh. \n[232]Only if you can't 'swim. \n[233]Because your mom buys it. \n[234]I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together. \n[235]. Yes! This is absolutely an \n[236]Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back. \n[237]Not to you. \n[238]Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me \"How do I lo ok?\" So I'd say, \"Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? \n[239]Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? \n[240]Will you help me anyway? \n[241]That's my boy! \n[242]Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. \n[243]Great! Great! Now to test -- \n[244](rubbing his sore \n[245]Only what? \n[246] \n[247]Why not?! \n[248]I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies-- \n[249]I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? \n[250]I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. \n[251]Short and shrivelled. \n[252]No -- \n[253]No -- \n[254]No -- \n[255]Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! \n[256]No. \n[257]   \n[258]My son hates me. \n[259]O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a \u00b7wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day. \n[260]It came true. \n[261]It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning? \n[262]That's right!     I am incapable of lying. \n[263]  \n[264]Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse. \n[265]You don't believe me. \n[266]Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. \n[267]  \n[268]Greta, please... Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? \n[269]In a way. \n[270]Jumbo's House of Junk. \n[271]I'll give you the raise! \n[272] \n[273] \n[274]Hold on, please, \n[275]Mom... Well, I wasn't actually on vacation... Because I didn't want to talk to you... Because you insist on talking to me about Dad's bowel movements -- size, color, frequency... I'll call you later... No, not really. \n[276]Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the Judge! Greta... \n[277]I'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. Don't leave. \n[278]Yes? \n[279]No. . . but what' s your poijit! \n[280] \n[281]Aaaah! \n[282]Extremely. \n[283]  \n[284]He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. \n[285]Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye. \n[286](eagerly and a \n[287]--   until now. \n[288]Fu-- fu-- \n[289] \n[290]Well, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. \n[291]Your Honor, I object! \n[292](can't help \n[293]No questions. \n[294](afraid to ask \n[295] \n[296]Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break? \n[297]Not unless you want to mop up. \n[298]What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! \n[299]I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! \n[300]  \n[301] \n[302]Yes, I can. \n[303]Hello. \n[304](summoning up \n[305]The twins. \n[306]Sure. \n[307](sees Virginia \n[308]I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? \n[309]Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions-- \n[310]Exactly. \n[311]Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... \"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--\" \n[312] \n[313]C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question! \n[314]Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. \n[315]Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole? \n[316]Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? \n[317]If I might rephrase your Honor. Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not? \n[318]Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? \n[319]How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking?              ' \n[320]Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- \n[321](screaming at \n[322]  \n[323]I have no further witnesses, your Honor. \n[324]What are you doing? Call me. \n[325] \n[326]You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! \n[327] \n[328] \n[329]  \n[330]Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia? \n[331]But that would be a lie, wouldn't it? \n[332]Isn't your true name... \n[333]Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? \n[334]Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then? \n[335]And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you? C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will. \n[336]So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? \n[337] \n[338]Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR \n[339](knows he has \n[340] \n[341]What? \n[342]He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? . \n[343]But -- but -- you said he was a good father. \n[344]No.                                            . \n[345]Excuse me. Just a second. Y our Honor? Your Honor? Wait! \n[346]Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? \n[347]T his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too? \n[348]  \n[349]-Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away. I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners! \n[350] \n[351]Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS \n[352] \n[353] \n[354]  \n[355]Audrey!   It's Fletcher-- \n[356]Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good... Pack?! Did you say pack?! \n[357]A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello? O ne more call!! I need another call!! \n[358]And what about our water su pply ? You don't think \"the man's\" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ \"The man\" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. \n[359]That's me. Fletcher T. Reid. Pawn no. 332-154-9867. \n[360]Audrey? Greta?! \n[361]Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at you, you well preserved, underpaid, overworked, underappreciated thing you. G iv e me a hug! You came and got me out!! Hug me!! \n[362]Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here.., \n[363]Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth. \n[364] \n[365] (checks his \n[366]Shiiiiit!!! \n[367]Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... \n[368]W h y ? What for? For changing lanes? \n[369]No ! I paid them! This morning! That's the truth!      I swear!! \n[370]The computer is wrong! It computer's a liar! \n[371](checks his \n[372]That's right, no! I'm not gonna lose my son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer. Now if you want to follow me, car after I get where I'm going. I'm a lawyer and I k now my rights!

I've got ten years worth of dirt on you and this firm, and I'm in the kind of mood today to get a lot off my chest. You let me use the phone or I start talking!! \n[383] \n[384]You're saving my life, Philip. \n[385]No. It's not silly.       I don't like you. \n[386]I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face. I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? \n[387]Then why are you always trying to socialize with me? \n[388]Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant. Never! \n[389]Not at all. \n[390]Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... \n[391]Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... \n[392] \n[393]Ahhh!! !    Damn..; \n[394]What?

Audrey is now trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.  \n[398]  \n[399](mumbles to \n[400]  \n[401](to Audrey and  \n[402]Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, \n[403]I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. \n[404]I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. \n[405]I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again? \n[406]How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec? \n[407]One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    .. \n[408]Just let me present my case. \n[409]I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! \n[410]You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more important things. Much more important things. I was so stupid, Max. Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. \n[411]Max. .. it's 9:22. \n[412]Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. \n[413]No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore.
