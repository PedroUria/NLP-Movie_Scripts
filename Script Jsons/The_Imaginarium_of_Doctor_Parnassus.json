Are you saying he's ridiculous? \n[24] \n[25]He takes advantage. \n[26]Puhlease. \n[27]Parnassus is a pain. Okay he's extraordinary but I'm not. I don't want to be like him. I want to be like other people. Like them.  You know... normal. Ordinary. You're so lucky. \n[28] \n[29] \n[30] \n[31] \n[32]I go to all this trouble and you leave it. \n[33]Are you ill? \n[34]Now what? \n[35] \n[36]Percy liked the soup. \n[37]That's normal isn't it? \n[38]You know it doesn't agree with you. \n[39] \n[40]You think you're so clever and that everybody else is an idiot!

Too many. \n[83]Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so... \n[84]... so young. She was everything I had ever dreamed of. I made a choice. I bargained away my immortality.

Many years ago...? \n[38]\n[39]Many centuries ago, as a matter of fact... \n[40]... I was visited... by someone I had hoped never to meet. \n[41]... Having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the Chief Steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... He dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow-swept plain. \n[42]A rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world... \n[43]... The Steward woke and remembered his dream. What manner of man had he dreamt of, and what did it signify? \n[44]We tell the eternal story. \n[45]The story that sustains the universe. The story without which there is nothing. \n[46]You make it sound so simple. \n[47] \n[48] \n[49]Stop! \n[50]A sign! A message! That bird was a messenger... from distant places we know not of! Other places! The point is, you're wrong! And I'm wrong! It doesn't have to be us here! Somewhere in the world, at any given time... someone is telling a story! Sustaining the universe! Right now, it's happening. \n[51]That's why we're still here. You can't stop stories being told somewhere! You can't be everywhere! \n[52] \n[53]And so I made a wager with the devil. \n[54]Whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... My argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... His, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... Naturally... I won. \n[55]My prize... ... was ever-lasting life. \n[56]Everlasting torment... Everlasting... Everlasting... Times changed. No one wanted our tales any longer. \n[57]It seemed as though the Devil, after all... had triumphed... And then... one day.... \n[58]From the very first moment I saw her, I was head-over-heels in love. She was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... But I... I was several thousand years old! How could I woo her? What could I do? \n[59]At times like these... the devil is never far away. \n[60]The devil granted me mortality again...and youth and great powers. I won my bride. I was in love. But at what price... \n[61] \n[62]...at what price.... \n[63]We've stopped. \n[64](turning back to his Tarot \n[65]Go and see! \n[66]Why are you fishing dead people out of the river? He's dead. Leave him. Let's go. Before the police turn up. \n[67]Dammit! I told you to leave him. He was dead. \n[68]Hanging? \n[69]The hanged man! \n[70]These marks...

I'll skin him alive! \n[123]Quite another kettle of fish. \n[124]He's ambitious, energetic... a man of destiny. \n[125]I think he might. Valentina sees good in him. \n[126]Perhaps I should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls. \n[127] \n[128]What are you doing? Please concentrate.
