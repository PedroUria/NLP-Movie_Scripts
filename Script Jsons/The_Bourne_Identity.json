Some of you very closely... \n[2]...He was an irritation before he took power. He was a problem when he was in power. And he's been a disaster for us in exile. Wombosi likes to send us messages through the European media. This is an interview we pulled down from a local German television station in Dresden. We've been getting these little broadsides every couple of months. He knows this -- he knows that -- he's writing a book about the Agency's history in Africa -- he's going to name names. It's basically a shakedown... \n[3]This interview -- and I'll make the tape available for anyone who wants it -- he goes on to claim that he has just survived an assassination attempt. He says it's us. He says he's got proof. The overwhelming negative ramifications of this should be obvious.
