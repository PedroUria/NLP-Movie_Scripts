That bastard.] \n[4]Perverts d'homosexuels! \n[5]Do you like French cars? \n[6]I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to seventy-five.  Very nice. \n[7][Shit!  That bastard.] \n[8]Perverts d'homosexuels! \n[9] \n[10][I mean I'm not sure.] \n[11][And I'm not sure.] \n[12][I just fucking told you, I don't know.] \n[13][It didn't.] \n[14][No.  It's just a guess.] \n[15][Yes.] \n[16][Shit these masks are really hot.] \n[17][Let's see.  Okay.  An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery.  All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.] \n[18][The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town.  Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, \"I wanna eat some pussy.\"] \n[19][I'm not done.  Listen.  \"Where've you been,\" said the greasy fellow behind the desk, \"fifty francs won't get you a close look these days.\"] \n[20][\"Listen buddy,\" said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, \"I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!\"] \n[21][\"Okay, okay,\" gasped the proprietor, \"I'll see what I can do.\"  So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. \"She's yours for fifty francs,\" said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.] \n[22][After a little while, he came across a piece of egg.  \"That's funny,\" he thought to himself, \"I don't think I had egg for breakfast.\"  But he spat it out and kept eating away.  Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth.  \"I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week,\" he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn.  \"What is this?\" he said, \"I think I'm going to be sick.\"] \n[23][\"Ya know,\" says the whore, \"that's what the last guy said.\"] ", "Bellboy": "\n[1] \n[2]Ah...telephone, for the room service. \n[3]The toilet. \n[4]To hang the clothes. \n[5]From here you can operate the television. \n[6] \n[7] \n[8]Ah.

We have a lot to talk about. \n[5]Is she your girlfriend? \n[6]Fuck her. \n[7]She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out. \n[8]Don't be silly.  It's dangerous. \n[9](in French with English \n[10][No.  Come on you fucking slut!] \n[11]  \n[12]God damn it! \n[13][Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore!] \n[14] \n[15]Oh shit.  Her clothes. \n[16]La ferme! \n[17]So tell me, what have you been up to? \n[18]Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me. \n[19]Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores.  A girl like that will give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs? \n[20]Just use your hand like me. \n[21]I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys. \n[22]No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking.  It will make them respect you. \n[23]Just put on a shirt and a sport coat. \n[24]  \n[25]I'm glad you came.  How long has it been? \n[26]It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.  Now here. \n[27]But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came.  That's good. \n[28]You would have been stupid to. \n[29]After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy.  And then I bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The newspaper. \n[30]Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris.  You know, like terrorists. \n[31]It's fun. \n[32]   \n[33]The people next door are on holiday.  We took their phone.  If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead. \n[34]I don't know.  I think it's asleep but it's been there for days. \n[35]I guess it is dead. \n[36]      \n[37]Hello. \n[38] \n[39]They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa salauds.

BIP.  The Banque Internationale de Paris.  And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes? \n[48]We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this. \n[49]As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him.  Then we can close the bank.  No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed. \n[50]Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him.  Don't worry about that. \n[51]Here.  This is where they keep the days reserve cash.  Okay fuck that. \n[52]There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into.  This is where the real prize is. \n[53]Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber. \n[54]No, that's too long. \n[55]Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be in and out. Like that.  Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and... \n[56]Another vault. \n[57]I don't know...it connects the two vaults. \n[58] \n[59]I don't know. \n[60]But this entry way is too small to get the platen out.  We have a lot of merchandise in there. \n[61]You could open it in five minutes? \n[62] \n[63]Tomorrow. \n[64]But of course. \n[65]It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what to do. \n[66]You don't need to know shit.  Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest. \n[67]Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we live life.  It's better that way.

And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo. \n[79]  \n[80] \n[81]Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves.  Do you see? \n[82] \n[83] \n[84]Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.  That's good. \n[85]You know I have AIDS.  From the needle. \n[86]Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe. \n[87]  \n[88]I'm glad you came.  How long has it been? \n[89]It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.

You can buy another one. \n[203]Excellent.  What next? \n[204]It's okay.  I'll find it for you. \n[205]I think it would be better if I looked for you.  I could-- \n[206]Oh, I wouldn't want to do that. \n[207] \n[208] \n[209]It worked! \n[210]Oh my God it worked! \n[211]Then do it.

What is it Claude?] \n[239][What are you doing Claude?  Talking of all this false doubt.  What do you think we're going to do?] \n[240][Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough.  And killing all these assholes-- ] [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of good now, is it?] \n[241][No.  Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane.] \n[242][Claude, you are a mental giant.  Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?] \n[243][I'm going to see how things are going.] \n[244][They want to fuck with me!?

I kill a man and they don't care.  They say they don't make deals with terrorists.  It really fucks up my plan.] \n[259] \n[260][What are you looking at you fucking whore?] \n[261][Are you afraid I'll tell these people that this is only a day job for you?] \n[262][What?  So they know that you're a--] \n[263][Shut up!] \n[264][My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with.] \n[265] \n[266][Bitch!] \n[267]Kill her!  Kill her! \n[268]What the fuck are you doing!? \n[269]Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much?  She's really fucked with your mind. \n[270]Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke. The attention.  They have no idea of who they're dealing with.  They have no idea what kind of men we are. \n[271]You can no longer be in our club.  You forfeit your cut of the pie. \n[272]Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me. \n[273]Never let a girl come between two men. \n[274]Now let's try to get out of here. \n[275] \n[276][Jesus, what now?] \n[277][Get a hostage.] \n[278][Think!] \n[279]Zed. \n[280] \n[281]Zoe.

This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass.  You find your own. \n[285]Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a sausage. \n[286]Did you see how she ran?  Did you see how she ran?  She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one.  What do you say Zed? \n[287]I will kill you.  And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here.  I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it.

I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.  I didn't understand the difference. \n[42]If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable.

I'm just curious. \n[21]No.  Just the ones I like. \n[22]Yes. \n[23]Because you're...a good person.  I run into some real creeps.  You know. \n[24]Body language.  We fit together. \n[25]No, but you know, we clicked.  You made me orgasm.  Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with? \n[26]Usually never.  They're almost always fat like pigs. \n[27]And you make me feel safe.  That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm. \n[28]Well, it's true. \n[29]Turn off the television. \n[30]So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much. \n[31]Honest? \n[32]Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can orgasm.  Even with his own hand. \n[33]I am not a prostitute! \n[34]I'm a student.  And to pay for the classes I became an escort.  It's my choice to sleep with you. \n[35]What?  You don't understand. \n[36]Hey, it's not easy. \n[37]I'm here because I want to. \n[38]The Centre du Art, Paris. \n[39]Not any of the old shit. \n[40]I have a day job too.  Three times a week. \n[41]But someday there will be only my art. \n[42]I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects. Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with no narrative.  I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.  Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny.  Those are left for me.  They belong only to me.  If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I would destroy it.  I don't care how much cash they would offer me.  It would be shit.  I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.  They told too much about me.  And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself.  The way I'm telling you. \n[43]What I do I do only for the objects. \n[44]What?  So you could see the work of a whore? \n[45]The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm. \n[46]If I do...you'll never know which one it is.  Because I'll be the only one who understands.  I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from. \n[47] \n[48]I'm going to take a shower. \n[49][Fuck you.] \n[50][Let go of me you shit!!] \n[51][Give me my clothes you asshole!] \n[52]Ouvres!

I have a car. \n[67]  \n[68]We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there. Do you feel pain? \n[69]I have a shower.  You can clean up there. \n[70]My name is not Zoe.
