The name is \t\t\tNeo.  \tThe handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, \tseparated in the crash like a severed limb.  \n[7]\t\t\tWe'll need a search running.  \n[8]\t\t\tIt's already begun.  \tWe are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER \tand CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out \tlike a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall \tthrough one --  \tSwallowed by the darkness that becomes --  \tA computer screen.  \tWe are on-line, inside a chat room called \"The Matrix.\" \tIt is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.  \n[9]\t\t\tAs you can see, we've had our eye \t\t\ton you for some time now, Mr. \t\t\tAnderson.  \tHe opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he \tflips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at \tthe file or at him.  \n[10]\t\t\tIt seems that you have been living \t\t\ttwo lives.  In one life, you are \t\t\tThomas A. Anderson, program writer \t\t\tfor a respectable software \t\t\tcompany.  You have a social \t\t\tsecurity number, you pay your \t\t\ttaxes and you help your land lady \t\t\tcarry out her garbage.  \tThe pages continue to turn.  \n[11]\t\t\tThe other life is lived in \t\t\tcomputers where you go by the \t\t\thacker alias Neo, and are guilty \t\t\tof virtually every computer crime \t\t\twe have a law for, including the \t\t\tunauthorized use of the D.M.V. \t\t\tsystem for the removal of \t\t\tautomobile boots.  \tNeo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.  \n[12]\t\t\tOne of these,lives has a future. \t\t\tOne of them does not.  \tHe closes the file.  \n[13]\t\t\tI'm going to be as forthcoming as \t\t\tI can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are \t\t\there because we need your help.  \tHe removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice- \tblue.  \n[14]\t\t\tWe know that you have been \t\t\tcontacted by a certain individual. \t\t\tA man who calls himself Morpheus. \t\t\tWhatever you think you know about \t\t\tthis man is irrelevant to the fact \t\t\tthat he is wanted for acts of \t\t\tterrorism in more countries than \t\t\tany other man in the world.  He is \t\t\tconsidered by many authorities to \t\t\tbe the most dangerous man alive.  \tHe leans closer.  \n[15]\t\t\tMy colleagues believe that I am \t\t\twasting my time with you, but I \t\t\tbelieve you want to do the right \t\t\tthing.  It is obvious that you are \t\t\tan intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, \t\t\tand that you are interested in the \t\t\tfuture.  That is why I believe you \t\t\tare ready to put your past \t\t\tmistakes behind you and get on \t\t\twith your life.  \tNeo tries to match his stare.  \n[16]\t\t\tWe are willing to wipe the slate \t\t\tclean, to give you a fresh start \t\t\tand all we are asking in return is \t\t\tyour cooperation in bringing a \t\t\tknown terrorist to justice.  \tNeo nods to himself.  \n[17]\t\t\tYou disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.  \n[18]\t\t\tThe irony of your situation is \t\t\tthat you have no choice.  \n[19]\t\t\tAnd tell me, Mr. Anderson, what \t\t\tgood is a phone call iy you are \t\t\tunable to speak?  \tThe question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to \tfeel the muscles in his jaw tighten.  \tThe standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion \tgrow into panic.  \tNeo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly \tseal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his \tmouth is gone.  \tWild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents \trestrain him holding him in the chair.  \n[20]\t\t\tYou are going to help us, Mr. \t\t\tAnderson, whether you want to or \t\t\tnot.  \tSmith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.  \tFrom a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a \tlong, fiber-optic wire tap.  \tNeo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over \this exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the \telectronic device animates, become an organic creature \tthat resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.  \tThin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into \tNeo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature \twhich looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --  \tBefore it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it \tworms its way inside.   \n[21]\t\t\tDo we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?  \tCypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his \tteeth.  \n[22]\t\t\tThen we have a deal?  \n[23]\t\t\tWhatever you want, Mr. Reagan.  \tCypher takes a deep drink of wine.  \n[24]\t\t\tAccess codes to Zion.  \n[25]\t\t\tMorpheus.   \n[26]\t\t\tEighth floor.  They're on the \t\t\teighth floor.   \n[27]\t\t\tEighth floor!  Move!   \n[28]\t\t\tWhere are they?   \n[29]\t\t\tAre orders that hard to follow? \t\t\tI'll say it again.  Morpheus must \t\t\tbe taken alive.  Understand?   \n[30]\t\t\tHow like a rodent.   \n[31]\t\t\tWe have them now.   \n[32]\t\t\tSo, we meet at last.  \n[33]\t\t\tSmith.  I am Agent Smith.  \n[34]\t\t\tI've been waiting for this noment.  \tFaster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a \tjaw-breaking right.  \n[35]\t\t\tYou can't win.  \tMorpheus smiles.  \n[36]\t\t\tTake him.  \tCops swarm over Morpheus.   \n[37]\t\t\tThe others were lost.  \n[38]\t\t\tYou've taken care of Reagan?  \tAgent Jones nods.  \n[39]\t\t\tThen the others do not matter.   \n[40]\t\t\tThere is a problem.  Reagan has \t\t\tfailed to secure the hardware.  \tAgent Smith stares out the window.  \n[41]\t\t\tNever send a human to do a \t\t\tmachine's job.  \n[42]\t\t\tBut if Reagan has failed, why \t\t\thaven't they pulled the plug?  \n[43]\t\t\tHaven't you learned by now, that \t\t\tit is impossible to understand why \t\t\tthey do the things they do?  \tHe turns.  \n[44]\t\t\tContinue as planned.  Trace his \t\t\tsignal to locate their position \t\t\tand deploy an extermination unit.  \tMorpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist. \tHe is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of \tserum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked \tup to various monitors with white disk electrodes.  \tAgent Brown begins running a trace program.   \n[45]\t\t\tHave you ever stood and stared at \t\t\tit, Morpheus?  Marveled at its \t\t\tbeauty.  Its genius.  Billions of \t\t\tpeople just living out their \t\t\tlives... oblivious.  \tAgent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a \thypodermic needle.  \n[46]\t\t\tDid you know that the first Matrix \t\t\twas designed to be a perfect human \t\t\tworld?  Where none suffered, where \t\t\teveryone would be happy.  It was a \t\t\tdisaster.  No one would accept the \t\t\tprogram.  Entire crops were lost.  \tAgent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and \tplunges down.  \n[47]\t\t\tSome believed we lacked the \t\t\tprogramming language to describe \t\t\tyour perfect world.  But I believe \t\t\tthat, as a species, human beings \t\t\tdefine their reality through \t\t\tsuffering and misery.  \tAgent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react \tviolently to the injection.  \n[48]\t\t\tThe perfect world was a dream that \t\t\tyour primitive cerebrum kept \t\t\ttrying to wake up from.  Which is \t\t\twhy the Matrix was re-designed to \t\t\tthis:  the peak of your \t\t\tcivilization.  \tHe turns from the window.  \n[49]\t\t\tI say 'your civilization' because \t\t\tas soon as we start thinking for \t\t\tyou, it really becomes our \t\t\tcivilization, which is, of course, \t\t\twhat this is all about.  \tHe sits down directly in front of Morpheus.  \n[50]\t\t\tEvolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.  \tHe lifts Morpheus' head.  \n[51]\t\t\tLike the dinosaur.  Look out that \t\t\twindow.  You had your time.  \tMorpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the \tpain racking his mind.  \n[52]\t\t\tThe future is our world, Morpheus. \t\t\tThe future is our time.   \n[53]\t\t\tI'd like to share a revelation \t\t\tthat I've had during my time here. \t\t\tIt came to me when I tried to \t\t\tclassify your species.  I've \t\t\trealized that you are not actually \t\t\tmammals.  \tThe life signs continue their chaotic patterns.  \n[54]\t\t\tEvery mammal on this planet \t\t\tinstinctively develops a natural \t\t\tequilibrium with the surrounding \t\t\tenvironment.  But you humans do \t\t\tnot.  You move to an area and you \t\t\tmultiply and multiply until every \t\t\tnatural resource is consumed and \t\t\tthe only way you can survive is to \t\t\tspread to another area.  \tHe leans forward.  \n[55]\t\t\tThere is another organism on this \t\t\tplanet that follows the same \t\t\tpattern.  Do you know what it is? \t\t\tA virus.  \tHe smiles.  \n[56]\t\t\tHuman beings are a disease, a \t\t\tcancer of this planet.  You are a \t\t\tplague.  And we are... the cure.   \n[57]\t\t\tWhy isn't the serum working?  \n[58]\t\t\tPerhaps we are asking the wrong \t\t\tquestions.  \n[59]\t\t\tOr he doesn't know.  \n[60]\t\t\tOf course he knows.  He's \t\t\tresisting.  \n[61]\t\t\tHow?  \n[62]\t\t\tI don't know.  If I knew...  \tAgent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming \tangry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to \tagents.  \n[63]\t\t\tLeave me with him.  \tAgent Brown and Jones look at each other.  \n[64]\t\t\tNow!  \n[65]\t\t\tCan you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm \t\t\tgoing to be honest with you.  \tHe removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his \tshoulder.  \n[66]\t\t\tI hate this place.  This zoo. \t\t\tThis prison.  This reality, \t\t\twhatever you want to call it, I \t\t\tcan't stand it any longer.  It's \t\t\tthe smell, if there is such a \t\t\tthing.  I feel saturated by it.  I \t\t\tcan taste your stink and every \t\t\ttime I do, I fear that I've \t\t\tsomehow been infected by it.  \tHe wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips \tof his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.  \n[67]\t\t\tRepulsive, isn't it?  \tHe lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both \thands.  \n[68]\t\t\tI must get out of here, I must get \t\t\tfree.  In this mind is tlie key. \t\t\tMy key.  \tMorpheus sneers through his pain.  \n[69]\t\t\tOnce Zion is gone, there's no \t\t\tneed for me to be here.  Do you \t\t\tunderstand?  I need the codes.  I \t\t\thave to get inside Zion.  You have \t\t\tto tell me how.  \tHe begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.  \n[70]\t\t\tTell me!  Tell me!  \tThe skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown \tburst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.  \n[71]\t\t\tWhat were you doing?  \tAgent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.  \n[72]\t\t\tYou don't know.  \n[73]\t\t\tKnow what?  \tAgent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what \the is hearing.   \n[74]\t\t\tI think they're trying to save \t\t\thim.   \n[75]\t\t\tLower level --  \n[76]\t\t\tThey are actually attacking.   \n[77]\t\t\tFind them and destroy them!  \tAgent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.   \n[78]\t\t\tOnly human...  \tSuddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He \tscans the roof.  Trinity is gone.  \tImmediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the \tmuzzle of her .45 --  \tJammed right into his head.  \n[79]\t\t\tRemain at your posts.  \n[80]\t\t\tYou will do as you are ordered!  \n[81]\t\t\tNo.  \tThe GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a \tcacophony of CRASHING GLASS --  \tAs the Agents go for their weapons.  \tBut Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and \tBULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.  \tAgent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, \tblood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --  \tThen Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.  \tAnd finally Agent Jones.  \tNeo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.  \n[82]\t\t\tNooo!  \tHe FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a \tperfect line.  \tFor an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the \tWALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of \tchalk.  \tAnd as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet \tburies itself in his leg --  \tKnocking him off balance.  \n[83]\t\t\tThe trace was completed.  \n[84]\t\t\tWe have their position.  \n[85]\t\t\tThe extermination unit is in \t\t\tplace.  \n[86]\t\t\tOrder the strike.  \tAgent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to \tthe edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding \tcity.  \n[87]\t\t\tThey're not out yet.   \n[88]\t\t\tYou're empty.  \tNeo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.  \n[89]\t\t\tYou can't win.  \n[90]\t\t\tDo you hear that, Mr. Anderson?  \tAgent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to \tlook down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a \thole in the darkness.  \n[91]\t\t\tThat is the sound of \t\t\tinevitability.  \tNeo sees it coming and he starts to fight.  \n[92]\t\t\tIt is the sound of your death.  \tThere is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as \tAgent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.  \n[93]\t\t\tGoodbye, Mr. Anderson.  \tThe TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.  \tThe veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the \tpain.  \tHe is not ready to die.  \n[94]\t\t\tCheck him.   \n[95]\t\t\tHe's gone.  \tAgent Smith smiles, standing over him.  \n[96]\t\t\tI told you, you couldn't win.   \n[97]\t\t\tNooooo!  \tAgent Smith pounds on the elevator door.   ", "Smith": "\n[1]\t\t\tLieutenant?  \n[2]\t\t\tLieutenant, you were given \t\t\tspecific orders --  \n[3]\t\t\tThe orders were for your protection.  \tThe Lieutenant laughs.  \n[4]\t\t\tNo, Lieutenant, your men are dead.   \n[5]\t\t\tDid you get anything from the \t\t\troom?  \n[6]\t\t\tWe'll need a search running.  \n[7]\t\t\tAs you can see, we've had our eye \t\t\ton you for some time now, Mr. \t\t\tAnderson.  \tHe opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he \tflips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at \tthe file or at him.  \n[8]\t\t\tIt seems that you have been living \t\t\ttwo lives.

They're on the \t\t\teighth floor.   \n[25]\t\t\tAre orders that hard to follow? \t\t\tI'll say it again.  Morpheus must \t\t\tbe taken alive.  Understand?   \n[26]\t\t\tHow like a rodent.   \n[27]\t\t\tWe have them now.   \n[28]\t\t\tSo, we meet at last.  \n[29]\t\t\tSmith.

It is something that isn't supposed to happen to \tagents.  \n[53]\t\t\tLeave me with him.  \tAgent Brown and Jones look at each other.  \n[54]\t\t\tNow!  \n[55]\t\t\tCan you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm \t\t\tgoing to be honest with you.  \tHe removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his \tshoulder.  \n[56]\t\t\tI hate this place.  This zoo. \t\t\tThis prison.  This reality, \t\t\twhatever you want to call it, I \t\t\tcan't stand it any longer.  It's \t\t\tthe smell, if there is such a \t\t\tthing.  I feel saturated by it.  I \t\t\tcan taste your stink and every \t\t\ttime I do, I fear that I've \t\t\tsomehow been infected by it.  \tHe wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips \tof his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.  \n[57]\t\t\tRepulsive, isn't it?  \tHe lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both \thands.  \n[58]\t\t\tI must get out of here, I must get \t\t\tfree.  In this mind is tlie key. \t\t\tMy key.  \tMorpheus sneers through his pain.  \n[59]\t\t\tOnce Zion is gone, there's no \t\t\tneed for me to be here.  Do you \t\t\tunderstand?  I need the codes.  I \t\t\thave to get inside Zion.  You have \t\t\tto tell me how.  \tHe begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.  \n[60]\t\t\tTell me!  Tell me!  \tThe skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown \tburst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.  \n[61]\t\t\tKnow what?  \tAgent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what \the is hearing.   \n[62]\t\t\tFind them and destroy them!  \tAgent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.   \n[63]\t\t\tNo.  \tThe GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a \tcacophony of CRASHING GLASS --  \tAs the Agents go for their weapons.  \tBut Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and \tBULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.  \tAgent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, \tblood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --  \tThen Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.  \tAnd finally Agent Jones.  \tNeo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.  \n[64]\t\t\tNooo!  \tHe FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a \tperfect line.  \tFor an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the \tWALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of \tchalk.  \tAnd as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet \tburies itself in his leg --  \tKnocking him off balance.  \n[65]\t\t\tThey're not out yet.   \n[66]\t\t\tYou're empty.  \tNeo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.  \n[67]\t\t\tYou can't win.  \n[68]\t\t\tDo you hear that, Mr. Anderson?  \tAgent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to \tlook down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a \thole in the darkness.  \n[69]\t\t\tThat is the sound of \t\t\tinevitability.  \tNeo sees it coming and he starts to fight.  \n[70]\t\t\tIt is the sound of your death.  \tThere is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as \tAgent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.  \n[71]\t\t\tGoodbye, Mr. Anderson.  \tThe TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.  \tThe veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the \tpain.  \tHe is not ready to die.  \n[72]\t\t\tCheck him.   \n[73]\t\t\tI told you, you couldn't win.   \n[74]\t\t\tNooooo!  \tAgent Smith pounds on the elevator door.   ", "Switch": "\n[1]\t\t\tWhat if he does?  \n[2]\t\t\tGod, I love that sound.   \n[3]\t\t\tOh God.  \tWearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the \tsilent bodies.  ", "Apoc": "\n[1]\t\t\tCome with me.  \tNeo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and \ttwo police officers rush in, drawing their guns.  \tApoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There \tis no upcoming station.  \tApoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles \tagainst its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo \tslams against the metal rail.  \tThe doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his \tbalance, Apoc shoves him backwards --  \tHe flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls \tfrom, the raised tracks --  \tHurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, \ta truck races under him and --  \tHe crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty \tboxes.   \n[2]\t\t\tAlmost.  \tHe and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex \tsystem of monitors, modules and drives.  \n[3]\t\t\tThat's right.  \n[4]\t\t\tStill nothing.  \tMorpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.  \n[5]\t\t\tTargeting... almost there.  \tAn ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.  \n[6]\t\t\tLock!  I got him!  \n[7]\t\t\tMorpheus is right.  He's got to be \t\t\tthe one.   \n[8]\t\t\tNo way.  Not possible.  \n[9]\t\t\tHe won't.  \n[10]\t\t\tWhat?!  ", "Neo": "\n[1] \tIt is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with \ttechnology.  \tWeed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into \tthickets that wind up and around the legs of several \tdesks.  \tTabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay \topen like an autopsied corpse.  \tWe turn towards the center of this rat-nest of \ttechnology, following the slurping and crunching of \tcereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --  \tNEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a \tcomputer than living outside one.  \n[2]\t\t\tFuckin' idiots don't know shit.  \tHe finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an \tanonynous message slices onto the screen.  \n[3]\t\t\tWhat the hell...  \n[4]\t\t\tWhat do you want, Anthony?  \n[5]\t\t\tYou got the money this time?  \tHe holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door. \tAnthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.  \n[6] \tThey watch from the window as the cops, silently, \trobotically, climb into their van.  \n[7]\t\t\tI don't know.  I have to work \t\t\ttomorrow.  \n[8]\t\t\tYeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.   \n[9]\t\t\tHow did you know that --  \n[10]\t\t\tWho are you?  \n[11]\t\t\tTrinity?  The Trinity?  The \t\t\tTrinity that cracked the I.R.S. \t\t\tKansas City D-Base?  \n[12]\t\t\tGee-zus.  \n[13]\t\t\tI just thought... you were a guy.  \n[14]\t\t\tDo you want to go sorewhere and \t\t\ttalk?  \n[15]\t\t\tThat was you on the board tonight. \t\t\tThat was your note, wasn't it?  \n[16]\t\t\tWho wouldn't?  \n[17]\t\t\tWhat?  Why?  \n[18]\t\t\tI don't understand --  \n[19]\t\t\tThe Matrix.  What is the Matrix?  \n[20]\t\t\tWait.  Who was it?  Who was the \t\t\tman?  \tShe leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she \twhispers.  \n[21] \tThe sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to \tconsciousness.  He strains to read the clock face: \n[22]\t\t\tShitshitshit.   \n[23]\t\t\tYes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly \t\t\tclear.  \n[24] \tThe entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a \tlabyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of \televators.  \tNeo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands \tup in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.  \n[25]\t\t\tIf I was late again, I'm going to \t\t\tbe fired.  \tHe smirks.  \n[26]\t\t\tYeah.  That's me.  \tNeo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him \tthe softpak.  \n[27]\t\t\tHello?  \n[28]\t\t\t... no.  \n[29]\t\t\tWho's coming for me?  \n[30]\t\t\tRight now?  \n[31]\t\t\tHoly fuckin' shit!  \n[32]\t\t\tWhat the fuck do they want with \t\t\tme?!  \n[33]\t\t\tHow?!  \n[34]\t\t\tBut what if...?  \n[35]\t\t\tHow do you know all this?  \tMorpheus laughs quietly.  \n[36]\t\t\tNo! It's too far away.  \n[37]\t\t\tNo way, no way, this is crazy.  \n[38]\t\t\tThis is insane!  Why is this \t\t\thappening to me?  What did I do? \t\t\tI'm nobody.  I didn't do anything. \t\t\tFuck! Fuck!  Fuck!  \tHe climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the \tframe, he steps onto the small ledge.  \tThe scaffold seems even farther away.  \n[39]\t\t\tI'm going to die.  \tThe WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, \tknocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to \tthe frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.  \tHe watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.  \n[40]\t\t\tThis is insane.  I can't do this! \t\t\tForget it!  \tHe climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the \tdoor.  \n[41]\t\t\tI didn't do anything!   \n[42]\t\t\tYeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a \t\t\treal good deal.  But I think I \t\t\thave a better one.  How about I \t\t\tgive you the finger --  \tHe does.  \n[43]\t\t\tAnd you can cram that file up your \t\t\tSecret Service sphincter.  \tAgent Smith puts his glasses back on.  \n[44]\t\t\tYou ain't seen nothing yet.  \n[45]\t\t\tYou can't scare me with this \t\t\tgestapo crap.  I know my rights. \t\t\tI want my phone call.  \tAgent Smith smiles.  \n[46] \tScreaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.  \tHe realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth \tis normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a \tdeep, everything-is-okay breath, when --  \tThe PHONE RINGS.  \tIt almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING, \tbuilding pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, \tsucking him in with an almost gravitational force.  \tHe answers it, saying nothing.  \n[47]\t\t\tThe agents --  \n[48]\t\t\t... Yes.  \n[49]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[50]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[51]\t\t\tJesus!  God!  \n[52]\t\t\tDo what?  \tThe instant he hears the word, he knows.  \n[53]\t\t\tOh, shit --  \tThe cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his \tchest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.  \n[54]\t\t\tIt's an honor.  \n[55]\t\t\tYou could say that.  \n[56]\t\t\tYou're Morpheus, you're a legend. \t\t\tMost hackers would die to meet \t\t\tyou.  \n[57]\t\t\tNo.  \n[58]\t\t\tBecause I don't like the idea that \t\t\tI'm not in control of my life.  \n[59]\t\t\tWhat gift?  \n[60]\t\t\tIt's not magic.  \n[61]\t\t\tFree from what?  \n[62]\t\t\tWhat truth?  \n[63]\t\t\tHow?  \n[64]\t\t\tApoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen \t\t\tVirus.  \n[65]\t\t\tA little.  \n[66]\t\t\tEssentially, it's a hardware \t\t\tsystem that uses an apparatus; \t\t\theadgear, gloves and whatever to \t\t\tmake you feel that you are in a \t\t\tcomputer program.  \n[67]\t\t\tYou might not, no.  \n[68]\t\t\tYou did all this?  \tShe nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. \tThey are wired to an old hotel phone.  \n[69]\t\t\tShit...  \tCypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent \tdata.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.  \tNeo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers \tdisappear beneath the rippling surface.  \tQuickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror \tstretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy \tstuck to his fingertips.  \n[70]\t\t\tWhat is this?  Mescaline?  \n[71]\t\t\tUh-oh...  \n[72]\t\t\tIt's cold.  \tThe mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, \ttipping his head as though he were sinking into the \tmirror, trying to keep his mouth up.  \n[73]\t\t\tIt's all over me --  \tMorpheus is right next to him, with the phone.  \n[74] \tNeo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us, \tangelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.   \n[75] \n[76]\t\t\t... am I dead?  \n[77] \tHe opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. \tHe focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of \tacupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.  \n[78]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[79]\t\t\tWhy do my eyes hurt?  \n[80] \tNeo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is \twearing a black tank top and shorts.  \tHe begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV \tplugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out, \tstaring at the grafted outlet.  \tHe feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the \tlarge outlet in the base of his skull.  \tJust as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the \tdoor.  \n[81]\t\t\tMorpheus, what's happened to me? \t\t\tWhat is this place?  \n[82]\t\t\tWhen?  \n[83]\t\t\tThat's not possible.  \n[84]\t\t\tHow?  \n[85]\t\t\tRight now, we're inside a computer \t\t\tprogram?  \n[86]\t\t\tThis isn't real?  \n[87]\t\t\tWhat happened?  \n[88]\t\t\tNo!  I don't believe it!  It's not \t\t\tpossible!  \n[89]\t\t\tStop!  Let me out!  I want out!   \n[90]\t\t\tGet this thing out of me!  \n[91]\t\t\tDon't touch me!  Get away from me!  \tOn his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. \tSweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull \tas if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.  \n[92] \tHe blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark. \tNeo is stretched out on his bed.  \n[93]\t\t\tI can't go back, can I?  \tMorpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far \tcorner.  \n[94]\t\t\tI told you I don't believe in \t\t\tfate.  \tMorpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.  \n[95]\t\t\tFor what?  \n[96] \tNeo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The \tdoor opens and TA.NK steps inside.  \n[97]\t\t\tNo.  \n[98]\t\t\tYou don't have...  \n[99]\t\t\tZion?  \n[100]\t\t\tJiujitsu?  I'm going to learn \t\t\tjujitsu?  \tTank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.  \n[101]\t\t\tNo way.  \tSmiling, Tank punches the \"load\" code.  \tHis body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp \tshut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds, \tadrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.  \tAn instant later his eyes snap open.  \n[102]\t\t\tHoly shit!  \n[103]\t\t\tHell yes!   \n[104]\t\t\tThis is incredible.  I know Kung \t\t\tFu.  \tMorpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to \tTank.  \n[105]\t\t\tYou -- You're too fast.  \n[106]\t\t\tI, uh... maybe.  \n[107]\t\t\tI feel better.  \n[108]\t\t\tShit.  \tNeo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at \tMorpheus an impossible fifty feet away.  \n[109]\t\t\tOkie dokie.  \tHe takes a deep breath.  \n[110]\t\t\tYeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No \t\t\tproblem.  \tHe concentrates.  Runs.   \n[111]\t\t\tI thought it wasn't real.  \tNeo stares at the blood.  \n[112]\t\t\tIf you are killed in the Matrix, \t\t\tyou die here?  \n[113] \tTrinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.  \n[114]\t\t\tSorry.  \n[115]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[116]\t\t\tIs that... ?  \n[117]\t\t\tJeez, I was wondering about that.  \n[118]\t\t\tWhy I was bald here but not in the \t\t\tMatrix.  \n[119]\t\t\tResidual self image.  \n[120]\t\t\tLife systems monitor, glucose \t\t\tlevels.  \n[121]\t\t\tMain power supply to the core.  \tHe follows Tank to the operator's station where he points \tto a red key-switch.  \n[122]\t\t\tMainframe self-destruct.  Uses all \t\t\tremaining power to generate an... \n[123]\t\t\tWhat's he talking about?  \n[124]\t\t\tSee who?  \n[125]\t\t\tDid you have to do this?  \n[126]\t\t\tWhat did she tell you?  \n[127]\t\t\tAny of them true?  \tTrinity looks at him, then looks away.  \n[128]\t\t\tThe agents.  They're sentient \t\t\tprograms.  They can commandeer any \t\t\tsoftware hardwired to the \t\t\tmainframe.  \n[129]\t\t\tThe best hacking is always \t\t\ttraceless.  \tCypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the \tperimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he \tsurreptitiously drops something inside.  \tIt is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as \tthe LINE CONNECTS.  \tAn early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a \tcorrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.   \n[130]\t\t\tWhat -- what happened?  \n[131]\t\t\tThere is no spoon.  Right.  \tHe concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the \tPriestess touches his shoulder.  \n[132]\t\t\tHello?  \tA DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up \tthe stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something \tcooking.  \tFollowing the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he \tfinds an open door.  \n[133]\t\t\tHello?  \n[134]\t\t\tYou're the Oracle?  \n[135]\t\t\tYeah.  \n[136]\t\t\tWhat vase?  \tHe turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from \tthe table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.  \n[137]\t\t\tShit, I'm sorry.  \tShe pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns. \tShe is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts, \tcomfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like \tsomeone's grandma.  \n[138]\t\t\tHow did you know...?  \tShe sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.  \n[139]\t\t\tWho?  \n[140]\t\t\tI think so.  \n[141]\t\t\tI don't know.  \tShe gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma \thas, except that the words are in Latin.  \n[142]\t\t\tWhat's the good news?  \n[143]\t\t\tIs that it, then?  \n[144]\t\t\tYou do?  \n[145]\t\t\tWhoa.  Deja vu.  \tThose words stop the others dead in their tracks.   \n[146]\t\t\tNothing.  Just had a little deja \t\t\tvu.  \n[147]\t\t\tA black cat went past us and then \t\t\tI saw another that looked just \t\t\tlike it.  \n[148]\t\t\tIt might have been.  I'm not sure.  \tTrinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the \trasping breath of the old building.  \n[149]\t\t\tWhat is it?  \n[150]\t\t\tI don't know.  It just went dead.  \tTrinity listens to the dead line and takes out the \tcellular.   \n[151]\t\t\tIt's Tank!  He's alive.  \tCypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head \toff.   \n[152]\t\t\tYeah.  Right.   \n[153]\t\t\tWhat are they doing to him?  \n[154]\t\t\tHow?  \n[155]\t\t\tHow much time?  \n[156]\t\t\tThe access codes to Zion.  \n[157]\t\t\tYou need help.  I'm coming with \t\t\tyou.  \n[158]\t\t\tMorpheus did what he did because \t\t\the believed that I'm something \t\t\tthat I'm not.  \n[159]\t\t\tI'm not the One, Trinity.  The \t\t\tOracle told me.  \tTrinity is stunned.  \n[160]\t\t\tShe said I had a gift but I still \t\t\thad a lot to learn.  She told me \t\t\tmaybe next life.  \n[161]\t\t\tWhy?  It wouldn't mean anything. \t\t\tHe'd still believe what he wanted \t\t\tto believe.  But Morpheus is the \t\t\tone that matters.  He's more \t\t\timportant than me and we both know \t\t\tit.  \tHe straps in.  \n[162]\t\t\tI may not be what Morpheus thinks \t\t\tI am, but if I don't try to help \t\t\thim, then I'm not even what I \t\t\tthink I am.  \n[163]\t\t\tHis friend.  \n[164]\t\t\tYeah?  \tHe snap cocks an Uzi.  \n[165]\t\t\tThat's why it's going to work.  \n[166]\t\t\tThere is no spoon.  \tNeo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower \tthan where they attached themselves.  \tBOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.  \tThe counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up \tthrough the shaft as --  \tThe elevator falls away beneath them, distending space, \tfilling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar \tto the top.   \n[167]\t\t\tTrinity!  \tAgent Jones charges.  \n[168]\t\t\t... help.  \tHis GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --  \tBullet-time.  \tThe AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo \ttwists, bends, ducks just between them.  \tAgent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS \tcoming faster until --  \tNeo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a \tspiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.  \tHe starts to scream as another digs a red groove across \this thigh.  \tHe has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent \tJones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final \ttime.  \tCLICK.  Empty.  \tNeo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house \tkick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels \tit at Neo.  \n[169]\t\t\tThanks.  \n[170]\t\t\tI'm fine.  \tNeo is already looking at the helicopter.  \n[171]\t\t\tCan you fly that thing?  \n[172]\t\t\tGet up, Morpheus!  Get up!  \tMorpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.  \tNeo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into \tthe adjoining room.  \tHe attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN \n[173]\t\t\tHe won't make it.  \tMorpheus lunges, out of control --  \tAs Neo spins, every move a whip crack --  \tSnapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.  \tMorpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the \twide blue empty space --  \tFlying for a moment.  \tThe rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord \tattached to a machine.  \tAs their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other \ton a seemingly magnetic course until --  \tThey collide.  \tAlmost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs, \tscrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, \tfinding hold and clinging.  \tUntil the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their \tfragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, \tfalling down --  \tThe ground deliriously distant --  \tAs Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed \twrist.  \n[174]\t\t\tGotcha!  \tTrinity is already pulling the copter up and away.  \tAs Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.  \tHe'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he \taims at something only he can see: the oil line.  \tPONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of \tholes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.  \n[175]\t\t\tOh fuck.  \tTrinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the \tnearest building.  \tMorpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the \tmachine above them begin to fall.  \tThe ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow \twhile --  \tThe Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching \tthe helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.  \tCarried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic \tfall over the nearest roof where --  \tNeo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope \tgoes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach \thimself but --  \tThe helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof \tlike a setting sun --  \tThe coils of slack snap taught --  \tYanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious \tspeed towards the edge even as --  \tTrinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand, \tgrabbing for the rope with the other --  \tNeo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us, \twhen his feet hit the rain gutter --  \tA fulcrum that levers him up just as --  \tTrinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER, \tfalling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a \tglass skyscraper.  \tHolding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who \tstands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath \thim as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --  \tShe bounces against a shatterproof window that spider- \tcracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.   \n[176]\t\t\tMorpheus, I know you won't believe \t\t\tme but the Oracle told ne I'm not \t\t\tthe One.  \n[177]\t\t\tDon't!  \tThe Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly \tover the turnstiles.  \n[178]\t\t\tGet outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!  \tThe Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban \tcave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and \tMorpheus arrive.  \n[179]\t\t\tIt was nobody.  \tNeo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.  \n[180]\t\t\tLet's go!  You first, Morpheus.  \tMorpheus gets in and answers the phone.  \tLost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as \tMorpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its \tcord.  \tHis eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.   \n[181]\t\t\tI believe...  \tHe stares at the fullness of her lips.  \n[182]\t\t\tI want to kiss you.  \tShe smiles.  \n[183]\t\t\tSo are you.  \tThe smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.  \n[184]\t\t\tI already have.  \tHe attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent \tseems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.  \tAnd this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an \tunrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.   \n[185]\t\t\tMy name is Neo.  \tImpossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith \tagainst the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.  \tThey fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES \tINTO the station.  \tNeo back-flips up off the tracks just as --  \tThe train barrels over Agent Smith.  \tNeo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its \temergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of \tTORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the \tstation.  \tNeo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the \tescalator --  \tAs the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last \tcar open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his \tglasses again intact.   \n[186]\t\t\tMr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out \t\t\tof here!   \n[187]\t\t\tHurry, Tank!  I got some serious \t\t\tpursuit!   \n[188]\t\t\tI'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.  \n[189]\t\t\tHi.  It's me.  I know you're out \t\t\tthere.  I know you're working as \t\t\tfast as you can to catch me.  \tWe CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering \tacross the screen.  \n[190]\t\t\tI thought I should call and let \t\t\tyou know how things stand.  \tWe DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the \tdarkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.  \n[191]\t\t\tI know you're real proud of this \t\t\tworld you've built, the way it \t\t\tworks, all the nice little rules \t\t\tand such, but I've got some bad \t\t\tnews.  \tWe realize that the constellation is actually the holes \tin the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.  \n[192]\t\t\tI've decided to make a few \t\t\tchanges.  \tWe SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.  \tHe steps out of the phone booth and starts walking, \twearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a \tmother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --  \tNeo takes off, flying up into the air.  ", "Cypher": "\n[1]\t\t\tLet's see.  Target left work at \n[2]\t\t\tHe caught the northbound Howard \t\t\tline. Got off at Sheridan. \t\t\tStopped at 7-11.  Purchased six- \t\t\tpack of beer and a box of Captain \t\t\tCrunch.  Returned home.  \tThe area code is identified.  The first three numbers \tsuddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.  \tWe begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each \tdigit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like \tthe wheels of a slot machine.  \n[3]\t\t\tDo you know when we're going to \t\t\tmake contact?  \n[4]\t\t\tJust between you and me, you don't \t\t\tbelieve it, do you?  You don't \t\t\tbelieve this guy is the one?  \n[5]\t\t\tI know.  But what about you?  \n[6]\t\t\tYeah, but if he's wrong --  \tThe final number pops into place --  \n[7]\t\t\tHear what?  \n[8]\t\t\tYeah, course I'm sure.  \tWe MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green \tnumbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.  \n[9]\t\t\tYeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.  \tShe hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the \tnetherworld of the computer screen.  \tWhere gradually the sound of a police radio grows around \tus.  \n[10]\t\t\tShit.  \n[11]\t\t\tMorpheus, I know what you believe \t\t\tbut I think this is a mistake. \t\t\tWe're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm \t\t\tafraid he might pop.  \n[12]\t\t\tI knew it, I knew it...  \n[13]\t\t\tHe's gonna pop!  \n[14]\t\t\tHe's going to pop!  \tVomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.   \n[15]\t\t\tEveryone falls, right, Trinity?  \tBut Trinity has left.  \tNeo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to \tmove and groans, cradling his ribs.  \tWhile Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.  \n[16]\t\t\tWhoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the \t\t\tbejeezus out of ne.  \n[17]\t\t\tNo, it's all right.  \n[18]\t\t\tMidnight watch.  \tNeo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens \tthat seem alive with a constant flow of data.  \n[19]\t\t\tThe Matrix?  Yeah.  \tThe monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.  \n[20]\t\t\tYou want a drink?  \tHe pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.  \n[21]\t\t\tI'll tell you, I feel for you, \t\t\tman.  I really do.  Most of us \t\t\twere still young, just punks, when \t\t\tMorpheus jacked us.  But you, you \t\t\thad a real life.  \tNeo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds \ton his back.  \n[22]\t\t\tGood shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. \t\t\tIt's good for two things: \t\t\tdegreasing engines and killing \t\t\tbrain cells.  \tRed-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.  \n[23]\t\t\tDid he tell you why he did it?  \tNeo nods.  \n[24]\t\t\tI'll be the didn't tell you that \t\t\tthis wasn't the first time he \t\t\tthought he found the One.  \tNeo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.  \n[25]\t\t\tLet me give you a piece of advice. \t\t\tBetween you and me, if Morpheus \t\t\tsays you can fly, I wouldn't go \t\t\tjumping out any windows to find \t\t\tout if he's right.  Understand?  \tCypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat- \tscorching mouthful.  \n[26]\t\t\tWelcome to the real world!   \n[27]\t\t\tThat's what he said to me nine \t\t\tyears ago.  \tThe meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing \tred juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.  \n[28]\t\t\tThe real world.  Ha, what a joke.  \tWe recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.  \n[29]\t\t\tYou know what real is?  I'll tell \t\t\tyou what real is.  \tA fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the \tface of Cypher.  \n[30]\t\t\tReal is just another four-letter \t\t\tword.  \tHe laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.  \tThe restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago \tskyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu \thas no prices.  \tSitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.  \n[31]\t\t\tMmm, so, so fucking good.  \tSmith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his \tmouth.  \n[32]\t\t\tYou know, I know that this steak \t\t\tdoesn't exist.  I know when I put \t\t\tit in my mouth, the Matrix is \t\t\ttelling my brain that it is juicy \t\t\tand delicious.  After nine years, \t\t\tdo you know what I've realized?  \tPausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He \tpops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef \tmelting in his mouth.  \n[33]\t\t\tIgnorance is bliss.  \n[34]\t\t\tI don't want to remember nothing. \t\t\tNothing!  You understand?  And I \t\t\twant to be rich.  Someone \t\t\timportant.  Like an actor.  You \t\t\tcan do that, right?  \n[35]\t\t\tAll right.  You get my body back \t\t\tin a power plant, reinsert me into \t\t\tthe Matrix and I'll get you what \t\t\tyou want.  \n[36]\t\t\tI told you, I don't know them. \t\t\tBut I can give you the man who \t\t\tdoes.  \n[37]\t\t\tThat's what they changed.  We're \t\t\ttrapped.  There's no way out.  \tThe sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the \tmechanical sureness of a vice.  \n[38]\t\t\tI need an exit!  Fast!  \n[39]\t\t\tThere was an accident.  A fucking \t\t\tcar accident.  All of a sudden. \t\t\tBoom.  They're all dead.  I still \t\t\tgot the shakes but, Jesus, \t\t\tsomeone's going to make a believer \t\t\tout of me.   \n[40]\t\t\tJust get me outta here.   \n[41]\t\t\tAn actor.  Definitely.   \n[42]\t\t\tGoddamn gas.  My lungs are killing \t\t\tme.  \tHe crosses to an overhead bin.  \n[43]\t\t\tWe got any pain killers?  \n[44]\t\t\tHello, Trinity.  \n[45]\t\t\tHe had an accident.  \n[46]\t\t\tYou know, for a long time, I \t\t\tthought I was in love with you, \t\t\tTrinity.  I used to dream about \t\t\tyou...  \tHe nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of \tit.  \n[47]\t\t\tYou are a beautiful woman.  Too \t\t\tbad things had to work out like \t\t\tthis.  \tWe INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main \tdeck.  \n[48]\t\t\tIn a way you're very lucky.  Most \t\t\tpeople never know why they die. \t\t\tOne minute they're alive, the next \t\t\tthey're dead.  No warning. \t\t\tNothing.  That's why I thought \t\t\tmaybe I should tell you.  It \t\t\tseemed the least I could do.  \tHe stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils \tup out of him.  \n[49]\t\t\tYou see, the truth, the real,truth \t\t\tis that the war is over.  It's \t\t\tbeen over for a long time.  And \t\t\tguess what?  We lost!  Did you \t\t\thear that?  We lost the war!  \n[50]\t\t\tZion?  Zion is a part of this \t\t\tdelusion.  More of this madness. \t\t\tThat's why this has to be done. \t\t\tIt has to end.  Now and forever.  \tShe suddenly sees the entire dark plan.  \n[51]\t\t\tYou see, Trinity, we humans have a \t\t\tplace in the future.  But it's not \t\t\there.  It's in the Matrix.  \n[52]\t\t\tOh, I disagree, Trinity.  I \t\t\tdisagree.  I think the Matrix is \t\t\tmore real than this world.  I \t\t\tmean, all I do is pull a plug \t\t\there.  But there, you watch a man \t\t\tdie.  \tHe grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and \tyanks it out.  \n[53]\t\t\tYou tell me which is more real.  \tApoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in \this throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then \tfalls dead.  Switch screams.  \n[54]\t\t\tWelcome to the real world, right?  \tHe laughs.  \n[55]\t\t\tPay for it?  I'm not even going to \t\t\tremember it.  It'll be like it \t\t\tnever happened.  The tree falling \t\t\tin the forest.  It doesn't make a \t\t\tsound.  \tHis hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes \thold of her plug.  \tShe suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she \tis murdered.  \n[56]\t\t\tDon't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just \t\t\tthe messenger.  And right now I'm \t\t\tgoing to prove that the message is \t\t\ttrue.  \tHe stands over Neo.  \n[57]\t\t\tIf Morpheus was right, then \t\t\tthere's no way I can pull this \t\t\tplug, is there?  \tShe turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is \tnext.  \n[58]\t\t\tIf he is the One, then in the next \t\t\tfew seconds there has to be some \t\t\tkind of miracle to stop me. \t\t\tBecause if he dies like the others \t\t\tthat means Morpheus was wrong. \t\t\tHow can he be the One if he's \t\t\tdead?  \tHe takes hold of the cord when --  \tShe hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.  \tCypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the \tknee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and \tthe sights of the plasma rifle.  ", "Brown": "\n[1]\t\t\tWhere are they?   \n[2]\t\t\tPerhaps we are asking the wrong \t\t\tquestions.  \n[3]\t\t\tHow?  \n[4]\t\t\tWhat were you doing?  \tAgent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.  \n[5]\t\t\tThey are actually attacking.   \n[6]\t\t\tThe trace was completed.  \n[7]\t\t\tThe extermination unit is in \t\t\tplace.  \n[8]\t\t\tHe's gone.  \tAgent Smith smiles, standing over him.  ", "Trinity": "\n[1] \n[2]\t\t\tAll right, you're relieved.  Use \t\t\tthe usual exit.  \n[3]\t\t\tSoon.  \tOnly two thin digits left.  \n[4]\t\t\tI think Morpheus believes he is.  \n[5]\t\t\tI think Morpheus knows things that \t\t\tI don't.  \n[6]\t\t\tDid you hear that?  \n[7]\t\t\tAre you sure this line is clean?  \n[8]\t\t\tI better go.  \n[9]\t\t\tShit.   \n[10]\t\t\tMorpheus!  The link was traced!  I \t\t\tdon't know how.  \n[11]\t\t\tAre there any agents?  \n[12]\t\t\tGoddamnit!  \n[13]\t\t\tAll right --  \n[14]\t\t\tGet up, Trinity.  You're fine. \t\t\tGet up -- just get up!  \tShe stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.   \n[15]\t\t\tHello, Neo.  \n[16]\t\t\tI know a lot about you.  I've been \t\t\twanting to meet you for some time.  \n[17]\t\t\tMy name is Trinity.  \n[18]\t\t\tThat was a long time ago.  \n[19]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[20]\t\t\tMost guys do.  \tNeo is a little embarrassed.  \n[21]\t\t\tNo.  It's safe here and I don't \t\t\thave much time.  \tThe MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking \tdirectly into each other's ear.  \n[22]\t\t\tI had to gamble that you would see \t\t\tand they wouldn't.  \n[23]\t\t\tI can't explain everything to you. \t\t\tI'm sure that it's all going to \t\t\tseem very strange, but I brought \t\t\tyou here to warn you, Neo.  You \t\t\tare in a lot of danger.  \n[24]\t\t\tThey're watching you.  Something \t\t\thappened and they found out about \t\t\tyou.  Normally, if our target is \t\t\texposed we let it go.  But this \t\t\ttime, we can't do that.  \n[25]\t\t\tYou came here because you wanted \t\t\tto know the answer to a hacker's \t\t\tquestion.  \n[26]\t\t\tTwelve years ago I met a man, a \t\t\tgreat man, who said that no one \t\t\tcould be told the answer to that \t\t\tquestion.  That they had to see \t\t\tit, to believe it.  \tHer body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.  \n[27]\t\t\tHe told me that no one should look \t\t\tfor the answer unless they have to \t\t\tbecause once you see it, \t\t\teverything changes.  Your life and \t\t\tthe world you live in will never \t\t\tbe the same.  It's as if you wake \t\t\tup one morning and the sky is \t\t\tfalling.  \tThere is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels \tthe words like a drug, seeping into him.  \n[28]\t\t\tThe truth is out there, Neo.  It's \t\t\tlooking for you and it will find \t\t\tyou, if you want it to.  \tShe takes hold of him with her eyes.  \n[29]\t\t\tThat's all I can tell you right \t\t\tnow.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good \t\t\tluck.  \n[30]\t\t\tYou know who.  \tShe turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall \tof bodies.  \tA SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music, \tpressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --  \n[31]\t\t\tShit.  \n[32]\t\t\tWe got him.  Call the chop-shop.  \tShe hangs up.  \n[33]\t\t\tListen to me, Neo.  You have to, \t\t\ttrust us.  \tShe tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches \tfor his face.  \n[34]\t\t\tThis has to be done for your \t\t\tprotection and ours.  \tShe seals his eyes shut with the tape.  \n[35]\t\t\tYou can't understand right now, \t\t\tbut if you're not one of us, \t\t\tyou're one of them.   \n[36]\t\t\tHello, Gizmo.  \tNeo hears the voices around him.  \n[37]\t\t\tYeah.  \n[38]\t\t\tAre you going to help us or aren't \t\t\tyou?  \n[39]\t\t\tWe think you're bugged.  We can't \t\t\ttake you to Morpheus until you're \t\t\tclean.  \n[40]\t\t\tWhat's happening?  \n[41]\t\t\tDo something!  \n[42]\t\t\tAre you crazy?  That will kill \t\t\thim.  \tWe watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.  \n[43]\t\t\tClear.  \n[44]\t\t\tNeo, are you okay?  \tHe nods.  \n[45]\t\t\tIt's over.  We got it.  \tHanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire- \ttap.  \n[46]\t\t\tThanks for your help, Gizmo.  \n[47]\t\t\tGizmo, you don't have the hardware \t\t\tto handle this software.  \tHe howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away. \tTrinity turns to Neo.  \n[48]\t\t\tLet's go.  He's waiting.   \n[49]\t\t\tThis is it.  \tNeo can hear his own heart pounding.  \n[50]\t\t\tLet me give one piece of advice. \t\t\tBe honest.  He knows more than you \t\t\tcan possibly imagine.   \n[51]\t\t\tI knew he would.  \tCypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone \taway from, Neo.  \n[52]\t\t\tIt's going into replication.  \n[53]\t\t\tI got a fibrillation!  \n[54]\t\t\tHe's going into arrest!  \n[55]\t\t\tFar from it.  \n[56]\t\t\tEasy, Neo.  Easy.  \tDozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out, \the tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the \tharness.  \n[57]\t\t\tCome on.   \n[58]\t\t\tNeo, I saved you some dinner --  \tShe sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray \tdown and pulls the blanket over him.  \tShe pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, \tbreathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.  \tIt seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a \tstart, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets \tout of bed.   \n[59]\t\t\tYeah.  \n[60]\t\t\tLots of things.  \n[61]\t\t\tSome of them.  \n[62]\t\t\tThere's no point in worrylng. \t\t\tWhatever is going to happen is \t\t\tgoing to happen.  \tThey cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the \tdoors.  \n[63]\t\t\tHere they come.   \n[64]\t\t\tWhat did you just say?  \n[65]\t\t\tWhat happened?  What did you see?  \n[66]\t\t\tHow much like it?  Was it the same \t\t\tcat?  \n[67]\t\t\tA deja vu is usually a glitch in \t\t\tthe Matrix.  It happens when they \t\t\tchange something.  \tShe also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER \tBLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.   \n[68]\t\t\tOh, God.   \n[69]\t\t\tThey'll be able to track it.  \n[70]\t\t\tMorpheus, don't --  \n[71]\t\t\tWe need a phone.   \n[72]\t\t\tTank, it's me.   \n[73]\t\t\tWe need an exit!  \n[74]\t\t\tCypher, I thought --  \n[75]\t\t\tGot it.  \tShe hangs up.   \n[76]\t\t\tYou first,.Neo.  \tNeo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no \tsignal.  Nothing but silence.  \n[77]\t\t\tWhat happened?  \n[78]\t\t\tCypher?  Where's Tank?  \n[79]\t\t\tAn accident?  What about Dozer? \t\t\tIs Dozer there?   \n[80]\t\t\tYou killed them.  \n[81]\t\t\tWhat about Zion?  \n[82]\t\t\tOh rny God.  This is abzut Zion. \t\t\tYou gave them Morpheus for the \t\t\taccess codes to Zion.  \tCypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to \tApoc's body.  \n[83]\t\t\tThe Matrix isn't real!  \n[84]\t\t\tSomehow, some way, you're going to \t\t\tpay for this.  \n[85]\t\t\tGoddamn you, Cypher!  \n[86]\t\t\tWe should, we should hurry.  \n[87]\t\t\tTank, you're hurt.  \n[88]\t\t\tDozer?  \tTank's face tightens.  \n[89]\t\t\tI'm sorry, Tank.   \n[90]\t\t\tGoddamnit!  Goddamnit!  \n[91]\t\t\tNo!  \n[92]\t\t\tI'm going in after him.  \n[93]\t\t\tIf he does I'm sure you'll do what \t\t\thas to be done.  \n[94]\t\t\tNo.  No, I don't think you do.  If \t\t\tyou did, then you would know that \t\t\tI'm not letting him go.  Not \t\t\twithout a fight, Tank.  \tShe yanks her harness tight.  \n[95]\t\t\tNot without a fight.   \n[96]\t\t\tWhat do you think you're doing?  \n[97]\t\t\tNo.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed \t\t\thimself so you could escape. \t\t\tThere's no way you're going back \t\t\tin.  \n[98]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[99]\t\t\tDid you tell Morpheus?  \n[100]\t\t\tWhat are you?  \n[101]\t\t\tGuns.  Lots of guns.  \n[102]\t\t\tNo one has ever done anything like \t\t\tthis.  \n[103]\t\t\tDodge this, motherfucker!  \tBOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of \tmercurial light and when it hits the ground --  \tIt is the pilot.  \tTrinity helps Neo up.  \n[104]\t\t\tYou're hit --  \n[105]\t\t\tNot yet.  \tShe pulls out a cellular phone.   \n[106]\t\t\tTank, I need a pilot program for a \t\t\tmilitary M-109 helicopter.  \tTank is immediately searching the disk drawers.  \n[107]\t\t\tHurry!  \tHis fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding \tone that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive, \tpunching the \"load\" cormands on her keyboard.   \n[108]\t\t\tLet's go.   \n[109]\t\t\tShit-shit-no!  \tNeo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the \n[110]\t\t\tMorpheus!  \tShe runs at him, throwing her arms around him.  \n[111]\t\t\tTank, get us out of here.  \n[112]\t\t\tSee ya soon.  \tLINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.  \n[113]\t\t\tWhat happened?  Was that --  \n[114]\t\t\tMorpheus is right, you know.  It \t\t\tdoesn't matter what he believes or \t\t\teven what the Oracle believes. \t\t\tWhat matters is what you believe.  \n[115]\t\t\tI want to kiss you too...  \tThe PHONE begins to RING.  \n[116]\t\t\tBut I want it to be real.  \tShe pulls herself away and gets into the booth when \tsomething catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old \tMan had been.  \tShe hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if \tformed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of \tmetal.  \tThe GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through \tthe plastic WINDOW just as --  \tTrinity disappears.  \tThe handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, \tSHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.   \n[117]\t\t\tNeo!  \n[118]\t\t\tAn Agent!  You have to send me \t\t\tback!  \n[119]\t\t\tJesus, he's killing him!   \n[120]\t\t\tSend me back, Tank!  Anywhere!  \n[121]\t\t\tWhat is it... oh no.  \tIn every pipe surrounding them, they see the \tExtermination Unit.  \n[122]\t\t\tSentinels.   \n[123]\t\t\tYou can't use that until Neo is \t\t\tout!  \n[124]\t\t\tNeo, you better get your ass back \t\t\there!   \n[125]\t\t\tWhere is he?  \n[126]\t\t\tHurry, Neo.   \n[127]\t\t\tNo-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead! \t\t\tYou can't be dead!   \n[128]\t\t\tYou're right here.  I'm holding \t\t\tyou, Neo.  I'm not letting you go. \t\t\tDo you hear me?  I won't let you \t\t\tgo.   \n[129]\t\t\tGoddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up! \t\t\tNot now!  \tShe pounds on his chest.  \n[130]\t\t\tNot now!   \n[131]\t\t\tNow get up!   \n[132]\t\t\tNow!  \tHe turns the key.   \n[133]\t\t\tNeo?  \tHis eyes open.

I \t\t\tsee why she likes you.  \n[9]\t\t\tNot too bright, though.  \tShe winks.  \n[10]\t\t\tYou know why Morpheus brought you \t\t\tto see me?  \n[11]\t\t\tSo? What do you think?  You think \t\t\tyou're the one?  \n[12]\t\t\tYou know what that means?  It's \t\t\tLatin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'  \tShe puts her cigarette down.  \n[13]\t\t\tWell, let's have a look at you.  \tShe widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the \tglands in his neck.  \n[14]\t\t\tOpen your mouth.

There is a \t\t\tphone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can \t\t\tmake it.  \tShe takes a deep breath, centering herself.  \n[4]\t\t\tGo.  \tShe drops the phone.   \n[5]\t\t\tHello, Neo.

A female employee turns and \tpoints out Neo's cubicle.  \tNeo ducks.  \n[11]\t\t\tYes.  \tOne cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the \tagents.  \n[12]\t\t\tI'm not sure.  But, if you don't \t\t\twant to find out, you better get \t\t\tout of there.  \n[13]\t\t\tI can guide you out, but you have \t\t\tto do exactly what I say.  \tThe agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.  \n[14]\t\t\tThe cubicle across from you is \t\t\tempty.  \n[15]\t\t\tGo!

A cop is sent to \tsearch the bathroom.  \tMorpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.  \n[17]\t\t\tA little longer...  \tBrown is talking to the tall employee.  \n[18]\t\t\tWhen I tell you, go to the end of \t\t\tthe row to the first office on the \t\t\tleft, stay.as low as you can.  \tSweat trickles down his forehead.  \n[19]\t\t\tNow.  \tNeo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he \tfreezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.  \tStaying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING \tacross the opening to the first office on the left.  \tThe room is empty.  \n[20]\t\t\tGood.  Now there is a window. \t\t\tOpen it.  \n[21]\t\t\tThe answer is coming, Neo.  \tHe opens the window.  The window howls into the room.  \n[22]\t\t\tOutside, there's a scaffold.  You \t\t\tcan use it to get to the roof.  \tLeaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is \tseveral offices away.  \n[23]\t\t\tThere's a small ledge.  It's a \t\t\tshort climb.  You can make it.  \tNeo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a \tconcrete chasm.  \n[24]\t\t\tDon't be controlled by your fear, \t\t\tNeo.  There are only two ways out \t\t\tof this building.  One is that \t\t\tscaffold.  The other is in their \t\t\tcustody.  You take a chance either \t\t\tway.  I leave it to you.  \tCLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at \tthe scaffold.  \n[25]\t\t\tThis line is tapped, so I must be \t\t\tbrief.  \n[26]\t\t\tThey got to you first, but they've \t\t\tunderestimated how important you \t\t\tare.

He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.   \n[30]\t\t\tAt last.  \tHe wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible \tbehind circular mirrored glasses.  \tHe strides to Neo and they shake hands.  \n[31]\t\t\tWelcome, Neo.  As you no doubt \t\t\thave guessed, I am Morpheus.  \n[32]\t\t\tPlease.  Come.  Sit.  \tHe nods to Trinity.  \n[33]\t\t\tThank you, Trinity.  \tShe bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an \tadjacent room.  \tThey sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- \tleather chairs.  \n[34]\t\t\tI imagine, right now, you must be \t\t\tfeeling a bit like Alice, tumbling \t\t\tdown the rabbit hole?  \n[35]\t\t\tI can see it in your eyes.  You \t\t\thave the look of a man who accepts \t\t\twhat he sees because he is \t\t\texpecting to wake up.  \tA smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.  \n[36]\t\t\tIronically, this is not far from \t\t\tthe truth.  But I'm getting ahead \t\t\tof myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, \t\t\twhy are you here?  \n[37]\t\t\tYes.  Thank you.  But I think we \t\t\tboth know there's more to it than \t\t\tthat.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?  \n[38]\t\t\tWhy not?  \n[39]\t\t\tI know exactly what you mean.  \tAgain, that smile that could cut glass.  \n[40]\t\t\tLet me tell you why you are here. \t\t\tYou are here because you have the \t\t\tgift.  \n[41]\t\t\tI've watched you, Neo.  You do not \t\t\tuse a computer like a tool.  You \t\t\tuse it like it was part of \t\t\tyourself.  What you can do inside \t\t\ta computer is not normal.  I know. \t\t\tI've seen it.  What you do is \t\t\tmagic.  \tNeo shrugs.  \n[42]\t\t\tBut it is, Neo.  It is.  How else \t\t\twould you describe what has been \t\t\thappening to you?  \tHe leans forward.  \n[43]\t\t\tWe are trained in this world to \t\t\taccept only what is rational and \t\t\tlogical.  Have you ever wondered \t\t\twhy?  \tNeo shakes his head.  \n[44]\t\t\tAs children, we do not separate \t\t\tthe possible from the impossible \t\t\twhich is why the younger a mind is \t\t\tthe easier it is to free while a \t\t\tmind like yours can be very \t\t\tdifficult.  \n[45]\t\t\tFrom the Matrix.  \tNeo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of \thimself.  \n[46]\t\t\tDo you want to know what it is, \t\t\tNeo?  \tNeo swallows and nods his head.  \n[47]\t\t\tIt's that feeling you have had all \t\t\tyour life.  That feeling that \t\t\tsomething was wrong with the \t\t\tworld.  You don't know what it is \t\t\tbut it's there, like a splinter in \t\t\tyour mind, driving you mad, \t\t\tdriving you to me.  But what is \t\t\tit?  \tThe LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.  \n[48]\t\t\tThe Matrix is everywhere, it's all \t\t\taround us, here even in this room. \t\t\tYou can see it out your window, or \t\t\ton your television.  You feel it \t\t\twhen you go to work, or go to \t\t\tchurch or pay your taxes.  It is \t\t\tthe world that has been pulled \t\t\tover your eyes to blind you from \t\t\tthe truth.  \n[49]\t\t\tThat you are a slave, Neo.  That \t\t\tyou, like everyone else, was born \t\t\tinto bondage... \t\t\t... kept inside a prison that you \t\t\tcannot smell, taste, or touch.  A \t\t\tprison for your mind.  \tOutside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.  \n[50]\t\t\tUnfortunately, no one can be told \t\t\twhat the Matrix is.  You have to \t\t\tsee it for yourself.  \n[51]\t\t\tHold out your hands.  \tIn Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.  \n[52]\t\t\tThis is your last chance.  After \t\t\tthis, there is no going back.  \tIn his left, a blue pill.  \n[53]\t\t\tYou take the blue pill and the \t\t\tstory ends.  You wake in your bed \t\t\tand you believe whatever you want \t\t\tto believe.  \tThe pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.  \n[54]\t\t\tYou take the red pill and you stay \t\t\tin Wonderland and I show you how \t\t\tdeep the rabbit-hole goes.  \tNeo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the \tmoisture growing in his palms.  \n[55]\t\t\tRemember that all I am offering is \t\t\tthe truth.  Nothing more.  \tNeo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The \tCheshire smile returns.  \n[56]\t\t\tFollow me.  \tHe leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with \thigh-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green \tfrom the racks of monitors.  \tTrinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.  \n[57]\t\t\tHaven't I always told you, Cypher, \t\t\tnot to let fear control your life. \t\t\tApoc, are we on-line?  \tNeo recognizes the large man from the El train.  \n[58]\t\t\tNeo, time is always against us. \t\t\tWill you take a seat there?  \tIn the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair \tis an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.  \n[59]\t\t\tI imagine you know sonething about \t\t\tvirtual reality.  \tNeo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode \tdisks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.  \n[60]\t\t\tTell me about it.  \n[61]\t\t\tIf the virtual reality apparatus, \t\t\tas you called it, was wired to all \t\t\tof your senses and controlled them \t\t\tcompletely, would you be able to \t\t\ttell the difference between the \t\t\tvirtual world and the real world?  \n[62]\t\t\tNo, you wouldn't.  \tNeo whispers to Trinity.  \n[63]\t\t\tThe pill you took is part of a \t\t\ttrace program.  It's going to make \t\t\tthings feel a bit strange.  \tDistantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING \ton a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and \ttwitch when he notices the mirror.  \tWide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a \twebwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the \tmirror were becoming liquid.  \n[64]\t\t\tJust relax, Neo.  \tThe strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, \tuntil the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.  \tWith the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes \tof electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and \tfade.  \tHe looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored \ticicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running \tlike wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms \twhere he sees his face reflected.  \n[65]\t\t\tApoc?  \n[66]\t\t\tTank, we're going to need the \t\t\tsignal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.  \tThe mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up \this arns like hundreds of insects.  \n[67]\t\t\tShit!  Apoc?  \tStreams of mercury run from Neo's nose.  \n[68]\t\t\tNow, Tank now!  \tHis eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a \thigh-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --  \tIt is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to \tanother computer --  \tNeo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were \tpulled into the holes of the phone  \tSucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.   \n[69]\t\t\tWelcome to the real world, Neo.  \tNeo passes out.  \n[70]\t\t\tI know.  \tDozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.  \n[71]\t\t\tYour muscles have atrophied. \t\t\tWe're rebuilding them.  \tFluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.  \n[72]\t\t\tYou've never used them before.  \tMorpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo. \tNeo lays back.  \n[73]\t\t\tRest, Neo.  The answers are \t\t\tcoming.   \n[74]\t\t\tMore important than what is when?  \n[75]\t\t\tYou believe the year is 1997 when \t\t\tin fact it is much closer to 2197. \t\t\tI can't say for certain what year \t\t\tit is because we honestly do not \t\t\tknow.  \tThe wind is knocked from Neo's chest.  \n[76]\t\t\tI promised you the truth, Neo, and \t\t\tthe truth is that the world you \t\t\twere living in was a lie.  \n[77]\t\t\tI'll show you.   \n[78]\t\t\tThis is my ship, the \t\t\tNebuchadnezzar.  It's a \t\t\thovercraft.  Small like a \t\t\tsubmarine.  It's dark.  It's \t\t\tcramped and cold.  But it's home.  \tThey climb a ladder up to the main deck.   \n[79]\t\t\tThis is the main deck.  You know \t\t\tmost of my crew.  \tTrinity smiles and nods.  \n[80]\t\t\tThe ones you don't know.  That's \t\t\tMouse and Switch.  The two big \t\t\tguys are Tank and Dozer.  \tThe names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.  \n[81]\t\t\tAnd this, this is the Core.  This \t\t\tis where we broadcast our pirate \t\t\tsignal and hack into the Matrix.  \tIt is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of \tcoaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic \tbattery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks \tof little systems and computer monitors.  \tAt the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton \tchairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.  \tNear the circle of chairs is the control console and \toperator's station where the network is monitored.  \n[82]\t\t\tHelp him, Trinity.  \tNeo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.  \n[83]\t\t\tDo you remember when I asked you \t\t\tabout an apparatus that could turn \t\t\ta virtual reality into reality?  \tNeo nods.  \n[84]\t\t\tIt's right here.  \tHe touches Neo's head.  \n[85]\t\t\tAnd it's accessed here.  \tNeo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack \tat the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of \tcerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.  \n[86]\t\t\tThis will feel a little weird.  \tThere are several disturbing NOISES as he works the \tneedle in.  \tWe MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens \tinto a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop \tlike when you equalize them underwater.  \tHe relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling \tof weightlessness inside another place --   \n[87]\t\t\tThis is the Construct.  \tStartled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the \troom with him.  \n[88]\t\t\tIt is our loading program.  We can \t\t\tload anything from clothes, to \t\t\tweapons, to training simulations. \t\t\tAnything we need.  \tMorpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the \ttwo leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a \tlarge-screen television.  \n[89]\t\t\tSit down.  \tNeo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.  \n[90]\t\t\tWild, isn't it?  \tNeo's hands run over the cracked leather.  \n[91]\t\t\tWhat is real?  How do you define \t\t\treal?  If you're talking about \t\t\tyour senses, what you feel, taste, \t\t\tsmell, or see, then all you're \t\t\ttalking about are electrical \t\t\tsignals interpreted by your brain.  \tHe picks up a remote control and clicks ON the \tTELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.  \n[92]\t\t\tThis is the Chicago you know. \t\t\tChicago as it was at the end of \t\t\tthe twentieth century.  This \t\t\tChicago exists only as part of a \t\t\tneural-interactive simulation that \t\t\twe call the Matrix.  \tWe GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.  \n[93]\t\t\tYou have been living inside \t\t\tBaulliaurd's vision, inside the \t\t\tmap, not the territory.  This is \t\t\tChicago as it exists today.  \tThe sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The \tearth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out \tbeneath us as we ENTER the television.  \n[94]\t\t\t'The desert of the real.'  \tIn the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago \tprotruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of \ta long-dead corpse.  \n[95]\t\t\tWe are, right now, miles below the \t\t\tearth's surface.  The only place \t\t\thumans can survive outside the \t\t\tMatrix is underground.  \tStill MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the \tchairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. \tDizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.  \n[96]\t\t\tIt started early in the twenty- \t\t\tfirst century, with the birth of \t\t\tartificial intelligence, a \t\t\tsingular consciousness that \t\t\tspawned an entire race of \t\t\tmachines.  \tIn his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.  \n[97]\t\t\tAt first all they wanted was to be \t\t\ttreated as equals, entitled to the \t\t\tsame human inalienable rights. \t\t\tWhatever they were given, it was \t\t\tnot enough.  \tIn the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light \tup a bloody battle field.  \n[98]\t\t\tWe don't know who struck first. \t\t\tUs or them.  But sometime at the \t\t\tend of the twenty-first century \t\t\tthe battle was joined.  \tWe MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.  \n[99]\t\t\tThe war raged for generations and \t\t\tturned the face of our planet from \t\t\tgreen and blue to black and red.  \tAt last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are \tat once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic \tarchitecture like a microbiotic organism, that is \tperpetually in motion.  \tThe Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, \tsplitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.  \n[100]\t\t\tIt scorched and burned the sky. \t\t\tWithout the sun, the machines \t\t\tsought out a new energy source to \t\t\tsurvive.  \tThe Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink \tbursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud \tof stain.  \n[101]\t\t\tThey discovered a new form of \t\t\tfusion.  All that was required to \t\t\tinitiate the reaction was a small \t\t\telectric charge.  Throughout human \t\t\thistory we have been dependent on \t\t\tmachines to survive.  Fate, it \t\t\tseems, is not without a sense of \t\t\tirony.  \tWe return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where \twe see human beings looking almost blissful in their \tgelatin cocoons.  \n[102]\t\t\tThe human body generates more bio- \t\t\telectricity than a 120-volt \t\t\tbattery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s \t\t\tof body heat.  \tOutside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a \tbreathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.  \n[103]\t\t\tWe are, as an energy source, \t\t\teasily renewable and completely \t\t\trecyclable, the dead liquified and \t\t\tfed intravenously to the living.  \tHuge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.  \n[104]\t\t\tAll they needed to control this \t\t\tnew battery was something to \t\t\toccupy our mind.  \tWe see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous \tfluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already \tgrowing around the brain-jack.  \n[105]\t\t\tAnd so they built a prison out of \t\t\tour past, wired it to our brains \t\t\tand turned us into slaves.  \tWe PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television \tand we are again inside the white space of the Construct.  \n[106]\t\t\tI didn't say that it would be \t\t\teasy, Neo.  I just said that it \t\t\twould be the truth.  \tThe room without walls begins to spin.  \n[107]\t\t\tNo.  But if you could, would you \t\t\treally want to?  \tNeo isn't sure of that answer.  \n[108]\t\t\tI feel that I owe you an apology. \t\t\tThere is a rule that we do not \t\t\tfree a mind once it reaches a \t\t\tcertain age.  It is dangerous. \t\t\tThey have trouble letting go.. \t\t\tTheir mind turns against them. \t\t\tI've seen it happen.  I broke the \t\t\trule because I had to.  \tHe stares into the darkness, confessing as much to \thimself as Neo.  \n[109]\t\t\tWhen the Matrix was first built \t\t\tthere was a man born inside that \t\t\thad the ability to change what he \t\t\twanted, to remake the Matrix as he \t\t\tsaw fit.  It was this man that \t\t\tfreed the first of us and taught \t\t\tus the secret of the war; control \t\t\tthe Matrix and you control the \t\t\tfuture.  \tHe pauses.  \n[110]\t\t\tWhen he died, the Oracle at the \t\t\ttemple of Zion prophesied his \t\t\treturn and envisioned an end to \t\t\tthe war and freedom for our \t\t\tpeople.  That is why there are \t\t\tthose of us that have spent our \t\t\tentire lives searching the Matrix, \t\t\tlooking for him.  \tNeo can feel his eyes on him.  \n[111]\t\t\tI did what I did, because I \t\t\tbelieve we have been brought here \t\t\tfor a reason, Neo.  You are here \t\t\tto serve a purpose, just as I am \t\t\there to serve mine.  \n[112]\t\t\tBut I do, Neo.  I do.  \tHe stands up.  \n[113]\t\t\tGet some rest.  You're going to \t\t\tneed it.  \n[114]\t\t\tYour training.    \n[115]\t\t\tHow is he?  \tTank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.  \n[116]\t\t\tShow me.   \n[117]\t\t\tThis is a sparring program, \t\t\tsimilar to the programmed reality \t\t\tof the Matrix.  Consider this your \t\t\tfirst lesson.  \tHe assumes a fighting stance.  \n[118]\t\t\tAttack me.  \tNeo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until \the gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.  \tIt is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and \tfeet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack \t--  \tBut each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.   \n[119]\t\t\tGood.  Adaption.  Improvisation. \t\t\tBut your weakness isn't your \t\t\ttechnique.  \tMorpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. \tHis feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For \tevery blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --  \tNeo falls.  \tPanting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his \tmouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.  \n[120]\t\t\tHow did I beat you?  \n[121]\t\t\tDo you think my being faster, \t\t\tstronger has anything to do with \t\t\tmy muscles in this place?  \tNeo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.  \n[122]\t\t\tDo you believe that's air you are \t\t\tbreathing now?  \tNeo squints at him.  \n[123]\t\t\tIf you can free your mind, the \t\t\tbody will follow.  \tNeo stands, nodding.  \n[124]\t\t\tAgain.  \tTheir fists fly with  pneumatic speed.   \n[125]\t\t\tYou are angry with me.  \tNeo pants.  \n[126]\t\t\tIt's all right.  It's natural.  \n[127]\t\t\tGood, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo, \t\t\tbut it's a heavy one.  \tMorpheus smiles.  \n[128]\t\t\tTank, load the jump program.  \tNeo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain \tlifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building \trooftop in a city skyline.  \n[129]\t\t\tYou have to learn to let go of \t\t\tthat anger.  You must let go of \t\t\teverything.  \tA WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.  \n[130]\t\t\tYou must empty yourself to free \t\t\tyour mind.  \tMorpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. \tAnd jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing \tout behind him like a cape --  \tSomersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the \tstreet.  \n[131]\t\t\tEveryone falls the first time.  \tNeo nods quietly.  \n[132]\t\t\tIf you never know failure, how can \t\t\tyou know success?   \n[133]\t\t\tThe body cannot live without the \t\t\tmind.   \n[134]\t\t\tHow's he doing?  \n[135]\t\t\tGood.  I want everyone alerted to \t\t\t12-hour stand-by.  We're going in. \t\t\tNeo, it's time for you to know why \t\t\tyou're here.  \tMorpheus walks away.  \n[136]\t\t\tWe're in.  \tHe hangs up.  \n[137]\t\t\tMouse and Cable hold the exit. \t\t\tLet's go.   \n[138]\t\t\tWe should be back in an hour.   \n[139]\t\t\tDo you now understand what it \t\t\tmeans when we say, if you're not \t\t\tone of us, you're one of them?  \n[140]\t\t\tAnyone that is still in a power \t\t\tplant.  That is why we try to be \t\t\tinvisible in the Matrix.  \n[141]\t\t\tYou're looking well, Mojo.  \tMojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his \tchin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.  \n[142]\t\t\tThis is the temple.  It is a part \t\t\tof Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden \t\t\tinside the Matrix so that we can \t\t\taccess it.  \tTwo PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.  \n[143]\t\t\tOkay, you're on your own.  Go with \t\t\tthem.  \tThey take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into \tanother room.  \n[144]\t\t\tYou don't have to tell me \t\t\tanything, Neo, because I already \t\t\tknow what she said.  \n[145]\t\t\tI brought you so that you could \t\t\thear it for yourself.  I knew it \t\t\twould help.  \tNeo finishes his cookie.  \n[146]\t\t\tNo one will ever ask you because \t\t\tit is a gift from her.  It is for \t\t\tyou and you alone.   \n[147]\t\t\tCome on!   \n[148]\t\t\tGive me your phone.  \n[149]\t\t\tWe have no choice.   \n[150]\t\t\tTank, find a structural drawing of \t\t\tthis building and find it fast.  \tHis fingers pound the keyboard.   \n[151]\t\t\tI need the main wet-wall.   \n[152]\t\t\tGood.  \tHe cuts off the phone.   \n[153]\t\t\tCome on!  \tCypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.   \n[154]\t\t\tYou have to get Neo out. \t\t\tUnderstand?  That's all that \t\t\tmatters now.  \n[155]\t\t\tHe must get out.  Do you \t\t\tunderstand me?  \tShe nods.  \tA font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole \tladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta \tray.  \n[156]\t\t\tAnd you are?  \n[157]\t\t\tYou all look the same to me.  \n[158]\t\t\tOh, so have I.  \tAgent Smith smiles.   \n[159]\t\t\tI already have.  \tHe stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his \teyes.  \n[160]\t\t\tI knew it!  I goddamn knew it!  \n[161]\t\t\tDo you believe me now?  He's the \t\t\tOne!  Who else could have done \t\t\tthis?  \n[162]\t\t\tIt doesn't matter if I don't \t\t\tbelieve you --  \tHis eyes light up.  \n[163]\t\t\tWhat matters is that you don't \t\t\tbelieve her.   \n[164]\t\t\tI know.  Don't worry, he'll make \t\t\tit.   \n[165]\t\t\tDo it!   \n[166]\t\t\tHe's going to make it.  ", "Tank": "\n[1]\t\t\tMorning.  Did you sleep?  \n[2]\t\t\tYou will tonight.  I guarantee it. \t\t\tI'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.  \tHe offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that \tTank doesn't have any jacks.  \n[3]\t\t\tAny holes?  Nope.  Me and my \t\t\tbrother Dozer, we are 100 percent \t\t\tpure, old fashioned, home-grown \t\t\thuman.  Born free.  Right here in \t\t\tthe real world.  Genuine child of \t\t\tZion.  \n[4]\t\t\tZion is the place, man.  You'll \t\t\tsee it one day.  Last human city. \t\t\tAll we got left.  \tTank smiles.  \n[5]\t\t\tGoddamn, I got to tell you I'm \t\t\tfairly excited to see what you are \t\t\tcapable of.  I mean if Morpheus is \t\t\tright and all.  We're not supposed \t\t\tto talk.about any of that, but if \t\t\tyou are, well then this is an \t\t\texciting time.  We got a lot to do \t\t\tso let's get to it.   \n[6]\t\t\tWe're supposed to load all these \t\t\toperations programs first, but \t\t\tthis is some major boring shit. \t\t\tWhy don't we start something a \t\t\tlittle fun?  \tTank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He \tbegins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro \tdiscs.  \n[7]\t\t\tHow about sore combat training?  \tNeo reads the label on the disk.  \n[8]\t\t\tHey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready \t\t\tfor more?  \n[9]\t\t\tTen hours straight.  He's a \t\t\tmachine.  \tNeo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath \thissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.  \tHe locks at Morpheus.  \n[10]\t\t\tNever.  \n[11]\t\t\tIt's never been done.  \tTrinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she \twhispers.  \n[12]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[13]\n[14]\t\t\tGood.  Now what's this?  \tHe points to one of Neo's monitors.  \n[15]\t\t\tWhat's that?  \n[16]\t\t\tHow about this?  \n[17]\t\t\tElectromagnetic pulse.  Our best \t\t\tweapon against the machines.  The \t\t\tproblem is if someone is still in \t\t\tthe Matrix when that thing goes \t\t\toff, they're not coming back.  \tNeo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.  \n[18]\t\t\tWe just finished the operation \t\t\tprograms and he's showing great \t\t\tretention.  \n[19]\t\t\tHe's taking you into the Matrix to \t\t\tsee her.  \n[20]\t\t\tThe Oracle.  \tNeo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data \tthat seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as \ta METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --   \n[21]\t\t\tWeird.  This area never has this \t\t\tmuch activity.   \n[22]\t\t\tThey're on their way.  \n[23]\t\t\tOh, shit!  Oh, shit!   \n[24]\t\t\tIt's a trap!   \n[25]\t\t\tThey cut the hard-line!  It's a \t\t\ttrap!  Get out!  \tCable yanks open the curtain.  \n[26]\t\t\tNo, no, no.   \n[27]\t\t\tGot it.  \n[28]\t\t\tNow left and that's it in front of \t\t\tyou.  \n[29]\t\t\tNerve gas.   \n[30]\t\t\tNo!   \n[31]\t\t\tWe gotta find the others.  They're \t\t\tstill alive.  \tThe PHONE RINGS.  \n[32]\t\t\tOperator.  \n[33]\t\t\tCypher?  I thought they had you?   \n[34]\t\t\tI got you.  \n[35]\t\t\tNearest exit is Franklin and Erie. \t\t\tAn old appliance store.  \tCypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.  \n[36]\t\t\tOperator.  \n[37]\t\t\tGotcha.  You're not far from \t\t\tCypher.  \n[38]\t\t\tSo did we.  That boy's got nine \t\t\tlives.  I sent him to Franklin and \t\t\tErie.  \n[39]\t\t\tGot him.  \tCypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself \tawake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.  \n[40]\t\t\tHow's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing \t\t\tyou're about to die?  \n[41]\t\t\tI'll be all right.  \n[42]\t\t\tThey're cracking his mind.  \n[43]\t\t\tThey inject virus-like serums to \t\t\tbreak down the system.  It's like \t\t\tcracking a computer.  All it takes \t\t\tis time.  \n[44]\t\t\tDepends on the mind.  But \t\t\teventually, it will crack and his \t\t\talpha pattern will change from \t\t\tthis to this.  \tTank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit. \tThe monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an \torderly symmetrical one.  \n[45]\t\t\tWhen it does, Morpheus will tell \t\t\tthem anything they want to know.  \n[46]\t\t\tIf an agent got inside Zion's \t\t\tmainframe he could do anything. \t\t\tDisable the defense system. It \t\t\twould be the end of us.  \tHe looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.  \n[47]\t\t\tWe can't let that happen.  We have \t\t\tto do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be \t\t\tprotected.  \tTrinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and \tshe starts kicking hin.  \n[48]\t\t\tWe have to pull the plug.  \n[49]\t\t\tWe don't have any other choice.  \tThose words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and \twe watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She \twalks past him and gets into her chair.  \n[50]\t\t\tTrinity, what are you doing?  \n[51]\t\t\tMorpheus could conform at any \t\t\tminute --  \n[52]\t\t\tYou saw that place.  It's suicide.  \tShe glares at him.  \n[53]\t\t\tI know what Morpheus means to \t\t\tyou --  \n[54]\t\t\tOkay.  Store's open.  What do you \t\t\tneed?  \n[55]\t\t\tComing right up.  \tHe loads the weapons disk.   \n[56]\t\t\tHold on, Morpheus.  They're coming \t\t\tfor you.  They're coming.   \n[57]\t\t\tOperator.  \n[58]\t\t\tHe's the One.  He's got to be...   \n[59]\t\t\tGot one ready.  An underground El \t\t\tstation.  State and Balbo.  \n[60]\t\t\tSee ya soon.   \n[61]\t\t\tWhat the hell just happened?  \n[62]\t\t\tI can't!   \n[63]\t\t\tI'm looking, Trinity!  I'm \t\t\tlooking!  \tFrom the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to \tthe front console, typing, bringing up the radar.  \tTrinity follows him.  \n[64]\t\t\tOperator.  \n[65]\t\t\tI got one!  \tNeo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now \tdriving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves, \tslamming into him.  \n[66]\t\t\tWabash and Lake.  A hotel.  \tNeo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the \tcar up over the median.  \n[67]\t\t\tRoom 303.  \tNeo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing \tlane --  \tDirectly into the charging path of an enormous truck \tdriven by Agent Smith.  \tNeo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it, \trending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other \tcars, as it EXPLODES.  \tNeo is up and running even as orange and black clouds \tbillow up behind hin.   \n[68]\t\t\tI'm going to make the call.  \n[69]\t\t\tAlmost there.
