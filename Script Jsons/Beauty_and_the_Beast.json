How can a story never die? It is love we must hold on to Never easy -- but we try \n[2]Sometimes our happiness is captured Somehow a time and place stand still Love lives on inside our hearts And always will Oh, good, Belle, you're back. Can you please hand me the -- \n[3]And the -- \n[4]No no I don't need -- \n[5]Actually yes, that's exactly what I need. \n[6]My daughter? Odd?     Where did you get an idea like that? \n[7]Oh. People. This village may be small, small-minded even, but small also means safe. \n[8]Even back in Paris, I knew a girl who was so different, so daring, so ahead of her time that people mocked her until the day they found themselves imitating her. \n[9]Your mother was... fearless. Fearless. \n[10]What would you like me to bring you from the market? \n[11]You ask for that every year. \n[12]Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. Come on, Philippe! \n[13]Tomorrow!    With the rose! \n[14]The woods are lovely, aren't they Philippe...? I only wish I recognized them. Do you know where we are? Because I don't. \n[15]Whoa! \n[16]Hmm... yes, we can go this way. Walk on! One path closes, another one opens. \n[17]It's all right boy, it's just a bit of snow... in June. \n[18]Go, Philippe! Hurry! \n[19]Philippe! \n[20]Go!   Go! \n[21] \n[22]Water, fresh hay. Looks like you're set, old friend. Rest here... \n[23]While I pay my respects to our unwitting host... whoever that may be... \n[24]Hm. \n[25]Hello?   Anyone home? \n[26]Forgive me, I don't mean to intrude.   I need shelter from the storm. Hello? \n[27]Mm... extraordinary. \n[28]This is beautiful... \n[29]Wherever you are, I'm just going to warm myself by the fire... \n[30]That's better. Oh, much better... \n[31]Oh, thank you! \n[32]It's all right. \n[33]Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality... ... And kindness. \n[34]Roses!   Yes... \n[35]Can't go home empty handed... I promised Belle a rose, didn't I?      I think it's safe... \n[36]Ow! \n[37]Belle?   How did you find me!? \n[38]Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you! \n[39]No, he means forever. Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower. \n[40]Belle, I won't let you do this. I lost your mother. I won't lose you too. Now go! \n[41]Belle, listen to me. It's all right. Live your life. Forget me. \n[42]I love you, Belle.    Don't be afraid. \n[43]What?! \n[44]Belle!   I'll come back!    I promise! \n[45]Help! Somebody help me! We have to go... not a minute to lose... \n[46]He's got Belle... locked in a dungeon! \n[47]A beast... a horrible monstrous beast! \n[48]My daughter's life is in danger, why do you laugh!? His castle is hidden in the woods. It's already winter there! \n[49]The beast is real! Do you understand?! Will no one help me?! \n[50]Thank you, Captain.   Thank you. \n[51]No! I'm sure this is the way! Do you hear those wolves? That means we're getting very close to the castle. \n[52]Stop!   That's it! \n[53]That's the tree. I'm sure of it. Of course, it was downed by lightning at the time, but now it's been restored to an upright position, through some sort of... magic. Or other. \n[54]So that means the castle is definitely that way! \n[55]The beast took her! \n[56]If you think I've made all this up, then why did you offer to help? \n[57]Belle is not at home!   She's with the -- \n[58]Future father-in-law...?   You will never marry my daughter. \n[59]Thank you... Agathe. \n[60]No! You tried to kill me!    You left me for the wolves! \n[61]Ask Agathe! She rescued me! \n[62]Monsieur LeFou! He was there.     He saw it all. \n[63]Never. \n[64]Belle?   I thought I'd lost you! \n[65]Warn him?    How did you get away from him? \n[66]I don't understand. \n[67]Then you know I had to leave her there. I had to protect you. I've always tried to protect you... too much, perhaps... \n[68]It's dangerous. \n[69]Of course I could try to pick the lock. After all, it's only gears and springs. But I would need something long and sharp -- \n[70]Like that.     Perfect. \n[71]Hello.    Oh, I believe this is yours. \n[72]She's very headstrong. Do you have children?

Athletically inclined. \n[2]Exactly, who needs her, when you've got us! \n[3]Je ne sais quoi? \n[4]It's never gonna happen, ladies. \n[5]So.   Moving on? \n[6]Dignity? \n[7]Am I catching you at a bad time? \n[8]A certain damsel is in distress. \n[9]Me neither. \n[10]You know, there are other girls. \n[11]Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why \n[12]No one's slick as Gaston No one's quick as Gaston No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston For there's no man in town half as manly Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on! \n[13]Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston? \n[14]My what a guy, that Gaston! \n[15]Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you! \n[16]Too much? \n[17]In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston! \n[18]Is that fair? \n[19]In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston \n[20]Who has brains like Gaston? Entertains like Gaston? \n[21]And his name's `G-A-S-T... ' Uh, I believe there's another `T' in there, it just occurred to me that I'm illiterate and I've never actually had to spell it out loud before... Gaston! \n[22]I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it... \n[23]You will? \n[24] \n[25] \n[26]Deep breaths, Gaston.   Deep breaths. \n[27]GASTON! STOP! Breathe. Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war. Blood, explosions, countless widows... \n[28]Yes, yes, that's it, that's it... \n[29]I saw that coming... \n[30]For the sake of exhausting all of our options, do we maybe want to consider a less gruesome alternative? \n[31]Wow, this is some storm. At least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere, right? You know it's not too late, we could just go get him... \n[32]It's just, every time I close my eyes, I picture Maurice stranded out there. And then when I open them, he's -- \n[33] \n[34]Me? \n[35]It's a complicated question on a number of accounts, but... no. No, he did not. \n[36]Gaston, with all due respect -- \n[37]There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released \n[38]Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted? \n[39]You must be the talking teacup.       And you must be his grandmother. \n[40]Gaston! \n[41] \n[42]Well I used to be on Gaston's side, but we're in a bad place right now. ", "Lumiere": "", "Wardrobe": "", "Gaston": "\n[1]Look at her, LeFou. My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best. \n[2]I know. Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful. \n[3]Yes, but ever since the war I've been missing something. And she's the only girl I've met who gives me that sense of... \n[4]I don't know what that means. \n[5] \n[6]Bonjour!                           Pardon!   \n[7]...One pound.                      `Scuse me!  \n[8]I'll get the knife.                Please let me through!  \n[9]There must be more than this       Just watch -- I'm going to provincial life!                   make Belle my wife!  The image swells to reveal the whole village, singing.  \n[10]Good morning, Belle!   Wonderful book you have there. \n[11]Well, not that one. But, you know. Books. For your dinner table. Shall I join you this evening? \n[12]Busy? \n[13]No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey. \n[14]That's what makes Belle so appealing. She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor. What would you call that? \n[15]It's outrageously attractive, isn't it? \n[16]You are the wildest, most beautiful thing I've ever seen. No one deserves you, but at least I know our children will be beautiful. \n[17]What is it, LeFou? \n[18]Oh well. It's hero time. I'm not done with you yet. \n[19]Belle! Heard you had a little trouble with the headmaster. He never liked me, either. Can I give you a little advice about the villagers, though? They're never going to trust the kind of change we're trying to bring. \n[20]The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own. \n[21]Maybe you haven't met the right man. \n[22]Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed. \n[23]Belle, do you know what happens to spinsters in our village after their fathers die? \n[24]They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better. \n[25]Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? \"I will never marry you, Gaston.\" \n[26]A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits. \n[27] \n[28]I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou \n[29]Yep. \n[30]When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver And beasts of the field say a prayer First I carefully aim for the liver Then I shoot from behind! \n[31]I don't care \n[32]\n[33]When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Ev'ry morning to help me get large \n[34]And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size of a barge! \n[35]Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston? \n[36]I use antlers in all of my decorating! \n[37]Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet? \n[38] \n[39] \n[40]Don't thank me, Maurice.    Lead us to the beast. \n[41]Look, enough is enough.   We have to turn back. \n[42]I'm done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle? \n[43]There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation. \n[44]So why don't we just turn around go back to Villeneuve? I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner... \n[45]Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let's go home. \n[46]\n[47]Widows... \n[48]Please, forgive me, old bean. That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it? \n[49]If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me. \n[50]Are you coming? \n[51]Oh, Maurice! Thank heavens. I've spent the last five days trying to find you. \n[52]Maurice, it's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder. \n[53]Agathe? You'd hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag? No offense, Agathe. \n[54]You're right. Don't take my word for it. \n[55]LeFou, my dearest companion, did I, your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot, try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved? \n[56]Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind. \n[57]Everything's going to be fine. \n[58]Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free. \n[59]Take him away! \n[60]Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims. \n[61]We all admire your devotion to your father, but you'd say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof. \n[62]This is sorcery! \n[63]Look at this beast. Look at his fangs, his claws. \n[64]The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him. \n[65]I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence! \n[66] \n[67]DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT?    Fetch my horse. \n[68]That creature will curse us all if we don't stop him! Well, I say we KILL \n[69]So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me! \n[70]Through the mist, through the wood Through the darkness and the shadows It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride \n[71]Say a prayer, then we're there At the drawbridge of a castle And there's something truly terrible inside It's a beast, he's got fangs razor sharp ones Massive paws, killer claws for the feast Hear him roar, see him foam But we're not coming home `Til he's dead, good and dead... \n[72]Screw your courage to the sticking place \n[73]Call it war Call it threat You can bet they all will follow For in times like this they'll do just as I say \n[74]Show me the castle! \n[75]Don't lose your nerve, LeFou. \n[76]Sorry, old friend.   It's hero time. \n[77]Hello, beast. I am Gaston.    Belle sent me. \n[78]Were you in love with her? Did you honestly think she'd want you? \n[79]Belle? \n[80]When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall! \n[81]I'm coming for you, beast! \n[82] ", "Bookseller": "", "Stove": "", "Beast": "\n[1]              \n[2] The boy's mother frantically follows him inside --  \n[3]  \n[4]Who are you? \n[5]Your father is a thief. \n[6]\n[7]I received eternal damnation for one. I'm merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father's place? \n[8]\n[9]When this door closes, it will not open again. \n[10]You took his place. \n[11]He's a fool. So are you. \n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! \"Charm the prisoner.\" \n[16]She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? \n[17]You will join me for dinner!     That's not a request. \n[18]Will you join me for dinner? \n[19]I told you to come down to dinner. \n[20]Well be my guest! Go ahead and starve! If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all! \n[21]Idiots! \n[22]  \n[23]Show me the girl. \n[24]  \n[25]\n[26]\n[27] -- and catches it in mid-air! With supernatural force, the beast hurls the wolf across the frozen pond, howling!  All the wolves dive on the beast at once, tearing shreds from his cloak. He strikes at them -- wolves scurry, yelping --  The oversize ALPHA WOLF climbs onto the beast's back, goes for his neck. The beast slams together the wolves on his arms, dropping them -- then reaches back and seizes the Alpha. WOLF and BEAST snarl inches from each other -- the beast squeezes --  Then hurls the Alpha into a stone ledge -- CRACK -- knocking him out. The remaining pack retreats in panic, their yelps echoing through the trees.  TIGHT ON BELLE -- watching as the beast whimpers in pain. His shoulders slump. He collapses in the snow. This is her chance. Belle could run. She looks past Philippe, to the woods -- to freedom. But then turns back, and slowly approaches the wounded beast.  Belle covers the beast with her blanket.   He stirs.   One eye opens.   \n[28]\n[29]  \n[30]ROOOOAARRRR! Ow! That hurts! \n[31]If you hadn't run away, none of this would have happened. \n[32]Well you shouldn't have been in the west wing. \n[33]  \n[34]  \n[35]  \n[36]And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. \n[37]I had an expensive education. \n[38]Why is that not a surprise? \n[39]All that heartache and pining and -- There are so many better things to read. \n[40]Should be something here you can start with... \n[41]Oh. Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours. \n[42]Not all of them. Some are in Greek. \n[43]Maybe. \n[44]I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time. \n[45]Is there more? \n[46]She glanced this way I thought I saw And when we touched She didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked at me that way before \n[47]Nothing. \n[48]Well actually, King Arthur and the Round Table. Knights, and men, and swords and things... \n[49]All right.     I felt like a change. \n[50]Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. \n[51]Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. \n[52]I'm sorry.     Your village sounds terrible. \n[53]What do you say we run away? \n[54]Another little \"gift\" from the Enchantress... \n[55]A book that truly allows you to escape. \n[56]It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you. \n[57]Think of the place you've most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind's eye. Now feel it in your heart. \n[58]Where did you take us? \n[59]Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs- Elys\u00e9es? No? Too touristy? \n[60]What happened to your mother? \n[61]Plague. \n[62]I am sorry I ever called your father a thief. \n[63]  \n[64]I saw her in the ballroom, and I said, well, you're making this so beautiful, we should have a dance tonight. I never thought she'd actually say yes! What was I thinking?! \n[65]I feel like a fool. She will never love me. \n[66]I wish you'd stop saying that! \n[67]There is no one. \n[68]But how will I know? \n[69]I haven't danced in years.   I'd almost forgotten the feeling. \n[70]It's foolish,   I suppose, for a creature like   me to hope that one day he might earn   your affection. \n[71]Really? So you think you could be happy here? \n[72]You must miss him. \n[73] \n[74]  \n[75] \n[76]You must go to him. No time to waste. \n[77]No. Keep it with you. And you'll always have a way to look back on me. \n[78]  \n[79]I let her go. \n[80]I had to. \n[81]No. I've set her free. I'm sorry I couldn't do the same for all of you. \n[82]Now go.

He's never been on his own. \n[86]But he said, \"If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all.\" \n[87]Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape? \n[88]Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing... \n[89]Good night. \n[90]Nothing. \n[91]Getting out of here! \n[92]You have to help me... you have to stand... \n[93]If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much. \n[94]Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. \n[95]Well you should learn to control your temper. \n[96]Try to get some rest. \n[97]Why do you care so much about him? \n[98]But he has cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing. \n[99]  \n[100]How in the midst of all this sorrow Can so much hope and love endure? I was innocent and certain Now I'm wiser but unsure \n[101]I can't go back into my            Days in the past childhood                          Ah those precious days One that my father made            couldn't last secure                             Oh - hold me closer I can feel the change in me I'm stronger now but still not free From the window, we PAN across to the castle, to the horizon - - where the sun is rising. \n[102]What happens when the last petal falls? \n[103]I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse. \n[104]Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore -- \n[105]So you know Shakespeare? \n[106]Actually, \"Romeo and Juliet\" is my favorite play. \n[107]Sorry? \n[108]Like what? \n[109]It's wonderful. \n[110]Have you really read every one of these books? \n[111]Was that a joke?   Are you making jokes now? \n[112]The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled \n[113]Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass \n[114]But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: \"Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be.\" \n[115]There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined \n[116]And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before \n[117]New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be? \n[118]True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see! \n[119]What are you reading? \n[120]Guinevere and Lancelot. \n[121]But still... it's a romance. \n[122]I never thanked you for saving my life. \n[123]They know how to have a good time. \n[124]Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a \"funny girl,\" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment. \n[125]Almost as lonely as your castle. \n[126]How amazing. \n[127]Paris. \n[128]It's so much smaller than I imagined. \n[129]This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived \n[130]Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone \n[131]That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask... \n[132]Quickly... before it takes her too... \n[133]Let's go home. \n[134]  \n[135]I don't know... \n[136]Could anyone be happy if they're not free? \n[137]My father taught me to dance.   I used to step on his toes a lot. \n[138]Very much. \n[139]I'd like to see my father. \n[140]Papa!   What are they doing to him?! \n[141]What did you say? \n[142]Thank you. \n[143]\n[144]   \n[145]Open this door! He's hurt! \n[146]My father's not crazy!   Gaston... Tell him! \n[147]I have just come from the castle and there is a beast! \n[148]You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST! \n[149]There is your proof! \n[150]No, don't be afraid.    He is gentle and kind. \n[151]He's not a monster, Gaston. You are. The beast would never hurt anyone. \n[152]This isn't over Gaston, you'll see! \n[153]I have to warn the beast -- \n[154]He let me go, papa.     He sent me back to you. \n[155]He took me there. I know what happened to maman. \n[156]I understand. \n[157]Will you help me now? \n[158]Yes.   Yes it is. \n[159]Where is he?! \n[160]\n[161]\n[162]I tried to stop them! \n[163]Stop!     Gaston, no! \n[164]No!   It's too far! \n[165]Of course I came back.   I'll never leave you again. \n[166]We're together now.   It's going to be fine. You'll see. \n[167]No... please, no... \n[168] \n[169]I love you. \n[170]How would you feel about growing a beard? "}}
