You're a great guy. \n[134]You think I'm, like, this stripper, but I'm not. I'm a mom, with responsibilities. I don't think you wanna get with that. \n[135]I can't go there. \n[136]That was a mistake. \n[137]The club and the real world, they can't mix. \n[138]We didn't. \n[139]We didn't. \n[140]We didn't. \n[141]You're a customer.

Cheetah's bouncer. \n[149]Look, I'm sorry if I came off like a bitch. I didn't mean that stuff I said. You're not just a customer. \n[150]I'm sure it seems retarded, but I gotta keep that line. It's how I've been able to live with myself the last 12 years. \n[151]There's a place I'm trying to get to in my life. For me and my son. \n[152]I'm leaving that world behind. And I can't bring anybody with me who---- \n[153]Where are you going? \n[154] Cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table.  \n[155]In bed by 11. Don't let him bargain. \n[156]Bye, monkey... \n[157] \n[158] Cassidy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike. She's on her cellphone. On the passenger seat is the Fanfest flyer.  \n[159]There's waffles in the freezer and some burritos if he wants for lunch. He knows where. I'm not sure what time I'll be headed back yet. I'll keep you posted as I go. \n[160]Excuse me. \n[161]Do you know where the Civic Auditorium is? \n[162]Excuse me. \n[163]Randy. \n[164]Don't do this. This is dumb. \n[165]I thought the doctor... \n[166]You could really hurt yourself. \n[167]Out here's what counts. The real world. \n[168]I quit my job, drove 14 hours through the night to get here.

Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up their cheers.  Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN THE HEAD. Randy goes down.  Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest- to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.  Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back, presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams down on his back.  As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE \n[12] Randy's anger builds as he watches.   \n[13] Cassidy BURSTS ONTO THE STAGE. She owns it with rock `n' roll energy.   \n[14] An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.  \n[15] Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly.  \n[16] Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship.  He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same.  Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He obliges as many as he possibly can.  Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in the opening montage.) He \"rams\" each one with his forehead.  \n[17] Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300.  He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.  \n[18]You alright? \n[19]Welcome home. \n[20] He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.  Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory.

He stands over Randy, kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it tauntingly at the crowd.  \n[53]Pathetic. Pitiful godless infidel! \n[54] Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.    \n[55] The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.   \n[56] The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him.
