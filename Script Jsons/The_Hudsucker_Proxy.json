They're all wearin' em upstairs now. \n[12]...It's a fad. \n[13]...Anyway. I hear you've been having, uh... \n[14]...Been having some problems with the board. The more things change, know what Iyayayeeeeee... \n[15]...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman? \n[16]Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective. \n[17]Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal. \n[18]It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile. \n[19]Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal. \n[20]Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying. \n[21]Well, why don't ya read it. \n[22]Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'. \n[23]Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph. \n[24]Skip this part... \n[25]...Last paragraph, last paragraph. \n[26]-- tough titty toenails! \n[27]...That'll show the bastard! \n[28]...Yeah, go ahead. \n[29]...Geez. \n[30]Yup.

Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel! \n[4]You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for? \n[5]You don't accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus aren't interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation. Facts, figures -- those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it's almost as if you're trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull -- like you've gone all soft on him! \n[6]All right, I was out of line. But you're out of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff -- \n[7]Whatever. That's what sells newspapers. \n[8]Watch it, Archer -- \n[9]He grins wolfishly. \n[10]We are printing it! She's hittin' the streets this evening -- \n[11]Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy -- \n[12]Smith has a source on the Hud board -- very senior, very hushhush -- \n[13]Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' -- \n[14] ", "Board": "\n[1]  \n[2]  \n[3]    \n[4]  \n[5]  \n[6]  \n[7]  \n[8]  ", "Member": "\n[1]\n[2]  \n[3]    \n[4]  ", "Aloysius": "", "Moses": "\n[1]Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh. \n[2]Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation -- \n[3]I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way. \n[4]Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart. \n[5]But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know. \n[6]'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does... \n[7]...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a smart one, that Norville, heh-heh, he's a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an' some is hip -- \n[8]...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh? \n[9]An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go? \n[10]Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh? \n[11]I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy. \n[12]  \n[13] \n[14] \n[15]Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed to do this but... have you got a better idea? \n[16]And so began 1959. The new year... \n[17]...And the start of a new business cycle. When he learned that Norville owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was upset at first. \n[18]...It's a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner was there... \n[19]...'cause he was able to keep Sidney from harmin' his ol' self. \n[20]...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled with wisdom and compassion... \n[21]...and started dreamin' up them excitin' new ideas again. You know, for kids! \n[22]...An' that's the story of how Norville Barnes climbed away up to the forty-fourth floor of the Hudsucker Buildin'... \n[23]...an' then fell all the way down, but didn't quite squish hisself. \n[24]...Ya know, they say there was a man who jumped from the fortyfifth floor... but that's another story.

Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs. \n[16] \n[17]So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long. \n[18]How long've you been down here? \n[19] \n[20]\n[21]Well, I -- \n[22]...Mr. Mussburger's office? \n[23]Uhh, no, I -- \n[24]No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in the -- \n[25]No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an -- \n[26]I know but ya see I have this -- here it is, this letter -- \n[27]     \n[28]\n[29]\n[30]You -- \n[31]Well, sir. I've got something for you from the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your very busy time... \n[32]...to show you a, uh... \n[33]...a little something I've been working on for the last two or three years... \n[34]...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby -- \n[35]Well, I'm a college graduate -- \n[36]Well, I made the dean's list. \n[37]At the Muncie College of Business Administration. \n[38]No, sir. \n[39]Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed! \n[40]But, sir! -- \n[41]But -- \n[42]Oh my God, sir! \n[43]Oh my God, sir! \n[44]Oh my God, sir! \n[45]But, sir! \n[46]Sir, my leg is on fire! \n[47]Oh my God, sir! \n[48]Oh my God, sir! \n[49]  \n[50]Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I gotcha by your pants! \n[51]  \n[52]  \n[53]     \n[54]That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that-- \n[55]Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too -- \n[56]Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days? I mean, you're the expert, but at the Muncie College of Business Administration they told us -- \n[57]Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but -- \n[58]...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted? \n[59]Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here -- \n[60]-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class -- \n[61]-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch -- \n[62]But, Sid, I thought you and I were... \n[63]But I'm the president of this -- aww, forget it. \n[64]      \n[65]Not at all. You're light as a feather. \n[66]   \n[67]Just a minute. \n[68]Hungry, anyway. \n[69]Oh, it's nothing really. Just determination and hard work... \n[70]...Of course, when I started in the mailroom last Tuesday I thought it might take more time -- \n[71] \n[72]Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really -- \n[73]I myself -- \n[74]Cigarette? \n[75]   \n[76]Mind if I join you? \n[77]He waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet. \n[78]Excuse me -- I -- executive washroom... \n[79]No, I -- \n[80]...I'm fine, I... You were saying? \n[81]You're from Muncie?! \n[82]'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!' \n[83]...Goooooooo Eagles! \n[84]...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud. \n[85]Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up. \n[86]...Mail room. \n[87]...This'll only take a moment. \n[88]Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes -- \n[89]...Well, I'm not sure where I -- \n[90]But look, I'm president of the company now and I -- \n[91]Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine? \n[92]-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that! \n[93]Please! Norville! \n[94]...It's my pleasure! \n[95]...Gooooooo Eagles! \n[96]Miss Smith, can you come in please to take a letter... \n[97]...of all the cockamamie... \n[98]...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus? \n[99]The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence -- \n[100] \n[101]...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile? \n[102]Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion. \n[103]Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this? \n[104]...I designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top. \n[105]...You know! For kids! \n[106]Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess. \n[107]Well, she probably had a deadline... \n[108]Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam... \n[109]...She's probably just a little confused. \n[110]Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean. \n[111]Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it. \n[112]Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or... \n[113]Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline? \n[114]I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I -- \n[115]...How about Oklahoma? \n[116]Say, what gives? \n[117]  \n[118]That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger. \n[119]I haven't had -- \n[120]You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid. \n[121]  \n[122]No need for concern, sir; it's only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover -- \n[123]  \n[124]I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I showed him the long view we might -- \n[125]Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y -- uh, pleased to make your -- \n[126]Thank you, sir... \n[127]...I understand your concern about the down-ward, you know, but I think you'll find under our strong new leadership... \n[128]We anticipate, in short order, an upward... \n[129]Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover. \n[130]Sid found me the icepack. \n[131]Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story. \n[132]Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this. \n[133]I know that, Amy. \n[134]I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front -- -- not that everyone's buying it. \n[135]Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people -- \n[136]Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town? \n[137]You know, on farm route 17. \n[138]No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17! \n[139]You don't say. \n[140] \n[141]Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea. \n[142]What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy? \n[143]Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched. \n[144]That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways... \n[145]Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth. \n[146]That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve... \n[147]...Tomorrow's my big presentation to the board. I've gotta show Sidney and the guys that I deserve all their confidence! \n[148]Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck! \n[149]  \n[150]  \n[151]-- So we have economy, simplicity, low production cost and the potential for mass appeal, and all that spells out great profitability... \n[152]...I had the boys down at R &amp; D throw together this prototype so that our discussion here could have some focus... \n[153]...and to give you gentlemen of the Board a first-hand look at just how exciting this gizmo is... \n[154]  \n[155]...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good exercise; kids'll just love it, and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant. And the great part is we won't have to charge an arm and a leg! \n[156]You know, for kids! It's... it's ... well, it's... \n[157]Well... I'm for it... \n[158]  \n[159]  \n[160]   \n[161]...Hello? \n[162]Oh my God, sir! \n[163]Oh my God, sir! \n[164]  \n[165]Well, it was no great idea, really. A thing like this, it takes a whole company to put it together, and I'm just grateful for the opportunity -- \n[166]Well, frankly, I don't think anybody expected this much hoopla -- \n[167]Well sure, I guess -- \n[168]Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys... \n[169]   \n[170]Well, I guess so -- I don't think they promoted me because they thought I was a jerk. \n[171]Jeez, I don't know. An idea like this sweet baby doesn't just come overnight... \n[172]-- Although I'll tell you one thing: I certainly didn't expect all this 'hoopla'! \n[173]...And you can quote me on that! \n[174]  \n[175]There's no truth to the rumors; we're just dear friends... \n[176]...Isn't that right, Za-Za? \n[177]Not at all. Why, just this week I came up with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm earning my keep. \n[178]Well, by anyone's account I've saved Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it's ever been. So, yes, I expect to be compensated for that. \n[179]-- ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! \n[180]     \n[181]Hold it!... \n[182]...Nobody move, nobody breathe... \n[183]...An idea... is coming... \n[184]Deflates. He glares at the tailor. \n[185]It's gone now. \n[186]Is she in the book? -- \n[187]Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie -- \n[188]Well, I wouldn't call them nincom -- \n[189]Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if -- \n[190]Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start. \n[191]We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker -- \n[192]Now, Aim -- \n[193]Now, Aim -- \n[194]Now, Aim -- \n[195]Worked in a watch factory? \n[196]Now, Amy -- \n[197]  \n[198]Huh-whuh? \n[199]Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important? \n[200]Wait a minute! \n[201]...Why, this is worthless. \n[202]This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life! \n[203]Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh... \n[204]...say, the hula hoop such a success. \n[205]And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here -- \n[206]-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves! \n[207]An example must be made! \n[208]Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster! \n[209]And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out! \n[210]Get up! \n[211]We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room! \n[212]Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha! \n[213]Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder. \n[214]Ya don't say. \n[215]How's that, Sid? \n[216]Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I -- \n[217]   \n[218]  \n[219] \n[220]Awww, I dunno. \n[221]Nuthin', really. \n[222]I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini! \n[223]I thought you served misfits here! \n[224]What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?! \n[225]I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to -- \n[226]What'd you call me?! \n[227]...You son of a -- \n[228]Huh?! \n[229]...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?! \n[230] \n[231]Hey! Where's that martini?! \n[232]Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella! \n[233]You lied to me! I can't believe you lied to me! a Muncie girl! \n[234]  \n[235]  \n[236]-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I -- \n[237]...You don't? \n[238]...It is? \n[239]Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he -- \n[240]But, Buzz -- \n[241]But, Buzz, you know I never -- \n[242]But Buzz -- \n[243]  \n[244]  \n[245]  \n[246]  \n[247]  \n[248]No -- \n[249]-- No, please! \n[250]  \n[251]    \n[252]  \n[253]  \n[254]  \n[255]Mr... Mr. Hudsucker? \n[256]Norville. \n[257]Yes sir... \n[258]Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid -- \n[259]Oh, geez. \n[260]Geez, I -- \n[261]Yessir. \n[262]Sir? \n[263]Yes sir... \n[264]'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- ' \n[265]'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done? \n[266]'...Looking back now, Sid, I see that I allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself -- but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of I...' \n[267]'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --' \n[268]'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...' ", "Barnes": "", "Amy": "\n[1]I tell ya the guy's a phony. \n[2]As a three-dollar bill. \n[3]Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?... \n[4](as she picks up the morning paper \n[5]...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al. \n[6]I filed it yesterday. \n[7] \n[8]I'll stake my Pulitzer on it! \n[9]I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy... \n[10] \n[11]I don't know what came over me. I suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in after so long, or whatever. But then you couldn't possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry... \n[12]I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story... \n[13]...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless -- though not for want of trying, that I'm friendless, with no one to -- thank you -- take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the moment that you did -- \n[14]Norville, I didn't know you were president here! \n[15] \n[16]At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world -- \n[17]A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future -- \n[18]Only to have that belief, that unsullied optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place -- \n[19]No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years -- \n[20]-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of -- \n[21]Be my guest. A little town you've probably -- \n[22]Are you all right?... \n[23]...Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king? \n[24]Is the a la king repeating on you? \n[25]Values... watchwords... uh, tender years... -- A little town you've probably never heard of... \n[26]...Muncie, Indiana. \n[27]Why yes, do you know it? \n[28]Oh, no, really, I -- \n[29]Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic! \n[30]Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes -- \n[31]  \n[32]Gooooooooo Eagles! \n[33]And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine -- \n[34]Lumbago. \n[35]I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something -- \n[36]-- And it's a cinch -- Goiter -- it's a cinch this guy isn't in on it. How much time to make the Late Final? \n[37]Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted to apologize to... \n[38] \n[39]-- as in a five-letter word for imbecile -- \n[40]-- as pure a specimen as I've ever run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit? Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't make me an expert then my name isn't Amy Archer and I've never won the Pulitzer Prize... \n[41]...In 1957... My series on the reunited triplets -- come on down here, hammerhead, and I'll show it to ya... \n[42]Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's right, I said hammerhead, as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying self-important newspaperman -- \n[43]-- Gnu -- \n[44]-- who couldn't find -- \n[45]-- That's G-N-U -- \n[46]-- couldn't find the Empire State Building with a compass, a road map and a native guide. \n[47]-- or emu. \n[48]...And that's just the potatoes, Smitty, here comes the gravy: The chump really likes me. A Muncie girl! \n[49]I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?! \n[50]A sawbuck! \n[51]On Norville Barnes! \n[52]...Copy! \n[53]Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice. \n[54]-- or lack thereof? \n[55]Is that all, Mr. Barnes? \n[56]I'm sure I -- \n[57]Well, I -- \n[58]...Why don't I just type this up... \n[59]Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man. \n[60]Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record! \n[61]Confused? \n[62](through clenched teeth \n[63]Oh, is that it! \n[64]Smitty. \n[65]Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance. \n[66]Norville Barnes, you don't know a thing about that woman! You don't know who she really is! And only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about! \n[67]  \n[68]Huh?! \n[69]Who are you? How did you know who I am? \n[70]But -- who are you -- what d'you do here? \n[71]Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you? \n[72]So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president. \n[73]That smart?! \n[74]Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president? \n[75]Well, maybe I -- \n[76] \n[77]Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were -- \n[78] \n[79] \n[80]...Hello? \n[81]Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap! \n[82]I know they're gonna buy that stock -- \n[83]I don't know... \n[84]Muncie. \n[85]I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk. \n[86]It's about a dimwitted editor who -- \n[87]Back off -- smoocher! \n[88]...Norville? \n[89]...What happened? \n[90]Let me look. \n[91]Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner. \n[92]...I'm sorry. \n[93]Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary. \n[94]...You do? \n[95]I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions -- \n[96]Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie... \n[97]...Certain people are -- \n[98]...Huh? \n[99]Oh yes! In Muncie! \n[100]Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar. \n[101]Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year. \n[102]Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful -- \n[103]...The people look like ants. \n[104]What a beautiful thought. \n[105]Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys -- \n[106]Norville, there really is something I have to tell you -- \n[107]I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex. \n[108]Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around. \n[109]Oh, Norville -- \n[110]Sure, Norville, sure... \n[111]...Oh, Norville! \n[112]  \n[113]...Norville! \n[114]For Pete's sake, Norville! \n[115]Never mind about that... \n[116]...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing? \n[117]They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families -- \n[118]You mean you know about this? \n[119]Your i -- \n[120]You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?! \n[121]...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me -- \n[122]Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile -- \n[123]Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after -- \n[124]Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you... \n[125]  \n[126]Consider this my resignation -- \n[127]-- Effective immediately!! \n[128]   \n[129]You can't print that! \n[130]But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile! \n[131]Says who?! \n[132]Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger! \n[133]Muncie! \n[134]You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him! \n[135]You want slack, I'll give you slack. You're not putting me out to pasture, Al, I quit! Consider this my resignation -- \n[136]-- effective immediately! \n[137]Norville! \n[138]Oh Norville, I -- \n[139]Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance -- \n[140]Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can -- \n[141]Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it! \n[142]...Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie. \n[143]...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue; You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you! Goooooo Eagles! \n[144]But Norville... I... \n[145]... Oh, Norville!
