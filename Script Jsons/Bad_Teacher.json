Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat. The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large Tupperware tray. \n[3]Incoming! Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder. Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to Tristan and writes him up. Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth. \n[4]  \n[5]Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the \"facts,\" but come on, you know me. I'm Atticus Finch, baby! The class laughs. \n[6]Come on, seriously. You're gonna side with Chase and Shawn over me? \n[7]Atticus Finch is a good lawer because he's a good person whose a layer. Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR -- \n[8]  \n[9]A beat. \n[10]I've been telling him to hit that all year. That's my boy! ", "Ms.": "\n[1]Head Nigger In Charge. The bell RINGS. \n[2]      ", "Pavicic": "", "Lynn": "\n[1]Oh sorry, am I interrupting? \n[2]Do you want to grab some lunch? \n[3]You have that thing going around, huh? \n[4]Are you excited for tomorrow? \n[5]No, it's the first day of school. \n[6]Yeah, that was last week. \n[7]If you hate teaching so much, why don't you just get another job? \n[8]I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm. \n[9]Oh god, I pray for that -- \n[10]You're gonna find someone great. \n[11]You don't want to do that. You're already so pretty. \n[12]We should finish up. Wally's doing that big orientation for teachers in the auditorium. \n[13]But it's mandatory. \n[14]Yeah, I probably won't go either. I don't know I might. I'll probably go, but just sit in the back. Maybe leave early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it by ear. Or just stay till the end. Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them. \n[15]This was fun. \n[16]Sorry. \n[17]I don't know. That's a lot of money. \n[18]Maybe I could sell that jewelry my grandmother gave me? \n[19]Thanks. What about Mark? \n[20]  \n[21]Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too. So what's going on with your boobs? \n[22]I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles. \n[23]I heard he pooped himself in first period. A kid had to walk him to the nurse. \n[24]Scott, do you want anything? \n[25]Sorry, what kind of milk do you want? Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate? \n[26]Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%. Lynn walks off again. \n[27]Here you go. I got you one of each. 42. Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them in the trash and storms off. \n[28]Hey, welcome back. \n[29]Yeah, and a little blood. The kids had too much sugar. 55. \n[30]Anyways, a bunch of us are going out tonight to see Period 5 play. Do you want to come? \n[31]Yes. \n[32]Aren't they terrific? Elizabeth eye-fucks Scott. She catches his eye and he quickly smiles before nervously turning his attention to Amy. Elizabeth watches Amy dance in SLO M0, her BREASTS bouncing up and down. \n[33]You should hear some of their originals. She turns to the bartender. \n[34]No thanks... You know, I was thinking that if you still need that money, you should.try and go for the bonus. Can't hurt. \n[35]For the state test.  57. \n[36]Whichever teacher has the highest scoring class gets a bonus. We talk about it all the time in the faculty meetings. \n[37]$5700. Could be good, right? Let's dance! Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy. \n[38]  \n[39]  \n[40]Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer? \n[41]He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him? The internet? \n[42]Sounds like a fairy tale. \n[43]Sure! My treat. ", "Davies": "", "Garrett": "\n[1]  \n[2]  \n[3]I agree with Chase. Elizabeth pops in the DVD. \"Stand and Deliver,\" starring Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out. \n[4]Hey, Ms. Halsey! \n[5]Quite a film, huh? Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends. Sasha lingers by Elizabeth's desk. 29. \n[6]Oh, I'm gonna get you guys! A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters. Tristan, the bully, cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge at Garrett. \n[7]Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett! \n[8]  \n[9]I thought we could play board games! \n[10] Oh god, no one wants to hear it. Oh god, I'm so embarrassed! \n[11]  \n[12]This is called \"The Chase,\" by Garrett Tiara. XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/ Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it great? / About her smile / That I would walk a mile for / About her personality / That makes me see the best in me / And at night when we sleep / Our souls locked in deep / So that when we sleep / We can stop pretending / And embrace our beautiful ending. Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps, then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off. \n[13]We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in romance perchance / One glance / One dance / Because together we can achieve...  Ba-lance... Thank you. He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks to Elizabeth for a reaction. \n[14]Chase, yeah. You got the subtext. \n[15]Please. \n[16]But I like Chase. \n[17]What do you know? You don't-even know our names. \n[18]       \n[19] Fuck you. Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder. \n[20]Happy New Year. Are you spending that alone, too, or do you want my mom to invite you over? She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves. \n[21]Because she's a cry baby. The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett. \n[22]Ahhh!!! The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS. \n[23]Mr. Delacourte, do you think we could go to the poetry museum? \n[24]Why are you talking like that? \n[25]  \n[26]Hey, you want me to take your picture? \n[27]Alright, well let me know. I've got my camera and my battery's fully charged. She turns away. \n[28]Awesome. \n[29]I love Chase Streeter-Rossi. All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified. \n[30] I love you, Chase. I've always loved you. And even though you pretty much stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I don't care. I remember the Chase that wrote me a card when my dad was overweight and had to go to the hospital because of his heart -- \n[31]Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a different card. And then, a year later, when he left my mom and moved in with his trainer, you wrote me another card. What happened to us? Remember when we had a sleepover in the second grade and you wet your bed and you were so embarrassed and you made me promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I never did and I never will. I know we're really young, but remember Romeo and Juliet were only 13. A lot of people don't know that. So there it is. My heart on a sleeve.  Don't let me leave / Always believe / A beat. Chase stares at Garrett. 93. \n[32]  \n[33]I'm not going back. Leave me alone! \n[34]No! Garrett runs off. \n[35]I'm not leaving without talking to the poet laureate. \n[36]What do you care? \n[37]You have to be here. You're a teacher. \n[38]So. you came looking for me on your own? \n[39]I just want to know what to say to Chase to get her to like me. \n[40]They'll probably reject me, too. \n[41]  \n[42]I can't go back there. All the kids will laugh at me. \n[43]Maybe Chase is wondering where I am. \n[44]Hey, there's a bunch of people outside of my house. Elizabeth wakes up and looks up to see: A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL, including Amy, Scott, Melody, and many. of Garrett's classmates; a SEA OF TV CAMERAS; and \n[45]She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity. But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around here! \n[46]Well, I should get going. See you around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice... He points at her breasts. ", "Tiara": "", "Sasha": "\n[1]Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet you.  My mother baked these for you. \n[2]We're watching a movie on the first day? \n[3]I'm a student leader for the D.C. trip -- \n[4]And we're having our car wash this weekend. If you're around, maybe we could wash your car. \n[5]It's for a good cause. This year, we're trying to get some extra money so that we can go on a Duck Tour! She hands Elizabeth a flyer. Elizabeth glances at it. \n[6]  \n[7]Are you stealing our money? \n[8]I haven't tattled. Yet. \n[9]  \n[10]Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each other at the carwash. I'm a little concerned with the importance you're placing on movies. What about the state test? Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- \"Don't Question My Authority.\" \n[11]Is that marijuana? \n[12]Oh, okay. Feel better. My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here. Sasha pulls out a tupperware container. \n[13]Sugar. Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie. \n[14]I don't want to run for congress. I want to be president. \n[15]If I think about it, will I get extra credit? \n[16] You never assigned it to us. \n[17]You can't do that! I have band and jazz band tonight! \n[18]I don't know. I told you about the car wash money. \n[19]I think I've told you everything. \n[20]No, we're actually learning. Did you know that Animal Farm isn't even really about animals -- \n[21]I want it! Let me think... Oh there was... never mind. \n[22]It was okay. It was medicinal. \n[23]Ms. Halsey was smoking in her car, but she told me her doctor prescribed it. \n[24]But the bell didn't ring. \n[25]I think I hear it again! \n[26]  \n[27]  \n[28]Honest Abe. 92. \n[29]That was from the whole class. \n[30] \n[31]I think it's Garrett Tiara. \n[32]Oh Sasha!  You expect this stuff to happen in Florida, not here. ", "Abernathy": "", "Elizabeth": "\n[1]Almost forty dollars. Thank you! \n[2]Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this type of thing so I'll make it quick. I know I've only been here a year, but there's so much I'm going to miss... \n[3]       \n[4]My students, probably most of all.I'm not saying they were little angels, butthey were all there to learn and that'sthe greatest gift a student can give a teacher. Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last days of seventh grade. A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she signs it. \n[5]And I wish that I had gotten to know all of you better, but between four classes and planning a wedding, I had my hands full. From the little I do know about you, I know that our students are in good hands. Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling them into cardboard tubes. \n[6]And I can't believe it's all over. This year flew by. And even though I'll never teach again professionally, I've realized that I don't need a blackboard and classroom to set an example. Elizabeth comes up behind them. \n[7]Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of the burnouts hands her the joint. \n[8]Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth. \n[9]This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops. \n[10]Woo-hoo! A couple students look at her strangely. \n[11]  \n[12]Yeah. You should have seen it. What a joke. She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his. \n[13]Here's to me never having to work again. And I owe it all to you, Lover. Elizabeth takes a big sip. \n[14]  \n[15]  \n[16]How could you do this to me?! I'm sorry. \n[17]You are buying me the biggest pair of yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm talking serious blood diamonds. Sheila SNEEZES again. Bless you. \n[18]  \n[19]Excuse me? I love her. Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's large breasts. \n[20]You love her? She's a hooker. \n[21]  \n[22]Shut the fuck up.  And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us. \n[23]I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night. \n[24]My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you. \n[25]For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married.  Because I love you. \n[26]You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together! \n[27] I'm not even listening to you anymore. She starts to open the door. He closes it. The ring! \n[28]Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off. \n[29]It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease. Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS behind her. \n[30] You've gotta be shitting me. \n[31]Amy Squirrel. \n[32]Okay. \n[33]My fiance and I broke it off. I found him in bed with someone else. Oh my gosh! \n[34]It was another man. \n[35]Somebody doesn't. \n[36]  \n[37]  \n[38]Stupid. Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash and exits. It hits the rim and lands on the floor. Okey-dokey. \n[39]  \n[40]Um -- kinda. \n[41]I'm in the middle of something, Lynn. My treat. \n[42]Fine. \n[43] \n[44]Is tomorrow Saturday? \n[45]Wait, I thought I had a week to get my class together. \n[46] Fuck my ass. \n[47]And do what? Sell perfume at the mall? Work at a day care center?  You know, when I first got into teaching, I thought I was doing it for all the right reasons: short hours, summers off, no accountability. \n[48]From now on, my full-time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me -- \n[49]And that makes a shit ton of money and doesn't ask too many questions.  I spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the Bulls practice. Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to settle down. And they all wear condoms. And then they take the condoms with them. That's how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant. Like it's so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom. \n[50]I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean, I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I get my new tits, I'll probably be a -- 13. \n[51]I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a chance against all those Barbies dolls out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may she rest in peace. Lynn checks her watch. \n[52]Yeah, I'm not going to that. \n[53] Ooohhh... \n[54]Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay. \n[55]It's okay. You can get me next time. \n[56]      \n[57]Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me with Jessica Simpson's tits? He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it. Go bigger. Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door. \n[58]Cool, yeah. She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM. \n[59] \n[60]  \n[61]       \n[62] Just leave them on the desk. Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there. After a moment, Elizabeth looks up. \n[63]You need something? 16. - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the front of the class. \n[64]Anyone here seen \"Stand and Deliver?\" Show of hands.  No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow. Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two KIDS in the front of the class. \n[65]You and you, go grab the TV and roll it up front.  And you, go shut off the lights. The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha shuts off the LIGHTS. \n[66]Ugh. Oatmeal raisin? She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her desk. Sasha looks on, sadly. \n[67] \n[68]Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with the cole slaw. \n[69]Tell you what. Why don't you send me a memo, and if I have any questions, I'll come to you. \n[70]How do I know what you heard? \n[71]Are we gonna have a problem, me and you? \n[72]I don't know what you've heard, but I don't munch box. \n[73]Like getting manicures and going shopping on Sundays? Shit like that? \n[74]That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm gonna get going. Cover for me? Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off. \n[75]  \n[76]I'll do you one better. I'll take you there. \n[77]Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure. \n[78]Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language Arts. Welcome, welcome. They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices Scott's VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH. \n[79]Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger- LeCoultre? \n[80]Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby. \n[81]Oh? Your grandfather designs watches? \n[82]Shut up! \n[83] \n[84]That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them. \n[85]Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles. 21. \n[86]Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town? \n[87]Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother. \n[88]Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte. Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each other. \n[89]  \n[90] \n[91]Wow. And the nipples are just... I love them. I'll take two. They all laugh. Elizabeth notices Dr. Vogel'.s watch. \n[92]Maurice Lacroix. That's a great watch. \n[93]  \n[94]I was thinking, you know, maybe a D. \n[95]Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's, really turn some heads. 23. \n[96]Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with monster fake tits. So now I need monster fake tits so that I won't lose my next fiance. Those are my expectations. Is that realistic enough for you? \n[97]Let's do December 19th. Start of winter break. \n[98]That's absurd. What if I don't spend the night at your facility? \n[99]No. A MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR walks by. \n[100] Hi...  Listen, I'm a teacher, not a drug dealer. 24. \n[101]My credit situation is complicated. \n[102]I'll be back. Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the bowl and storms out. \n[103]  \n[104]  \n[105]   \n[106] So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy. She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the back tire of a late-model CAMRY. 25. \n[107] I'm dying and I need money for surgery. Really? Nothing? Don't you get social security or something? Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash. \n[108]  \n[109] Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking off the engagement. Do you know how embarrassing that was?! Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just 10000 dollars and it would really mean the world to me. Lover? You there? Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes. \n[110]Fucking Troll! Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom. \n[111]No. I said 'fucking troll.' \n[112]Hey, you got ten grand? \n[113]I know. And I hate asking a friend for money -- especially as good a friend as you. This has its desired effect on Lynn. \n[114]That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that.  But it looks great on you. \n[115]What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick? \n[116]I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over. \n[117]Huh. Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are? Amy stammers. \n[118]Lynn, you teach them. What do you think? \n[119]We don't all have your tits, Squirrel. So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation. \n[120]That's right. Walk away. - There he is! Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up. There he is! \n[121]  \n[122]We'll pick this up again tomorrow. The students shuffle out. Garrett hustles after Chase. \n[123] What. \n[124]Shocker. \n[125]I've got some Mexicans who already do it for nothing. \n[126]   \n[127]Blugh! Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his finger -- \"one minute.\" Elizabeth notices his cheap dolphin watch. \n[128]Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with anyone. \n[129]Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot, of ways, movies are the new books. \n[130]Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans. \n[131]What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from a kindred spirit. \n[132]Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved. \n[133]Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash. \n[134]She just does so much. It might be nice to give her a little rest. Especially that early on a Saturday. \n[135]It just feels so good to help. \n[136]  \n[137] Sorry I'm late. \n[138]Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy. \n[139]How dare you?! I'm here early on a Saturday for you guys. And for the record, nobody likes a tattle tale. \n[140]Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and flunk your ass. How will that look on your resume? \n[141]Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta finish counting this money. Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her. \n[142]See you Monday! Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves back. \n[143]  \n[144] Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's? Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. \"Is she talking to me?\" Guilty. \n[145]How's Period 5? \n[146]Awesome! Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt from the fridge? Sure thing. Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she squirts the entire container into his coffee mug. \n[147]Oh, I can't. Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee. \n[148]  \n[149]Alright, today, we're starting \"School Ties.\" Classic.  You, shut off the lights. Elizabeth goes to the DVD player. There's a knock at the door and the SCHOOL SECRETARY walks in holding a box. She hands it to a confused Elizabeth. \n[150]Here what is? \n[151]Oh, yes. In the memo. The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box. Tristan and.a couple kids start making farting noises with their hands. \n[152]Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit. Alright, look, we all know these tests are gay -- Elizabeth turns to a student who COULD BE GAY. \n[153]Hey. Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where the kids dutifully take Scan-trons and test booklets. \n[154] According to this memo, I'm supposed to give you forty-five minutes per section. Blah blah blah. Clear your desks, pencils out and -- begin! Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison. 39. Elizabeth takes the TV and swivels it to face her desk. She turns on the movie, turns down the volume (just a little bit) and reclines. \n[155]  \n[156]What a phony. \n[157]Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm never gonna get married. I'm gonna die broke. I should just blow my brains out.  There he is! Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids. He gives them a big wave. \n[158]I want to sit on his face. \n[159]You're really making a habit out of this. 40. \n[160]Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk? Elizabeth gives her a \"can you get out of here?\" look. \n[161]So, Scott -- Lynn comes back. \n[162]I don't know. Surprise me. \n[163]She's funny. Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to console the girl. Elizabeth turns back to Scott. \n[164]So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to hear about your experiences in the Peace Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight. \n[165] Yeah, Silly, I meant after. \n[166]Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us. Scott looks around, then lowers his voice. \n[167]Oh? \n[168]Because she's ugly? \n[169]  \n[170]  \n[171]Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points to her. \n[172]That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do.  And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say. Help yourselves to some delicious snacks and drinks in the back. Class dismissed. They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON A \"refreshments\" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER. Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by a sharply dressed PARENT. \n[173]Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. \n[174]If I know Chris, he'll get there. \n[175]  \n[176]You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud. The parents beam. \n[177]A student like that would benefit so much from some extra attention. \n[178]  \n[179]It's just so hard, on my salary, having to pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on me with his twin sister... and, unlike a lot of these other teachers, all I truly care about is helping your child learn. And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a full grade higher -- or your money back. Chase's mom takes out her check book. \n[180]Make it out to \"cash.\" \n[181]  \n[182]       \n[183]You must be so proud. \n[184]A kid like that, if I could just give some more one on one time, he would just blossom. \n[185]Unfortunately, in a class of twenty- five... \n[186]And with the amount they pay teachers... \n[187]I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you could help out by giving me a little -- you know -- somethin somethin. Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back at her blankly. \n[188]It's just, it's really tough to teach the way that I want to teach when there's so little money. I mean, look at this place. \n[189]So long, Crazy. As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear the opening beats of COOLIO'S \"GANGSTER'S PARADISE.\" \n[190]  \n[191]      \n[192]  \n[193]Enough with the commotion! The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES the movie. The SONG comes back on. \n[194] What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth doesn't. \n[195]It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business. 48. \n[196] Are those oatmeal raisin? \n[197]You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head. \n[198]Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress. \n[199]See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs. \n[200]You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it. \n[201] Hopeless. Watch your feet. 49. Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car. Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that reads, \"Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!\" \n[202]  \n[203]  \n[204]Seriously? \n[205]Seriously? She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront. \n[206]Why's the store closed? The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely. \n[207]Seriously? Elizabeth looks around. The streets are empty. Not a person in sight. \n[208]Whatever.  Hey, you got a lighter? \n[209] \n[210] \n[211]  \n[212]I find that hard to believe. Listen, I hate to eat and run, but I've gotta head over to the shelter. \n[213]Yeah, I love helping bums. \n[214]If it's cheesecake, I'll stay. \n[215]If you're not really serving dessert, I'm gonna have to get going. \n[216]She sits back down. \n[217]Junior likes to rhyme. 53. \n[218]So your poem's about that girl? \n[219]Can I give you some advice? \n[220]Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions. \n[221]Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful. \n[222]I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same \"Gymnastics\" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know. \n[223]Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it. \n[224]Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door. \n[225]  \n[226]Shut up. \n[227]What is that, vomit? Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain.. \n[228]Ugh. No. Elizabeth heads out. Lynn, still blotting, follows her. \n[229]Um, yes! That sounds like a party.  Lynn, do you want to come? \n[230]Great. I need to get drunk. I mean, not drunk drunk. But a strong buzz. Still be able to drive home. \n[231] They're perfect. \n[232]Two more.  You want anything? \n[233]What bonus? \n[234]How much? \n[235]  \n[236]  \n[237]  \n[238]  \n[239]Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats. \n[240]Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as they're opened for the first time. \n[241] Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone? \n[242]  \n[243]We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down. \n[244]Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus. \n[245]Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic. \n[246]On the first hundred pages. \n[247]Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator. Things are about to change. Recess is over. \n[248]  \n[249]Did you get my Cool Ranch? He tosses her a bag of chips. \n[250]  \n[251]Okay, now, what is the significance of the Mockingbird in the novel? What was Harper Lee trying to tell us? No one raises their hand. \n[252]  \n[253] Anyone else? Chase raises her hand. \n[254] \n[255]Okay, good. Can anyone add to what that girl said? \n[256]  \n[257]Use examples from the book. \n[258]Good work today. And don't forget to leave your closing statements on my desk. The students all dutifully drop off their papers, placing them in a neat stack next to other ungraded PAPERS. Principal Snur exits, giving Elizabeth a thumbs up. \n[259]  \n[260]  \n[261] I've just been such a mess the last few days. Working myself to the bone. 63. \n[262]Well, I should get going. Nice seeing all of you. Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth squeezes Scott's shoulder as she exits. Amy notices. \n[263]  \n[264]Proofread. \n[265]Wrong!!! \n[266]Is this English? \n[267]Are you fucking kidding me? Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan runs to the door and peeks out. \n[268]Sit down. Elizabeth races to the window. \n[269]The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook. \n[270] \n[271]Keep reading. Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk, obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS. Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her way through the second and then the third, the chewing becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder. Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by Principal Snur and Amy. \n[272]Sorry. I had something caught in my throat. The German Shepherd continues barking. \n[273] Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll excuse me, my class has a state test to prepare for. Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit. Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once, the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER. \n[274]Whoa. \n[275]Class dismissed. \n[276]Get out of my face.  And leave the corn chips. The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out. From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her. \n[277] But first, a nap. \n[278]  \n[279]Balls! She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground. After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the, papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST MANUAL. And in the corner, an address: \n[280]Huh. Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it. \n[281]Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey... \n[282]Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint. \n[283]Unfortunately, I can't make it in today. My grandmother took a turn for the worse and it looks like she's dead. \n[284]  \n[285]Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish me luck. \n[286]Is Tucker here? \n[287]No. He dumped me, remember? \n[288]Like I told \"Frat Guy #1,\" I'm not interested. \n[289]I need some date rape drugs. \n[290]   \n[291]Get your hand off my ass. \n[292]  \n[293]Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman and I'm calling from the Chicago Tribune. Who could I speak to regarding allegations of racial bias on your standardized tests? A beat. \n[294]You must be Carl. His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such an attractive woman. Elizabeth stands and extends her hand. Carl notices Elizabeth's very short skirt. \n[295]Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. Elizabeth motions for him to sit down. \n[296]Great drive. I love downstate Illinois. \n[297]Hmm mmm. \n[298]Wow. I did not know that. \n[299]Hello, Jeopardy! Have you ever auditioned? \n[300]Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat with you all night. \n[301]But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so I'll get right down to it. I've spoken to various, um, black citizens who are alleging that your tests are biased towards white people and Orientals. \n[302]No problem. \n[303]Oh, right. Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting down notes. \n[304]You don't need to convince me. But you know what would help, Carl? For me to see one of this year's tests. \n[305]I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on a bit of a deadline. \n[306]Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I totally get it. Enough business for one night. I'm gonna have another drink before I hit the road. What's your poison? \n[307]Fantastic.  One white wine, one tequila sunrise, and two shots of tequila. 74. \n[308]Well, that makes two of us. Elizabeth gives Carl \"fuck me\" eyes. He nervously sips his drink. \n[309]What turns you on, Carl? \n[310]You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously. \n[311]  \n[312]Even better. \n[313]Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine. 75. \n[314]White wine in the office. You're a bad boy. Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle. \n[315]Do you have any music? \n[316]A toast. To new friends. \n[317]Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room. \n[318]Easy, Cowboy. Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen. \n[319] Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out, STILL STANDING. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She pulls out a folder. \n[320]And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf. She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN: \"You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie.\" \n[321]  \n[322]Okay, go. The students open their test books and start. Twenty- five pencils hit paper in unison. \n[323]      \n[324]Okay, pencils down. A couple of groans. A couple of frantic moves to fill in more scantron bubbles. \n[325]Come on, come on. It doesn't even matter. Bring your tests up. The students dutifully place their tests into a neat stack on the corner of Elizabeth's desk and exit. Elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides all of the exams into the trash. She pulls out a match and lights the exams on fire. She then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack of completed exams. She places the new exams into an official-looking folder and exits. \n[326]This is unexpected. All of the color drains from Amy's face as Elizabeth stands and waves at the crowd. \n[327]       \n[328]Something big. Maybe two big things. Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug. \n[329]I've got my eye on someone, but he's dating a major cunt.  Pardon my French. \n[330]She is. \n[331]  \n[332]And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by. \n[333]  \n[334]Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar. \n[335]Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature. \n[336]I wouldn't miss it for the world. Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks down at her breasts. \n[337]So long, suckers. \n[338]Is Amy going to be okay? \n[339]I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's in my thoughts. \n[340] You guys are amazing. Period 5 is definitely going to make it. Scott smiles wide. Garrett walks up the aisle. He looks at Elizabeth, then turns to Scott. \n[341] Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love to walk around and look at all the poetry on the walls, but unfortunately, the itinerary's really tight. \n[342]Just go sit down, sweetie. Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to his seat. Scott smiles at Elizabeth. \n[343]When you love what you do, it comes easy. \n[344]  \n[345]  \n[346]Yeah, everyone knows that. \n[347]Slavery's the worst. \n[348]You really hate slavery, huh? \n[349] Got it. \n[350]Hey, I want you to know you can talk to me about anything. Slavery, the Holocaust, relationships. Scott smiles. Elizabeth smiles. They lock eyes -- a moment. \n[351]Harder, harder. Elizabeth tries pulling off her shirt. Scott pulls it back down. \n[352]Erg. Dry fuck the fuck out of me. \n[353]That was fast. \n[354]But we're so good together. We both hate slavery, we both love teaching. And call me crazy, but I always imagined us spending summers at your family's compound in Hyannisport. \n[355]It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well, I'm getting new ones in, like, two days. Don't make a decision until you see them. \n[356]What're you -- 13? Elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks. \n[357]  \n[358]  \n[359]Fuck! Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and all of the students look over at Elizabeth. \n[360]What?! The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing. \n[361]Hey, Abe Lincoln, get up. Tour's not over. \n[362]You'll get over it. Get up. \n[363]Now. \n[364]Hey, come back here you little -- Elizabeth starts running after him in heels. She immediately breaks a heel. \n[365] \n[366]Fucker. \n[367]Garrett! Garrett! Her cell phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID: \"HOT SCOTT.\" She puts the phone back in her purse. \n[368]  \n[369]      \n[370]Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of a cry baby. Have you seen him? \n[371]Fantastic. \n[372]Poetry? \n[373]Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend. Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming up by a trash can fire. \n[374]I need a ride. \n[375]No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and me pointing mace at your face. I'll give you ten bucks. \n[376]It's closed. Won't be open till morning. Come on. Let's get back to the hotel. I'm sure everyone's mad at you. Garrett stands his ground. \n[377]Do you think that some Shel Silverstein wannabe is going to tell you the meaning of life? \n[378]I'm here, right? \n[379]Not for long. I'm getting fired for cheating as soon as we get back. Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth. \n[380]Yup.  And you owe me a new pair of Nanette Lepores. \n[381]You know what you should do? What? \n[382]Just go out and sleep with as many girls, as you possibly can. Get her out of your head. \n[383]Yeah, probably. But life's about how you deal with rejection. You can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time. And I figure a kid like you with not much going for him -- if he were to choose the latter -- might end up becoming a pretty strong man. \n[384]Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably shitting a brick. \n[385]You seriously think they haven't been laughing already? \n[386]Hate to break it to you, kid, but I don't think anyone gives two shits where we are. \n[387]  \n[388]What the fuck?  Did you steal something? The taxi pulls up to the curb and Elizabeth and Garrett .exit. CHAOS. They're immediately swarmed by everyone. The Cops struggle to push past. \n[389]Just the once on the train. What?! The Cops get through and smother Garrett in a police blanket. A FEMALE COP roughly leads Elizabeth to one of the squad cars. \n[390]This is crazy! He's a kid. Elizabeth is put into the back of squad car. \n[391]I'm a good person! I don't fuck minors! Elizabeth bangs on the window. Amy smiles and waves. \n[392]You want an autograph? \n[393]  \n[394]Just take me back to my cell. \n[395]Oh, you think? Kirk puts his hand up to Elizabeth, like \"I'll take care of this.\" 106. \n[396]More than once! \n[397]  \n[398]  \n[399]Don't answer right now. Let it marinate. Oh, and I should mention that if this goes to trial, I can cry on cue. Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast. And as quickly she started, she stops. \n[400]Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be heading to fifth period. I hate to be tardy. \n[401]Here, I got you this. Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and unravels the \"Integrity\" poster that Elizabeth stole. \n[402]And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it. Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her. \n[403] \n[404]  \n[405]You and Chase, huh? She likes the poetry? \n[406]Easy. \n[407]  \n[408]It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic surgeon, actually. He's amazing. \n[409]No, in recovery. And I looked like ass, so I know it's real. \n[410]It is. Storybook. Well, not total storybook. It's a little messy because his wife filed for divorce last week, but we're gonna get through that. So you want to grab lunch later? \n[411]No, you got it last time. We'll split it. ", "Halsey": "", "Russell": "", "Gettis": "", "Chase": "\n[1]The photographer was, like, sooo nice. He made me feel sooo comfortable. I might get flown to Kansas City for their fashion week. \n[2]Stalk much? Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK JERSEY, turns to Garrett. \n[3]  \n[4]Are we starting \"School Ties\" today? Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a \n[5]You think we should hire a tutor?  I told you. \n[6]Oh, to be a teacher. \n[7]  \n[8]It's a symbol for, um, equality? Elizabeth puts a sticker on Chase's forehead. \n[9]Are you okay, Ms. Halsey? Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering. \n[10]No. \n[11]Gross. Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the class joins in. Garrett runs down the steps, away from everyone. \n[12] Garrett sat diagonal from me in language arts. He was always so supportive of my modelling career. ", "Scott": "\n[1]Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is? \n[2]Oh, you don't have to do that. \n[3]Thanks! I feel like I've been walking around in circles for the last fifteen minutes. Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub. \n[4]Good eye! \n[5]It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed a village for .a year, but my grandfather designed it, so... \n[6]The family business. My mom's maiden name is Jaeger. \n[7]My parents had a minor meltdown when I decided to join the Peace Corps and become a teacher. But they've been cool about it. Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall. \n[8]Integrity. \n[9].. The poster. \"Integrity.\" What a great message for the kids. \n[10]Man, I can't wait for the day that I have my own classroom. \n[11]I'm not married. \n[12]That's horrible! Ooh, 124! This is me. \n[13]  \n[14]I wish it was under better circumstances. Stu Riley's car was vandalized last night. Right in his driveway. \n[15]  \n[16]Hey, guys. \n[17]Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math department, I guess he got that stomach bug that's been going around and I got the call. \n[18]I'm good, thanks for asking. Lynn walks off. \n[19]Isn't it Back-to-School Night? 41. \n[20]Cool! Let's get a group together. \n[21]Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered. You're one of the nicest people I've met here. But... I'm actually seeing someone. \n[22]Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet. \n[23]No. She's beautiful. She's great. She really cares about the kids. It's just... when you're dating a co-worker... \n[24]Anyways, thanks again for asking me out. I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck on that group date. See ya! Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a four cartons of milk. \n[25]Hey, guys. Are you coming to 'In Cahoots' tonight? My band's doing a few songs. Could be fun. \n[26]We'll all grab a drink! \n[27] Now we're cooking with grease! \n[28]Rockabye, rockabye... \n[29]Bye, bye... Bye, bye... \n[30]Hey, Ms. Halsey. \n[31]Well, I think it's great. Some teachers just sail by, doing the bare minimum. It's good to know there are still some actual educators out there. Elizabeth smiles for Scott, like, \"You get me.\" \n[32]  \n[33]Hey, if it isn't Professor Smartypants. Scott playfully punches her shoulder. Elizabeth playfully punches him back. \n[34]  \n[35]We should go out and celebrate.  Your treat? \n[36]No, she sounds terrible. \n[37]Rain check on those drinks. \n[38]I think we're good. \n[39]Oh, um, I don't know, Champ, um -- Scott looks to Elizabeth, like \"please help.\" \n[40]Wow, you are such a natural. \n[41]Alright, guys, count-off. The students begin their count-off. \n[42]  \n[43]I just hate slavery so, so much. An unquestionable evil. I hate it. Elizabeth continues struggling with the fruit. \n[44]If I could go back in time and undo slavery, I would. Elizabeth gives him a sideways glance, like \"no shit.\" \n[45]I hate it. Elizabeth finally dislodges the chunk of fruit roll-up. \n[46] You get it. Scott squeezes Elizabeth's shoulder. \n[47]Thanks for listening. 89. \n[48]  \n[49]Oh my gosh, your body feels so good. 90. \n[50]Oh my gosh, I'm dry-humping the shit out of you. \n[51]Oh my gosh, I'm so close... I'm... pfft. Ugh. Scott rolls off of Elizabeth and exhales deeply. There's a wet spot on his jeans. \n[52]That was a mistake. \n[53]I know, I'm sorry. But this isn't me. And I. know this isn't you. I'm in love with Amy. \n[54]I know. And you're awesome and you have a huge heart and I love your empathy. It's just, when I was dry-humping you, I couldn't stop thinking about dry-humping Any. \n[55]Elizabeth, I think you're beautiful just the way you are, even with your flat chest. And I think Amy's beautiful. But I just have to do what's right. I made Amy a promise. 91. Scott holds up his hand, showing off a PROMISE RING. \n[56]Wait, Elizabeth. Don't go. Spend the night here with me. You can sleep on the other bed. \n[57]Alright, guys, let's settle down. The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain. \n[58]Who had a good time in D.C.? The students let out a cheer. \n[59]Who ate too many french fries at lunch? The students let out another cheer. \n[60]Alright, let's do our final count-off. \n[61]Wait, wait. Where's 5? Who's 5? Everyone looks around. \n[62]Garrett! Garrett! Nothing. Scott looks around, stricken. \n[63]And where's Ms. Halsey? Nothing. \n[64]Alright, everyone on the bus! \n[65]  \n[66]I don't know. You think? \n[67]This is such a mess. \n[68]Thanks, Amy. You're a lifesaver. \n[69]  \n[70]Hey, Stranger.  Listen, now that Amy's transferring, maybe the two of us could go grab a drink. \n[71]     ", "Delacorte": "", "Amy": "\n[1]Just wanted to remind everyone the school day's not over. So let's keep the drinking under control, hmm? That's it. Back to you, Wally. A bunch of teacher roll their eyes. \n[2]The room has been decorated to within an inch of its life. Every surface is covered with posters like \"Noted African-Americans,\" or \"Hispanic American Hall of Fame,\" or \"Women Who Dared.\" A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been placed on each student's desk. Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying to hang a large \"INTEGRITY\" poster. She looks over, sees Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up. \n[3]Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe! \n[4]I know we barely got a chance to get to know one another last year -- what with you planning the wedding of the century and me juggling all my extra-currics -- but I just want to say that I'm super excited to be across-the-hall-mates. \n[5]And I know you kinda skated by last year, doing the bare minimum thing -- you were kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're back and I just know that you are going to rededicate yourself to the task at -- Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands. \n[6]Where's your beautiful ring? \n[7]  \n[8]Hm. Another time then. Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk. \n[9]Of course. I'd never serve a student unwashed fruit. CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple. \n[10]Well, I think the students teach me at least as'much as I teach them. \n[11]Somebody's got a case of the sleepies. \n[12]Did you see what just happened? \n[13]You weren't at the orientation the other day, but we're doing something new this year. It's very exciting. We're splitting the cafeteria into quadrants. Elizabeth yawns. \n[14]So, anyways, in order for the quadrant system to work, it's vital that each teacher maintain order within their quadrant. Because it's really tough for me as head lunch monitor -- or another teacher -- to leave their quadrant to discipline a kid in another quadrant. I know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy to sit with-you after school and explain all of the new guidelines. \n[15]Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan, Stan. 18. \n[16]  \n[17]Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to tell you how to run your class, but maybe it might be fun to do some ice-breakers. Like \"Telephone Charades\" or \"The String Game.\" Or start doing practice questions for the state test. It's never too soon to start. \n[18]Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I was really hoping that we could be more than across-the-hall-mates. \n[19]No, of course not. I don't even know what that is. I just meant friends. \n[20]Yes! Yes! And helping each other out. Looking out for one another. \n[21]        \n[22]Seven minutes. Who's going to watch your quadrant? \n[23]  \n[24]'Scuse,me. Just gonna scooch in here. She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't bother selecting an item. This was clearly her \"in.\" She turns to Elizabeth and Lynn. \n[25]Sooo... I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and I just want to say, that you shouldn't change a thing. You should be happy with the way you are. That's true. \n[26]I would never -- \n[27]I guess that's what you get for trying to help... Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and takes back her change without getting a drink. Amy heads back to the couch. \n[28]Well, look what the cat dragged in! \n[29]Gang members, probably. \n[30]Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade carwash? That's bonkers! 32. Amy immediately regrets saying \"bonkers.\" \n[31]I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack. \n[32]We raised over $6000 last year. That's a record. Is this really the best time to start experimenting? \n[33]Of course. Well, I should skedaddle. Looks like someone needs to plan a Saturday morning bike ride. She turns on her heels and walks out. \n[34]Shishkebobs. She hesitates a beat and then enters. \n[35]Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy Squirrel. He instinctively covers himself with the brochure. \n[36]This'll just take a sec. I thought you might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff. \n[37] \"Later we'll all die, said the gator to the fly.\" 36. Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall. \n[38]I don't want to speak out of school, but I happened to be pedalling by and saw her get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And remember, we barely know anything about her. She was a real lone wolf last year. \n[39]Something about this doesn't pass the smell test, Wally. \n[40]Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super day, you two. Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION from the other stall, followed by a sigh. \n[41]  \n[42]  \n[43]Cold. \n[44]So, you know how I hate to gossip, but I heard that one of the custodians walked in on Omar -- you know, that Arabic boy -- giving... Oral sex to Matty Feldstein after swim practice in the boy's locker room. \n[45]Your shirt's mis-buttoned. Her shirt's mis-buttoned. \n[46]Yeah, it's been quite a change. \n[47]What else, Sasha? \n[48]I can't prove that. What else? \n[49]And no more movies in class? \n[50]        \n[51] I know you're forgetting something. Do you want extra credit on your diorama or not? \n[52]What? \n[53]Wait. Hold your horses. What was medicinal? \n[54]  \n[55]Trust me, Wally. My kids in D.A.R.E. tell me everything and there are drugs in this school. And not just the students. Some of the female teachers. 65. \n[56] Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food is still contraband. That's detention, Buster. \n[57]If anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts of the missing \"Annie\" wig, please let me know ASAP. Because if that wig isn't found, you can bet your bottom dollar the \"sun will not come out tomorrow.\" Back to you, Wally. Amy sits. Principal Snur addresses the teachers. \n[58] Oh boy, third year in a row. This is starting to get embarrassing. \n[59]Hey! Ism so proud of you. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that you -- you! -- would get the bonus, I would've said to whomever it was, 'you must be joshing me.' And now, here we are. Here we are. \n[60]What a good, fun idea. Unfortunately, Scott and I have to go over the itinerary for the D.C. trip. We're the chaperones. We're going together.  We're dating, so it'll also be romantic. You're not dating anyone now, right? \n[61]Well then. Scott, we should skedaddle. Those itineraries won't schedule themselves. Amy and Scott head off. Scott turns around. \n[62]  \n[63]  \n[64]Who did this? No response from the class. \n[65]Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra sticker on their all-star board? Amy presses the apple to her ear. \n[66] Who brought you to me? Amy places the apple up to her ear. \n[67]  \n[68]Enough horsin' around, let's get started. \n[69] Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge! \n[70]  \n[71] I never lose my keys! \n[72]What's wrong with your face?!?! \n[73] Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos! The Maintenance Man exits. Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it. She pulls out the \"Annie\" wig. \n[74]Busted. She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out from the front page. Amy's eyes narrow. She runs to the floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the two, clocking the I.S.A.T. address. \n[75]Looks like somebody's in big, big trouble. \n[76]I think you're the one that might be in some kind of trouble! Did you or did you not give her a copy of the state test? \n[77]What article? \n[78]  \n[79]And like I said, she stole the wig. I think we're dealing with a criminal master-mind. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, Wally. You know how much we all like her. \n[80]You betcha.  You know what scares me the most? This is just what we know. This could be the tip of the iceberg. Who knows what else she's capable of? \n[81]       \n[82]  \n[83]I know. The woman's a criminal mastermind. \n[84]What I need from you is to focus and get our kids home safe. I'll take care of everything here. \n[85]It's what I do. Love you, Scooter. She hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto the table, accidentally knocking the turtle to the floor. \n[86]Oh boy. \n[87]She used to give all the guys that look. That sex look. You know -- Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective. \n[88]She's a monster. \n[89] \"No child left behind.\" How ironic. That a child was left behind. In Washington, D.C. With a statutory rapist. \n[90]Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave us quite a scare, you did. Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking toward Amy, only feet away now. \n[91] Somebody's being a grumple-- BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood. \n[92]Elizabeth keeps walking and turns a corner. A BELL RINGS and the hallway starts filling with STUDENTS. \n[93]Although leaving was a difficult choice... Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to continue. \n[94]When the superintendent personally asks you to work at one of the worst schools in the state, you say yes. I'm looking forward to bringing my brand of zany energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for learning to the underprivileged students at Malcolm X High. I welcome the challenge. The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic. Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches. ", "Squirrel": "", "Arkady": "\n[1]  "}}
