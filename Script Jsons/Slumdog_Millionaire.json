And what type of call centre would this be? \n[8]Aha! So, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with Special Offers, huh? \n[9]An Assistant Phone-basher? \n[10]And what does an Assistant Phone- basher do, exactly? \n[11]- a chi-wallah! Why didn't you say? \n[12]So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal Malik from Mumbai, let's play Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...! \n[13]Not at all, not at all. I hope you will visit us, Commissioner. \n[14]Bring the family. It's a lot of fun. \n[15]Inspector. How good to meet you. Clearly the kid cheated. \n[16]So, it is just a question of how, no? \n[17]We are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case. This kid might run rings around us filmi types, but he won't make fools out of the Mumbai Police Force, I can see that. \n[18]In front of sixty million people. \n[19]Which is what will happen if we don't get a result, Gentlemen. He goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of India watching. But. I can rely on you. \n[20]Has he- has he made any allegations? \n[21]He's a cunning one. A convincing liar. Don't be taken in, Inspector, don't be taken in. \n[22]So, are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees? \n[23]Not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question.

The most famous phrase in our country's history. Maybe you want to phone a friend? \n[31]Or Ask the Audience? I have a hunch they might just know the answer. What do we think? \n[32] \n[33]Well, you're the contestant, Jamal. \n[34]Put the poor man out of his misery, Ladies and Gentlemen. Press your key-pad now. \n[35]The audience has chosen. And, whaddya know? Ninety-nine percent of them think the answer is A). The truth alone triumphs. What do we think, Jamal? A hundred percent would have made me a little more reassured, maybe.... \n[36]Are you married, Jamal? \n[37]Well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is \"Fashion alone triumphs\". You two could be very well matched. \n[38]...won four thousand rupees! \n[39]One more question before the commercial break. What will our Call Centre Assistant do next? \n[40]Religion! Interesting.

I'll be a good little boy with the next one. Promise. \n[48]Meet me after the show. Please. \n[49]Nita, I can explain. \n[50]Baby, it all happened before I met you. I swear to you. \n[51]You see? Amidst all this misery, only you can make me laugh. \n[52]Her and I- nothing. You have to believe me, baby... \n[53]No. I'm not going on. \n[54]I can't. Without you, it's all pointless. \n[55]You.

We've got a wild one, here. \n[68]For sixty-four thousand rupees, Ladies and Gentlemen, the question once again.... \n[69]Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Sure? \n[70]You think so.

Benjamin for Roosevelt? \n[87]There's a million rupees at stake and he's never heard of Roosevelt Franklin...I can't bear to look. \n[88]No, no. Don't you worry, Jamal. You were asked which statesman is depicted on a hundred dollar bill. You said C. Benjamin Franklin. Ladies and Gentlemen... \n[89]Jamal Malik- you chose to play not pay. I'm afraid you no longer have two hundred and fifty thousand rupees.... \n[90]...you in fact have one million rupees! \n[91]Ready for another question. \n[92]For two and a half million rupees.

Does that mean you did know? Once? \n[100]Based on your extensive travelling, right? \n[101]I thought you hadn't been to UK. \n[102] \n[103]Cambridge Circus is not in Cambridge?

You're the one who's in the hot seat, my friend. \n[116]What sports do you play? \n[117]None. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear. Not to worry, there's only ten million rupees at stake... Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history. Was it A) Sachin Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C) Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs. \n[118]You've got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands. You've still got two life-lines, Phone A Friend and 50/50. For ten million rupees: pay, play, or bail out. It's still an option. Remember, if you get the answer wrong, you will lose everything like that. \n[119]Are you sure you want to do this? \n[120]The dreams of so many. On the floor. \n[121]Time for a commercial break, Ladies and Gentlemen. I know, I know, I can't stand the tension either. Don't even think about leaving your seat. We'll be back. \n[122]You've got the luck of the devil, yaar, I'll give you that. \n[123]Oh, the toilet. Sure. Naveed, Jamal wants the bog. \n[124]A guy from the slums becomes a millionaire overnight. You know the only other person who's done that? Me. I know what it's like.

It's your destiny. \n[132]Welcome back to Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? In the chair tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we don't know! In an amazing run, Jamal has already five million rupees but, not content with that, has chosen to gamble for one Crore- that's ten million million rupees. What a player! The question one more time: Which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history. Was it A) Sachin Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C) Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs. \n[133]That's a start. So, it could be Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or Michael Slater. \n[134]Okay. Computer, take away two wrong answers. \n[135]Well, you were right about Sachin Tendulkar. The computer has taken away A) Sachin Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater. That leaves you a fifty-fifty choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you think? Decision time. For half a million rupees. Your answer: B Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs. \n[136]You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting? The Australian? Great cricketer. \n[137]Do you know? \n[138]So it could be B, Ricky Ponting? \n[139]Final Answer? \n[140]Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye. \n[141]With one hundred and ninety- seven first class centuries, the answer is...D. Jack Hobbs! \n[142]Jamal Malik, Crorepati! \n[143]I cannot believe what I am seeing here, tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen....So, are you ready for the final question for two Crore rupees- twenty million rupees? \n[144]Maybe, indeed. Okay, okay. For twenty million rupees, the final question on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? \n[145]Ohhhhh! Just when I thought I would need a pacemaker fitted, we're out of time! What a show, Ladies and Gentlemen, what a show.

See you tomorrow, huh? \n[148]He's a cheat. \n[149]Oh, come on! Of course he is. He's a bloody village boy. Even when I fed him the wrong answer the little shit got it right. \n[150]Well, I didn't exactly- \n[151]Nita? \n[152]Hey. Sweetheart. What about me? I'm sweating, here. \n[153]So. Tonight.

So, you're going to take the ten million and walk? \n[160]No? \n[161]You just said you don't know the answer. I heard that, right? You do understand that if you get the answer wrong, you lose everything? Ten million rupees. A fortune, Jamal. \n[162]We're going to the wire, Ladies and Gentlemen, we are going to the wire. The final Life-line. Here we go.... \n[163]It's ringing. \n[164]Doesn't look as if your friend is in, Jamal. Who is it? \n[165]- the sort of brother who'd go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question? \n[166]You're on your own, Jamal. \n[167]Wow! That's cutting it fine. I'm guessing this isn't your brother. This is- \n[168]Okay! So, Latika, you want to hear the question one more time? And let's be clear about this. Twenty million rupees ride on your answer.

How much? \n[33]Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who stole Constable Varma's bicycle outside Dadar Station last Thursday? \n[34]Everyone in Juhu knows that. Even five year-olds. \n[35]Wouldn't you? \n[36]No. \n[37]It's going to come. Today.

If Maman says my voice is ready. Big money. \n[84]Easily. Maybe an apartment. \n[85]That's what Arvind said. On Harbour Road. You, me and Salim. The three musketeers. \n[86]Every day if we want. \n[87]It's my turn. \n[88]So, this is it, hey, bhai?

We've got to go back. \n[97]Surdas. \n[98]Yes. \n[99] \n[100] \n[101]Where you going? \n[102]We criss-crossed the country from Rajasthan to Calcutta. Every time we were thrown off we got back on again. This was our home for years. A home with wheels and a whistle. \n[103]Salim? Is this heaven? \n[104]So what's that? \n[105]Some hotel, huh? \n[106]Err- \n[107]No, I- \n[108]But of course, Madam. Please follow me. \n[109]This is....the Taj Mahal. \n[110]The Taj Mahal was built by the Emperor Khurram for his wife Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world. When she died, the Emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb...but he died in- in fifteen eighty-seven, before any of the rooms were built. Or the lifts. The swimming pool, however, as you can see was completed on schedule in top class fashion. \n[111]With respect, Madam, the guide book is written by a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian beggars. \n[112]And this, Lady and Gentleman, is burial place of Mumtaz. \n[113]A road traffic accident. \n[114]Maximum pile-up. \n[115] \n[116]It was the best-paid job I've ever had. \n[117]This is the Princess Diana seat, Madam. Allow me. \n[118]Top-class fashion, bottom-class prices! Shoes for all! Shoes for all! \n[119]And life was good. \n[120]This is the biggest dhobi ghat in the whole of India, Mister David. \n[121]They say that every man in Uttar Pradesh is wearing a kurta that has been washed here at least one time. \n[122]I don't know! I didn't do it, did I...? Nothing to do with me...get off! \n[123]You wanted to see the `real India', Mister David. Here it is. \n[124]You can't do that. Can you? \n[125]Does he find her? \n[126]We have to go, Salim. \n[127]Bombay. \n[128]We should have gone a long time ago. \n[129]Latika was one of us. A musketeer. \n[130]I've got cash. \n[131]Dollars. \n[132]Enough. I'm getting my stuff. \n[133]Yes. \n[134]The minimum tip for my services. \n[135]It's C. Benjamin Franklin. \n[136]I think I just have. Haven't I? \n[137]Right. C. \n[138]I've never heard of Roosevelt Franklin. \n[139]I don't know. \n[140]I've heard of him. \n[141]They didn't ask me that question. I don't know why. Ask them. \n[142]Bombay had turned into Mumbai. \n[143]The orphanage had gone, the slum had gone, the people.... all gone. And everywhere was building, building, building. \n[144]But I knew she was here. Somewhere she was here. \n[145]Evenings, I searched. Days, I worked. \n[146]Room service, good afternoon?... Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers, two fries, one cocoa-cola and one mango lassi and a large bottle of mineral water...Bisleri or Himalayan Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir. That will be with you in fifteen minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a nice day. \n[147]Two chicken burgers, coke, mango lassi and a bottle of Bisleri. \n[148]I'm going to Chowpatti again, okay? Want to come? \n[149]We came back to find her. \n[150]I'm going to Chowpatti. \n[151]But she wasn't. \n[152]How do you know? \n[153]Here. \n[154]One hundred. \n[155]No. I swear. \n[156]A building. With a clock on it. Trees behind it. \n[157]A man- it doesn't say his name. He is sort of bald, but has long hair on the sides. \n[158]I am so sorry, Arvind. \n[159]Arvind, I am looking for- \n[160]I don't know. I haven't sung since- since then. Arvind, I- \n[161] \n[162]I owe Latika. \n[163]Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is she alive? \n[164]Thank you. \n[165]Just two minutes to talk to her. \n[166]Come. Quick. \n[167]Come with us. \n[168]You just killed somebody. \n[169]Where did you get the gun? \n[170]- shut up, can't you? Just shut up. \n[171]Happy? \n[172]Service! \n[173]We want a room, boy. Executive Class with smoking. Third floor with balcony. \n[174]Latika? Salim? \n[175]307 here. I want a bottle of Johnny Walker Red Label, beer, wine- \n[176]Ah! Chicken.... \n[177]What kind of chicken? \n[178]Hold the line, chutiye. Pop Tarts? \n[179]Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts, chutiye. \n[180]Found some lunghi! \n[181]Atcha, atcha. \n[182]I'm not! \n[183]Where's Salim? \n[184]I don't care. \n[185]That dance you were doing. In Pila Street. Show me. \n[186]Of course. \n[187]Salim? \n[188]No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a lot to drink... \n[189]No. \n[190]Salim, no, no....! \n[191]Salim... \n[192]Salim... \n[193]When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer. \n[194]Where are they? \n[195]Where did they go? \n[196]Please, Sir. Which way? \n[197]Yes. I'm ready. \n[198]Oh. Well. She did come back, then she went away when Alfie split up with her and now she's back again. \n[199]But it looks as if Alfie still fancies Mo after all, so- \n[200]Rajneesh... \n[201]- `friends and family'. I know. \n[202]Two minutes. \n[203]You have to dial when Prem says \"if\". \"If you want the chance to be a contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...\" That's when they open the lines. \n[204]That's what Anjum in Technical says. He put the system in. \n[205]Hello, Mrs... \n[206]...Mackintosh from King Gussie. \n[207]Kinoosie? \n[208]- just down the road from your house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to the loch. \n[209]Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to Detective Taggart's flat. \n[210]Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I have to wade through a metre of water every morning. \n[211]Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my kilt. \n[212]It's alright once I've had my porridge, my haggis and a few Scotch whiskies- and the monsoon's nearly over, so- \n[213]I don't think that's a good idea. He is a very important man, Mrs Mackintosh- \n[214]- and he doesn't like bloody time wasters. \n[215]Salim? \n[216]I am calling from XL 5 Communications Sir. As a valued customer, we are offering you a free upgrade with our `friends and- \n[217]Family. \n[218]Hello, Salim. \n[219]No. \n[220]No. And I've never been to UK before. But I'll still have a go. \n[221]Why not? \n[222]I can't remember. \n[223]I don't think it's Oxford. \n[224] \n[225]Oh, I haven't. And it's not Leeds, because that's Elland Road, Kirkgate Market, Commercial Street, St Peter's- \n[226]Well, I don't think it's Cambridge. \n[227]Too obvious. There's definitely an Oxford Circus in London, and there's a rowing race between Oxford and Cambridge so there's probably a Cambridge Circus too. I'll go for D) London. \n[228] \n[229] \n[230]Final answer. \n[231]It was self-defence. \n[232] \n[233]Oh. Yes. Sorry. \n[234]None. \n[235]I'll play. \n[236]Liar. \n[237]There was no message at reception. \n[238]I will never forgive you. \n[239]Javed Mehta? The Gangster from our slum? You work for him? \n[240]What do you do for him? \n[241]What for? \n[242]Salim, where's Latika? \n[243]Slum dogs never sleep, only nap. He would disappear for a couple of days and come back changed. Sometimes elated- \n[244]Sometimes the opposite. \n[245]But younger brothers don't interfere. Mostly. \n[246]Baba, I am the new cook from the agency. A thousand apologies, I am late for the Memsaab. \n[247]Baba, I am your dishwasher! \n[248]You've hurt your eye. \n[249]To see you. \n[250]Why does everyone love this programme? \n[251]You have another life. A rich one. \n[252]Are you happy? \n[253]You don't look so happy with a black eye. \n[254]Javed? You are with him? \n[255]Immediately, Sir. \n[256]Come away with me. \n[257]Love. \n[258]It won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy. \n[259]You and me. That is the real world. Come away with me. \n[260]Salim will help us. \n[261]Where? \n[262]Anything. \n[263]I'll wait at VT station. Five o'clock every day until you come. \n[264]I love you. \n[265]You know what I want. \n[266]She is my destiny, Salim. \n[267]Me, I don't care. Latika? She's already half dead. \n[268]You sold her. \n[269]I- I need to- \n[270]I'm not going to become a milionaire. I don't know the answer. \n[271]No, I really don't. \n[272]I don't see what else I can do. \n[273]Latika! Latika! \n[274]Latika! \n[275]Latika! Latika! \n[276]Latika!

Where is she? \n[289]Salim...! \n[290]Because I am a slum dog, chi- wallah, I am a liar, right? \n[291]Who knows? \n[292]Yes. \n[293]I can read. \n[294]Would you believe it? I don't. \n[295]No. \n[296]I'll play. \n[297]I'd like to phone a friend. \n[298]My brother's number, but- \n[299]It's the only number I know. \n[300]Is that really you? \n[301]In Alexandre Dumas' book, The Three Musketeers, two of the musketeers are called Athos and Porthos.

Aramis. \n[306]Latika? Latika? \n[307]Truth alone triumphs? I should have known better. \n[308]Latika? \n[309]I knew you'd be watching. \n[310]This is our destiny. \n[311]This is our destiny.

You'd just murdered somebody with a Colt 45, after all. \n[50]Let's call it manslaughter, then, shall we? \n[51] \n[52]It is all bizarrely plausible. And yet... \n[53]Most of you are. \n[54]But you: you're not a liar, Mister Malik, that is for sure. You are too truthful. \n[55]Thank you, Constable.

Here. \n[48]-I just thought- \n[49]Chutiy\u00e9. Away where? And live on what? What can you provide? What have you got, Jamal? \n[50]Love. That will feed us, will it? \n[51]Where have you been? Get in the real world, Jamal. \n[52]You're crazy. \n[53]Salim? You still believe in Salim? Jamal...I'll be gone soon, anyway. Bombay's got too dangerous for- \n[54]You think he'd tell me? \n[55]Now go, before he kills us both. \n[56]Coming! \n[57] \n[58]Then forget me. \n[59]So what, Jamal? So what?  Now, get out and tell your no- good agency not to send anybody else until they've learnt to cook. You hear? \n[60]But- \n[61]He'll kill you. \n[62]Salim, I....can't. \n[63]Come on, come on! \n[64]Hello? \n[65]Hello? Jamal? \n[66]My name is Latika. \n[67]Yes. \n[68]I'm- I'm safe. \n[69]I don't know. \n[70]I've never known. \n[71]Jamal? \n[72]I thought we would meet again only in death. "}}
