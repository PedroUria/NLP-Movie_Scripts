I need time.  \n[2] Well you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just have to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay?  Brock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck.  \n[3] Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.  \n[4] Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.  \n[5]  Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.   You see this? Right here?  She looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary shape.  \n[6] That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.  \n[7] So we're up to dusk on the night of the sinking. Six hours to go.  \n[8] 26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he knows is wrong.  ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She is watching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN until the image fills frame.  ", "Lovett": "\n[1] It still gets me every time.  The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns.  \n[2] Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.  Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length.  \n[3] It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above.  Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar.  \n[4] Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.  8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby.  \n[5] Right. Let's go to work.  Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick controls of the ROV.  9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward.  \n[6] Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.  \n[7] Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.  SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in 1912.  \n[8] Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.  Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door...  \n[9] Oh baby baby baby.   It's payday, boys.  ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.  \n[10] You are, Lewis.   You rolling?  \n[11] Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.  Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into the safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all.  \n[12] Shit.  \n[13]  Get that outta my face.  \n[14] You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.  Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett.  \n[15] How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!  Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth.  \n[16] Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck...   Hang on a second.  A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong... revealing a pencil  drawing of a woman.  Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower right corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.  The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center.  Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a period black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly the same piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heart-shaped.  \n[17] I'll be God damned.  \n[18] Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.  \n[19] I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering some amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and educational value.  \n[20] I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing just that.  The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body shapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress.  But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl.  Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her hands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her.  The younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her.  \n[21] Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found today...  The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. The image of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME.  \n[22] ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?  ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement.  \n[23] Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.  \n[24] This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ?  \n[25] ... Mrs. Calvert?  \n[26]  Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?  \n[27] A hundred and one next month.  \n[28] And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it?  \n[29] Is your stateroom alright?  \n[30] Would you like anything?  \n[31] Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.  \n[32] I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost?  \n[33] Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.   See the date?  \n[34] If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.   \n[35]  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.  \n[36] Deal.   Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms.  Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable. Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. With a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl. She caresses it wonderingly.  \n[37] Are you ready to go back to Titanic?  \n[38] Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.  \n[39] Will you share it with us?  Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them.  A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Rose recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostly waltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English accented, calling \"Women and children only\".  30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium and terror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions... flashes in the dark.  31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted, debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding past, like dark mouths.  32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the middle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying.  33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well up and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly.  \n[40] Tell us, Rose.  She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship.  \n[41] Just tell us what you can--  \n[42] Well, that's the general idea, my dear.  \n[43]  Lewis...  But Rose laughs with Bodine.  \n[44] Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?  \n[45] Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?  \n[46] Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.  \n[47] Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.  \n[48] Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.  \n[49] We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.  Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of the ship.  \n[50] Oh shit.  \n[51] You had it the entire time?!  FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. The photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her hands in her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace. She stares at it in amazement.  BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.  \n[52] Don't drop it Rose.  \n[53]  It's hers, you schmuck.   Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.  \n[54] Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.  He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of Titanic.  Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is mesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.  \n[55] My God.  His grip tightens on the diamond.  He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep.  \n[56] Would you like to dance?  Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.  308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over end, into the infinate depths.  ", "Lewis": "", "Bodine": "\n[1] Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it.  \n[2] You are so full of shit, boss.  7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck.  \n[3] Walkin' the dog.  SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand Staircase.  Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room.  SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again.  MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:  10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.  11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as Snoop moves around it.  12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top \"granny shoe\". Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll.  Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past.  13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the sitting room of a \"promenade suite\", one of the most luxurious staterooms on Titanic.  \n[4] I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.  \n[5] I'm tryin' boss.  Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going.  \n[6] I'm crossing the bedroom.  The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark.  \n[7] Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?  CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail.  \n[8] Who's the best? Say it.  \n[9] You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.  \n[10] She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe.  \n[11] She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.  \n[12] Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.  The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the rotors.  \n[13] S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.  \n[14]  You don't want anything?  \n[15] Live from 12,000 feet.  ROSE stares raptly at the screens. She is enthraled by one in particular, an image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock is studying her reactions carefully.  \n[16] The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here.  Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. As he is calling up the file, he keeps talking.  \n[17] We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...  \n[18] She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's flooding in the  \n[19] forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up... slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that weight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't deal... so SKRTTT!!   ... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for the bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20 a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision.  The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion.  \n[20] The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM!  The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows the stern.  \n[21] The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.   Cool huh?  \n[22] So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?   That's great!  \n[23]  All you had to do was wait two days!  Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have passed. This process is taking too long.  \n[24] Don't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand...   ... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed.  \n[25] What, uh... happened next?  \n[26] We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.  \n[27] Holy shit.  \n[28]  Rush her.  \n[29] Aww!! That really sucks, lady!  Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.  ", "Thomas": "", "Andrews": "\n[1]  Well, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is...   ...willed into solid reality.  \n[2] All three million of them.  \n[3] Thankyou, Rose.  We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.  83 TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and lighting.  \n[4] The next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please.  \n[5] About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.   But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.  \n[6] Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need.  As they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns, gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which Jack holds open. They duck into the--  \n[7] Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.  \n[8] Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.  \n[9] The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.  \n[10] She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty.  Smith looks like he has been gutpunched.  \n[11] An hour, two at most.  Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.  \n[12] Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never had a boat drill?  \n[13] Where are all the passengers?  \n[14] The ship will sink.  \n[15] Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.  \n[16] Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?  \n[17] Anyone in here?  Rose runs up to him, breathless.  \n[18] What? You have to get to a boat right away!  \n[19]  Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.  \n[20] Hurry, Rose.  \n[21] Why are the boats being launched half full?!  Lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled fall.  \n[22]  There, look... twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five. And I saw one boat with only twelve. Twelve!  \n[23] Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men. Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!  The shot HANDS OFF to Cal, who sees Lovejoy hurrying toward him through the aisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck.  \n[24]  I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.  \n[25] Good luck to you, Rose.  ", "Bobby": "", "Buell": "\n[1] The partners want to know how it's going?  \n[2] There's a satellite call for you.  \n[3] No, trust me, you want to take this call.  \n[4] Rose Calvert.  \n[5] I told you you wanted to take this call.  \n[6] They're inbound.  Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo.  \n[7] The partners are pissed.  \n[8] We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to pull.  ", "Cal": "\n[1] You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.  Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will.  \n[2] Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.   Mind your step.  \n[3] It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.  Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience.  This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose.  A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading.  \n[4] I put my faith in you, good sir.   \n[5]  See my man.  \n[6] We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.  He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers.  Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers and well-wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above.  They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.  They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph \"cinematograph\" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious.  \n[7] Steady!!  \n[8] Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.  \n[9] All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.  \n[10] I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.  \n[11] Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution.  Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread.  \n[12] Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.  \n[13]  He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.  A porter wheels Cal's private safe  into the room on a handtruck.  \n[14] Put that in the wardrobe.  47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets it on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes.  \n[15]  And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first.  \n[16] The first and only. Forever.  Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now.  \n[17] She knows.  Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.  \n[18]  We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce.   You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?  Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth.  \n[19]  Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on.  \n[20] What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!  \n[21] An accident?!  \n[22] You wanted to see the propellers?  \n[23]  Let's get you in. You're freezing.  Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.  \n[24] Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.  \n[25] Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?  Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerage ruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.  \n[26] I know.   Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?  \n[27] Good. Settled then.  Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close to Gracie as they walk away.  \n[28] This should be amusing.  \n[29]  I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why.  From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. She takes it, numbly.  \n[30] I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...  Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... \"HEART OF THE OCEAN\" in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with an infinity of scalpel-like inner reflections.  \n[31] Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.  He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat. He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her.  \n[32] It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the--  \n[33] It's for royalty. And we are royalty.  His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed by Rose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded.  \n[34] There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you would deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.  CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following:  \n[35]  Dawson! I didn't recognize you.   Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen.  \n[36] Thank you.  \n[37] Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night.   This is foie gras. It's goose liver.  We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.  \n[38]  Just a soupcon of lemon...   ...it improves the flavor with champagne.  \n[39] A real man makes his own luck, Archie.  Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his notebook, completely ignoring the conversation.  \n[40] Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.  Cal and te other gentlemen exit.  \n[41] SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside.  \n[42] I had hoped you would come to me last night.  \n[43] Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.  \n[44] You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?  \n[45] Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?  Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.  \n[46] Reminds me of my Harvard days.  T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-day counterpart on an \"Abflex\" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious.  \n[47]  Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship!  \n[48] BACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again, is leaning on his shoulder, watching.  \n[49]  This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.  \n[50] Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door.  \n[51] Wireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone off his ear as the Titanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for THIRD OFFICER \n[52] Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face clenches with fury. He reads the not again: \"DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US \n[53] I have a better idea.  \n[54] Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now you moron!  \n[55] Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards . Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack.  \n[56] That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...   ... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.   Search him.  The Master at Arms steps up to Jack.  \n[57] That's it.  \n[58] Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe.  FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes as he stands behind her, watching.  \n[59]  Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.  \n[60] From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor.  \n[61] It is a little slut, isn't it?  To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly.  \n[62] Look at me, you little--  There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and their steward puts his head in.  \n[63] Get out. We're busy.  The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser.  \n[64] This is ridiculous.  In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's another story in...  \n[65] It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.  \n[66] My God.  Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking?  \n[67] Stay here, Ruth.  Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.  \n[68] Not the better half.  PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is third class. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathing her face in white light.  \n[69] Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?  \n[70] We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...   ...isn't letting any men in at all.  \n[71] Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.   Come on.  Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The SHOT HANDS OFF to a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and ISADOR STRAUSS.  \n[72] CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls out two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out \"Heart of the Ocean\", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the safe.  \n[73]  I make my own luck.  \n[74] Ben, what's the occasion?  \n[75] That's admirable, Ben.   I'll sure and tell your wife... when I get to New York.  \n[76] We're too late.  \n[77] It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.  Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone has released the pets from the kennels.  Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start walking toward the bow. He catches up and falls in beside him.  \n[78] Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a business proposition for you.  \n[79] So we have an understanding then?  \n[80] God damn it to hell! Come on.  He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the bridge.  Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. He stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes.  \n[81] Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.  She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in 1912.  \n[82] My God, look at you.   Here, put this on.  She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold.  \n[83]  There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.  \n[84] Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.  Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur.  \n[85]  You're a good liar.  \n[86] I always win, Jack. One way or another.   Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.  Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her.  222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling...  Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.  SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches the gunwale, climbing it...  Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is back on Titanic.  \n[87]  Enjoy your time together!!  Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to laugh.  \n[88] I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.  He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering.  \n[89] I give it to you... if you can get it.  He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinks about it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist as he crosses the pool into the dining saloon.  \n[90] We had a deal, damn you.  Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal.  \n[91]  Here's a child! I've got a child!  \n[92]  Please... I'm all she has in the world.  McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women.  \n[93] There, there.  \n[94] Get back! You'll swamp us!  Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is dragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.  247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them. He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his violin.  \n[95]  Row! Row you bastards!!  250 NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT as water pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the ship traps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the ship sinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.  Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnace explodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejecting Fabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.  \n[96] Stay back! Keep off!  Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp.  \n[97]  It's that way!  CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit leave him.  FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black.  \n[98] Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you--  She holds up her hand, stopping him.  \n[99]  What do I tell your mother?  \n[100] You're precious to me, Rose.  ", "Hockley": "", "Molly": "\n[1] Why're ships always bein' called \"she\"? Is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?   Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way.  The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette.  \n[2] So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?   Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce?  \n[3] She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?  \n[4] Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.  \n[5] That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip.  Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table.  \n[6] Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot--  They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind them.  \n[7] Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?  \n[8] Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?  \n[9] Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What are you planning to wear?  Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't thought about that.  \n[10] I figured.  \n[11] Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place. Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and Molly is tying his bow tie.  \n[12] Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damn things after 20 years. There you go.  She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into the bathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed.  \n[13] I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's been eating while I'm away.  She turns and sees him, though we don't.  \n[14] My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny.  \n[15] Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?  \n[16] Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club.  As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out several notables.  \n[17] Well said, Jack.  \n[18] Hey, can I get some ice here, please?  Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see it. It disappears astern.  \n[19] What's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our heels.  The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs.  \n[20] Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat, sister.  \n[21] Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the first class seats right up here. That's it.  Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for some other women who might need a push.  \n[22] Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'.  Rose steps back, shaking her head.  \n[23] Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She'll be along.  The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out.  TRACKING WITH ROSE, as she runs through the clusters of people. She looks back and a furious Cal is coming after her. She runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men.  \n[24] Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.  She climbs over Ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her feet.  Around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in the water, others being lowered.  \n[25] Come on girls, join in, it'll keep ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar!  Ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its rows of lights blazing, slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the Atlanic.  \n[26] Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.  \n[27] We got room for lots more. I say we go back.  \n[28] God Almighty.  The great liner's lights flicker.  \n[29] Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.   Well come on!  The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps.  \n[30] I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.  ", "Brown": "\n[1] Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place. Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and Molly is tying his bow tie.  \n[2] God Almighty.  The great liner's lights flicker.  ", "Lizzy": "\n[1] Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck?  \n[2] You actually believe this is you, grandma?  \n[3] April 14, 1912.  \n[4]  I'm taking her to rest.  \n[5] That's enough.  Lizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail wave goodbye.  \n[6] Don't you mean work me?  \n[7] I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and   \n[8] one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.  \n[9] What?  \n[10] Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.  \n[11] What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.  \n[12]  You think she was really there?  \n[13] I'm sorry.  \n[14] Grandma, wait!! Don't--  ROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard.  It is the \"Heart of the Ocean\".  Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime.  ", "Calvert": "", "Spicer": "", "Lovejoy": "\n[1]  These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms.  The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running.  Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his pocket watch.  \n[2] You'll want to tie those.   Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?  Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to join his group.  \n[3] Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--  He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take.  \n[4] --and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate.  Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him.  \n[5] Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs.   And that he stays there.  \n[6] None of the stewards have seen her.  \n[7] Miss Rose? Hello?  He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers.  \n[8] We've been looking for you miss.  Lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and smoothly slips the diamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat.  \n[9]  It's not even your pocket, son.   \"Property of A. L. Ryerson\".  Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a label inside the collar with the owner's name.  \n[10] Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.  Lovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt .45 automatic from under his coat. The Master at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to Lovejoy, then exits with the crewman. Lovejoy flips the key in the air. Catches it.  \n[11] You know... I believe this ship may sink.   I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation...  He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.  \n[12] Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.  Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe.  \n[13] She's not on the starboard side either.  \n[14] The one on the other side is letting men in.  \n[15]  So do I.  Cal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out.  \n[16] There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.  215 IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat 13, already in the water but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge water being pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat 15, which is coming downt he right on top of it.  The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They are ignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of boat 15 from crushing them.  Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls, climbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewman cuts the forward lines. 13 drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds before it touches the water with a slap.  Cal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS--  \n[17] I've found her. She's just over on the port side. With him.  \n[18] What could possible be funny?  ", "Jack": "\n[1]  Hit me again, Sven.  Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand.  ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing.  CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card.  ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC.  The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning.  \n[2] The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change.  Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close.  \n[3] Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.   Sorry Fabrizio.  \n[4] Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...  He slaps a full house down on the table.  \n[5]  'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!  \n[6]  Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and...   ... we're going to--  \n[7] \n[8] Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!  \n[9] Shit!! Come on, Fabri!   Come on!!   It's been grand.  They run for the door.  \n[10] Wait!! We're passengers!  Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets.  \n[11]  Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans.   Both of us.  \n[12]  Come on, Sven.  Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white-painted corridero... grinning from ear to ear.  \n[13] We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!  \n[14] Of course not. That's not the point.   Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!  Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices, feeling the exhilaration of the moment.  \n[15] That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.  \n[16] Don't do it.  She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for her eyes to focus.  \n[17] Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.  \n[18] No you won't.  \n[19] You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.  Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.  \n[20] I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.  \n[21] I'm a good swimmer.  He starts unlacing his left shoe.  \n[22] It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.  She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.  \n[23]  Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.  He starts unlacing his right shoe.  \n[24] Ever been to Wisconsin?  \n[25] Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the--  \n[26] Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.   Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.  \n[27] That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.  He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.  \n[28] Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.  Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.  \n[29] I'm Jack Dawson.  \n[30] I've got you. I won't let go.  Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS again.  Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her.  Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail.  \n[31] Uh huh. That was pretty much it.  He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together.  \n[32]  Sure. Count me in.  \n[33]  Can I bum a cigarette?  Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it open. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for later. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette.  \n[34] Hello again.  \n[35] Uh, yes. Of course. After you.  He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence.  \n[36] So, you got a name by the way?  \n[37] That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.  There is an awkward pause.  \n[38] Jack.  \n[39] Well, here you are.  \n[40] You're welcome. Rose.  \n[41] That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.  \n[42] Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.  \n[43] That penguin last night, is he one of them?  \n[44] Is he your boyfriend?  \n[45] Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.  They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away.  \n[46] So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.  \n[47] So don't marry him.  \n[48] It is that simple.  \n[49] Well, I guess I will tonight.  Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook.  \n[50] Just some sketches.  \n[51] Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.  Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail.  \n[52] Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.  He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish.  \n[53] I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.  For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.  \n[54] Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.  She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight, half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia O'Keefe.  \n[55] She had beautiful hands.  \n[56]  No, no! Just with her hands.  \n[57] I see you.  There it is. That piercing gaze again.  \n[58] You wouldn'ta jumped.  \n[59]  You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.  \n[60] I'm sorry. Really... I am.  \n[61] Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.  \n[62]  Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.  \n[63] Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.  \n[64] Sure. If you like.  \n[65] They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.  He spits. It arcs out over the water.  \n[66] Your turn.  Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.  \n[67] Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!... then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?  She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Two comets of gob fly out over the water.  \n[68] That was great!  Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees her expression and turns.  RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them hawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.  \n[69] Not really.  \n[70] I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it.  \n[71] Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up.  \n[72] No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.  J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose:  \n[73] The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.  Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate.  \n[74]  No caviar for me, thanks.   Never did like it much.  He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.  \n[75] Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor.  Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks.  \n[76] Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.  Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute.  \n[77] I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.   A very lucky hand.  \n[78] No thanks. I'm heading back.  \n[79] Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.  He leans over to take her hand.  INSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.  Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: \"Make it count. Meet me at the clock\".  \n[80] Want to go to a real party?  \n[81] You're still my best girl, Cora.  Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he takes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her back. It is an electrifying moment.  \n[82] Just move with me. Don't think.  The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the steops.  \n[83] How you two doin'?  \n[84] Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse?  Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder.  \n[85] Come Josephine in my flying machine  And it's up she goes! Up she goes!  In the air she goes. Where? There she goes!  They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos.  \n[86] You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.  \n[87] Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.  \n[88] That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.  \n[89] What would you wish for?  After a beat, Rose pulls back.  \n[90] Rose!!  But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.  \n[91] I was just here last night... don't you remember?   He'll tell you.  \n[92] I don't want money, I--  \n[93] I just need to talk to Rose for a--  \n[94] It was them, not her.   Ready... go.  Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching down. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck, where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck.  \n[95] Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and--  \n[96] No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.  Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not like anyone she has ever known.  \n[97] I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.  \n[98] You're right. Only you can do that.  \n[99] Sssshh. Come here.  He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her.  \n[100] Close your eyes.  She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his hands, her arms stay up... like wings.  \n[101] Okay. Open them.  Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky. There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below.  \n[102]  Come Josephine in my flying machine...  Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.  Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers... fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers.  Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear.  Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.  Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear.  100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow.  \n[103]  Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.   Hey... Monet!  He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.  \n[104] Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny.  She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.  \n[105] Should I be expecting him anytime soon?  \n[106] What is it? A sapphire?  \n[107] Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it.  Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh.  \n[108]  He does landscapes.  TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his sketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is an image she will carry the rest of her life.  Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is the best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her energy.  \n[109] Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.  \n[110] Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!  Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges toward them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open.  115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down. Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder.  \n[111] After you, m'lady.  \n[112]  Carry on! Don't mind us!  They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in the dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of the fires.  \n[113] Where to, Miss?  \n[114] Are you nervous?  \n[115] It's okay. I'm alright.  He lays his cheek against her chest.  \n[116] I can feel your heart beating.  She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life.  \n[117] This is crazy.  \n[118] Looks okay. I don't see anything.  \n[119] It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.  Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck, laughing.  \n[120]  It's bad.  \n[121] Now it's worse.  \n[122] Right.  Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.  \n[123] This is horseshit.  \n[124] Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!  \n[125] They put it in my pocket!  \n[126] I was going to return it! Rose--  Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him. He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out into the hall. She can't look him in the eye.  \n[127] Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it!  She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up.  \n[128] Shit.  He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin is raw... no good.  \n[129] Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?!   This could be bad.  181 THE CORRIDOR outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep. Jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hear it.  \n[130] ROSE!! In here!  187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back, locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave.  She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him.  \n[131] That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.  \n[132] See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.  She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk.  \n[133] So... how did you find out I didn't do it?  \n[134] You have to go for help.  \n[135] I'll wait here.  She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashes away. Jack looks down at the swirling water.  \n[136] We'll find out.  They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions the chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe. The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either side of it.  \n[137] Try a couple practice swings.  Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.  \n[138] Now try to hit the same mark again.  She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.  \n[139] Okay, that's enough practice.  He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a target about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on either side.  \n[140]  You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you.  Jack closes his eyes. So does she.  The axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack is grinning with two separate cuffs.  Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.  \n[141] Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.  He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe for a second.  \n[142] Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go.  They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stiars going up, but Jack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell opening visible.  \n[143] Too deep. We gotta find another way out.  \n[144]  Shutup!  Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the steerage stragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blocked by large families carrying all their luggage.  AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she is blue-lipped and shivering.  \n[145] Fabrizio! Fabri!  Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He and Jack hug like brothers.  \n[146] We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?  Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the stairwell.  Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are squeezing through.  \n[147] Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.  Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood.  \n[148] God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!  He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people.  \n[149] You better check out the other side.  They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse.  \n[150] Get in the boat, Rose.  Cal walks up just then.  \n[151] Go on. I'll get the next one.  \n[152]  I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.  \n[153] Almost as good as you.  \n[154] No Rose! NOOOO!!  Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck.  Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought.  \n[155] Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--  And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.  \n[156] Right.  Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband in one cobra-fast move.  He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES.  The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs.  Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.  \n[157]  Stay here.  He moves off as--  Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.  The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.  ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes. It starts to roll down the aisle between tables.  ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks of dishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her.  She scrambles out of the way and--  Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun aimed--  That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into a table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the water which is flowing rapidly between the tables.  Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down on Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoy scrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solar plexus, doubling him over.  \n[158] Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.  He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to the floor with a splas, stunned.  \n[159] Let's go.  Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them the tables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room is flooded up to the ceiling.  Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of the water and wades after them.  \n[160] Come on.  Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with each footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jack approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors right up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tons of pressure.  \n[161] Back! Go back!!  Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a cross-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack's arms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him in Russian. He runs on with the boy--  \n[162] Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.  The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouring through the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to their waist.  \n[163] Come on! Come on!  Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...  Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by the force of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landing and follow the steward up to the next deck.  \n[164]  It's going fast... we've got to keep moving.  Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.  \n[165] Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible.  They push their way aft through the panicking crowd.  \n[166] You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?  \n[167] Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.  They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses his footing ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.  261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.  262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the flagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spot where Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and a liftime... ago.  Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking with emotion.  \n[168] We have to move!  He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified to move. He grabs her hand.  \n[169] Come on! I've got you!  Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely.  The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable.  Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.  Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.  Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.  \n[170]  Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.  She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder.  \n[171] Swim, Rose! SWIM!  She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.  \n[172] Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.  All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming.  \n[173] Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.  \n[174] I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.  His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS.  A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.  Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water.  \n[175] It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.  \n[176] You'll die quicker if you come any closer.  \n[177] The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.  She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering.  \n[178] Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...  Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won't be any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving. He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of exposure already.  \n[179] I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this.  She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyes in the dim light.  \n[180] No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.  \n[181] You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?  \n[182] Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.  \n[183] It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.  His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart. But his eyes are unwavering.  \n[184] You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.  \n[185] Never let go.

He contentedly watches the white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea.  58 AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down.  In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach, jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut.  FABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles.  \n[3] No, but we're making excellent time.  \n[4] I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.  \n[5] Thankyou, Sparks.  Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. He nods reassuringly to Rose and the group.  \n[6] Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit.  Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. They exit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT LIGHTOLLER comes out of the chartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch.  \n[7] Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.  \n[8] Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.  \n[9] And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.  \n[10] What was that, Mr. Murdoch?  \n[11] Close the emergency doors.  \n[12] Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship.  \n[13] A five degree list in less than ten minutes.

And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines!  \n[6] Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.   Retire with a bang, eh, E.J?  A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy.  \n[7] He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas?  \n[8] His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews.  \n[9] Why have we stopped?  \n[10] Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?  \n[11] When can we get underway, do you think?  Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.  \n[12] But this ship can't sink!  \n[13] There is no time to waste!   Lower away! Lower away! Lower away!  FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up from the tangled falls at the madman.  \n[14] Do you know who I am?  Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay.  \n[15]  Yes, quite right. Sorry.  ", "Old": "\n[1] It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains.  CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them.  \n[2] Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming.  35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning.  \n[3] At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called \"new money\".  At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them.  \n[4] By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean...  \n[5] I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed.  ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab salad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder until it draws blood.  \n[6] Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a heart of ice.  Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the are now... transforming through 84 years of life...  \n[7] After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.  THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face.  \n[8] As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.  IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her.  \n[9] The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.  \n[10] He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon...  \n[11] My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of my life... up till then at least.  CUT TO REVERSE: A semicircle of listeners staring in rapt, frozen silence. The story of Jack and Rose has finally and completely grabbed them.  \n[12]  You mean, did we \"do it\"?  \n[13] Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.  Rose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul.  \n[14] Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.  They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color.  Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal. There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a rose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather and wood.  \n[15] PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely fogged up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making a handprint in the veil of condensation.  INSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs and Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostly clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly. She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real.  \n[16] Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such fine hands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remember their touch even now.  \n[17] The two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play the beams around the hold. They spot the Renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly.  FROM INSIDE we see the torch light up Rose's passionate handprint, still there on the fogged up glass. One steward whips open the door.  \n[18] Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below.  Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full. Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface, casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brass glinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and scrambles back up the stairs.  \n[19] Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred.  As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers.  Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond.  \n[20] Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come.  \n[21] That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read.  301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind.  302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau.  Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press--  Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.  Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway.  \n[22] Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?  TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.  \n[23] No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone.   Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved.   I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.  ", "Rose": "\n[1] Turn that up please, dear.  \n[2] I'll be God damned.  \n[3] I was just wondering if you had found the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.  Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression...  \n[4] Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me.  \n[5] Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway.  \n[6] Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.  \n[7] Oh, yes.  Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.  \n[8] There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.   Isn't that right, sweetie.  \n[9] I should like to see my drawing.  \n[10] It was a dreadful, heavy thing.   I only wore it this once.  \n[11] It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number?  \n[12] Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.  \n[13] I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away.  \n[14]  You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value.  \n[15] This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it.  She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass.  \n[16] The reflection has changed a bit.  She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch.  \n[17] My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss.  Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering. We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.  \n[18] No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.  Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallels his rapid-fire narration.  \n[19] Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical.  \n[20] No!  Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone, replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stay quiet.  \n[21] It's been 84 years...  \n[22]  It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.  He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her.  \n[23] Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was...  As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE / MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912...  \n[24] I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania.  A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. \"Cal\" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning.  \n[25] You told me to change.  \n[26] I felt like black.  Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department.  \n[27] It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains.  CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them.  \n[28] Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming.  35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning.  \n[29]  You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again... ?   Picasso.  \n[30] At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called \"new money\".  At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them.  \n[31] By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean...  \n[32] Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.  Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.  \n[33] Excuse me.  She stalks away.  \n[34] I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed.  ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab salad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder until it draws blood.  \n[35] She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the large vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--  With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl necklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself, her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a handmirror against the vanity, cracking it.  \n[36] Stay back! Don't come any closer!  Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights.  \n[37] No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.  \n[38] What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.  \n[39] You're distracting me. Go away.  \n[40] Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.  He takes off his jacket.  \n[41] The fall alone would kill you.  \n[42] How cold?  \n[43]  No.  \n[44] I know what ice fishing is!  \n[45] You're crazy.  \n[46] Alright.  She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He reaches out to take it, firmly.  \n[47]  Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.  Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge of the deck.  She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.  QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder.  \n[48] \n[49] Cal, stop! It was an accident.  \n[50] It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.  Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.  \n[51] I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.  \n[52] Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?  \n[53] As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected in the cracked mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her.  \n[54] My God... Cal. Is it a--  \n[55] The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.  He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror.  \n[56] Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a heart of ice.  Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the are now... transforming through 84 years of life...  \n[57] After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.  THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face.  \n[58] I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...  \n[59] Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.  Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.  \n[60] The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt.  \n[61] As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.  IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her.  \n[62] Hello Jack.  Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella.  \n[63] Could I speak to you in private?  \n[64] Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.  \n[65] Mr. Dawson, I--  \n[66] Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.  \n[67] Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.  \n[68] Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?  \n[69] I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.   I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!  \n[70]  Oh God, I am such an utter fool.  \n[71] Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.  \n[72] Worse I'm afraid.  She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.  \n[73] Yes, exactly!  \n[74] If only it were that simple.  \n[75] Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.  \n[76] What's this?  \n[77] May I?  The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping man, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive. His book is a celebration of the human condition.  \n[78] Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.  \n[79] Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!  \n[80]  You're deranged!  She goes back to the book, turning a page.  \n[81] Well, well...  She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form... almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some strollers go by.  \n[82]  And these were drawn from life?  \n[83] You liked this woman. You used her several times.  \n[84]  I think you must have had a love affair with her...  \n[85]  You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.  \n[86] And...?  \n[87]  You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!  \n[88]  Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.  \n[89] Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...  She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up.  \n[90] ...or a moving picture actress!  She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--  DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail.  \n[91] So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?  \n[92] A whole ten cents?!  \n[93]  Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.   Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.  \n[94] You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?  \n[95]  I think I would.   And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.  \n[96] Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.  \n[97] The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly.  \n[98] Shall we go dress, mother?   See you at dinner, Jack.  \n[99] Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.  \n[100] There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.   And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals.  Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably.  \n[101] And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.  Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse.  \n[102] J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.  \n[103] He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon...  \n[104] To making it count.  Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further.  \n[105] Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this little book.   Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you?!  Andrews smiles sheepishly.  \n[106] Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.  \n[107]  Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.  \n[108]  Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe.  \n[109] Jack, must you go?  \n[110] May I cut in, miss?  \n[111] I don't know the steps.  \n[112] Wait... stop!  She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to Tommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing faster as the music speeds up.  \n[113] You think a first class girl can't drink?  Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around.  \n[114] So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this.  In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around.  \n[115] Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.  Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up.  THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing.  LOVEJOY closes the door.  \n[116] Come Josephine in my flying machine  And it's up she goes! Up she goes!  In the air she goes. Where? There she goes!  They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos.  \n[117] Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless.  She goes to the rail and leans on it.  \n[118] They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.  He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching.  \n[119] A mistake?  \n[120]  I did, didn't I?   \n[121]  Look! A shooting star.  \n[122] I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?  Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems to be thinking the same thing.  \n[123] Something I can't have.   Goodnight, Jack. And thank you.  She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance.  \n[124] I was tired.  \n[125]  I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.  \n[126] I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee--  Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms.  \n[127] We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy.  \n[128] Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.  Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK!  \n[129] Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!  \n[130]  How can you put this on my shoulders?  Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in her mother's eyes.  \n[131] It's so unfair.  \n[132]  O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.  \n[133] Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.  \n[134] Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.  He takes her by the shoulders.  \n[135] Jack, I--  \n[136] You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.  \n[137] It's not up to you to save me, Jack.  \n[138] I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.  \n[139] Oh, look what I've done.  \n[140] Hello, Jack.  He turns and she is standing there.  \n[141] I changed my mind.  He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face.  \n[142] Fabrizio said you might be up--  \n[143] I'm flying!  She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to steady her.  \n[144] That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.  Brock Lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder.  \n[145] ... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table.  \n[146] Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?  \n[147] Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.  \n[148] Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.  CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror behind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it nervously.  \n[149] A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.  Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.  \n[150] I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this.   Wearing only this.  He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:  104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair. She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.  105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools. His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room, wearing a silk kimono.  \n[151] The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want.  She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stone lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the robe.  Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor .  \n[152] Tell me when it looks right to you.  She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember from the drawing... almost.  \n[153] I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.  \n[154] \n[155] My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of my life... up till then at least.  CUT TO REVERSE: A semicircle of listeners staring in rapt, frozen silence. The story of Jack and Rose has finally and completely grabbed them.  \n[156]  You mean, did we \"do it\"?  \n[157] BACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again, is leaning on his shoulder, watching.  \n[158] Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.  Rose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul.  \n[159] Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night.  He does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanic stationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him, and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe.  She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note on top of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK!  \n[160] Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door.  \n[161] Come on!  She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR.  \n[162] Take us down. Quickly, quickly!  The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate. Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.  \n[163] He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...  \n[164] To the stars.  ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet darkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth.  \n[165] Au contraire, mon cher.  He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers.  \n[166] Put your hands on me Jack.  He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight.  \n[167] You're trembling.  \n[168] Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such fine hands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remember their touch even now.  \n[169] Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face clenches with fury. He reads the not again: \"DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US \n[170] Lovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Cal crumples Rose's not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it in half. He tenses to do it, then stops himself.  \n[171] When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.  \n[172] I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.  Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.  130 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee.  \n[173] Could it have damaged the ship?  \n[174] We have to tell Mother and Cal.  \n[175] Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?  \n[176] Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards . Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack.  \n[177] Something serious has happened.  \n[178] Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you--  Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack's coat.  \n[179]  He couldn't have.  \n[180] But I was with him the whole time.  \n[181] From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor.  \n[182] I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.  \n[183] You're certain?  \n[184] Yes, I understand. Thankyou.  Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put on their lifebelts and get to the boats.  \n[185] Oh, Mother shut up!   Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.  \n[186] You unimaginable bastard.  \n[187] Goodbye, mother.  Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Rose and grabs her again, roughly.  \n[188] I'd rather be his whore than your wife.  He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward the lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd.  \n[189] That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd!  Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the two men grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance.  Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs into a knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them...  \n[190] Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!  \n[191] No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.  \n[192] Bottom, left, right. I have it.  \n[193] I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the rest of my life! Now take me down!!  The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift.  \n[194] Left, crew passage.  She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place is understandably deserted. She is on her own.  \n[195] Right, right... right.  She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors on each side.  \n[196] Jack? Jaaacckk??  \n[197] Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.  They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing.  \n[198] I know, I know.  \n[199] I didn't.   I just realized I already knew.  They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out.  A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below.  \n[200] There's no key in here.  They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench.  \n[201]  I'll be right back.  \n[202] Hello? Somebody?!  She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed...  \n[203] Help me! We need help!  He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with terrifying sounds.  The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they come back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life.  A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is upset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.  \n[204] Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's--  \n[205] No, let me go! You're going the wrong way!  He's not listening. And he won't let her go.  She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.  \n[206] See you there, buster!  The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just the way Jack taugh: her.  She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came.  192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped.  Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powers forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at the pain from the literally freezing water.  \n[207] Will this work?  \n[208]  Shutup!  Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the steerage stragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blocked by large families carrying all their luggage.  AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she is blue-lipped and shivering.  \n[209] CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls out two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out \"Heart of the Ocean\", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the safe.  \n[210] Move aside! Quickly, move aside!  Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE with all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward, narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone:  \n[211] If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job   \n[212] with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck... now.  Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.  \n[213] The boats are gone!  She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting two first class ladies.  \n[214] Colonel! Are there any boats left?  \n[215] I'm not going without you.  \n[216] No. Not without you!  She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her and says...  \n[217] You jump, I jump, right?  \n[218] We can't leave him.  Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to the child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--  A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds it is too powerful for them to go against.  \n[219] No! Not that way! Come back!  228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor. The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.  Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to ceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairway going up.  \n[220] Help us! Please!  The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, their arms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto the landing.  \n[221] Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?  \n[222]  And to you, Mr. Andrews.  Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.  \n[223] I trust you.  Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet.  278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water.  Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean.  \n[224] It's so cold.  \n[225] What's that?  Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down.  But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can.  Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him back.  \n[226] Thank God for you Jack.  People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats.  \n[227] It's getting quiet.  \n[228] I love you Jack.  He takes her hand.  \n[229] I'm so cold.  \n[230] I can't feel my body.  \n[231] I promise.  \n[232] I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.  She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now, except for the lapping of the water.  \n[233] \"Come Josephine in my flying machine...\"  ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a glorious band from horizon to horizon.  A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.  TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals. Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down from the stars to the water.  ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars. She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound slow and DISTORTED.  Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her motionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her. The men look away.  Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her.  \n[234]  Jack.  She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.  He seems to be sleeping peacefully.  But he is not asleep.  Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.  \n[235] Oh, Jack.  All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.  She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try.  And then... her eyes snap open.  She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to draw breath, calling again.  292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, turning the tiller.  293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.  \n[236] I won't let go. I promise.  She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.  Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water.  294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.  \n[237] Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred.  As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers.  Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond.  \n[238] Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come.  \n[239] Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.  \n[240] Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased.  She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives.  \n[241] Is this in any way unclear?  \n[242] Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.  She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with emotion.  \n[243] Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.  We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her.  After a moment, he turns and walks away.  \n[244] That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read.  301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind.  302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau.  Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press--  Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.  Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway.  \n[245] Dawson. Rose Dawson.  The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.  Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion.  \n[246] Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?  TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.  \n[247] No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone.   Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved.   I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.  \n[248] Don't come any closer.  \n[249] The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help.  She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand.  \n[250] I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.  The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...  \n[251] You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count.  His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out of his hand. He feels it sliding away.  Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail. Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever.  \n[252] A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:  Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio publicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose with her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and grandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived well.  THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life.  We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile shot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else.  "}}
