ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom. A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun barrel.    GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.  THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a \n[2]\t\tPatience, Marvin.  It has its moments.    A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.  \n[3]\t\tHalf a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians \t\tdon't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out \t\tyour hand.    Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.  \n[4]\t\tCoal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.    \n[5]\t\t\t\t\t \t\tJuly 1, 0.900 hours, agent william \t\tGoodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a \t\twooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.    Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they gingerly lift the lid.  INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with \"UNICEF\" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each.    \n[6]\t\tAppears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts \t\tout a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.   \n[7]\t\tCareful, goddamn it Marvin!    The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.    OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked \"exhaust\" and another marked \"emergency.\"    A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.   IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up.    IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.    \n[8]\t\tI've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news \t\tis the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.    ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode.    \n[9]\t\tEnough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas \t\tto kill everybody in the building.    Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.  \n[10]\t\tChill, Marvin. \t\t\t\t\t \n[11]\t\tGet that away from me. \t\t\t\t \t\tI hate needles.    \n[12]\n[13]\t\tI don't like needles.   \n[14] A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box.   \n[15]\t\tHey honey.   \n[16]\t\tNot now.  \n[17]\t\tYeah, somebody's in a bad mood.    Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.  \n[18]\t\tMuch better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.  \n[19]\t\tHad a close one.  \n[20]\t\tNot really.  \n[21]\t\tCould we change the subject?  \n[22]\t\tHey!  Now there's some good news.  \n[23]\t\tCarla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed \t\tfor the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tI hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout \t\tBobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?    \n[24]\t\tStick with Carla.  \n[25]\t\tWe've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, \t\tinside and out ...    \n[26] \t\tYou're what ... ?  She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:  \n[27]\t\tShit, shit, shit what time is it. \t\t\t\t\t \t\tHello. \t\t\t\t\t \t\tI'll be downstairs in ten minutes.    GOODSPEED hangs up.  The couple stares at each other. Carla's seen this look before ...   \n[28]\t\tI've got to go to San Francisco.   \n[29]\t\tI've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I \t\tcannot deal with this right now ...  Bill, I am very Catholic. \t\tAnd very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.   She turns away from him.  He pulls her back...   \n[30]\t\tI love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this, \t\tthat's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.   \n[31]\t\tIt's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, \t\torder up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...   \n[32]\t\tB.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry \t\tand toxicology.   \n[33]\t\tThis isn't a training exercise, is it sir.   \n[34]\t\tWhy's he going to help us now?   \n[35]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tJesus look at this guy.    INT.  F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping coffee.  Mason sits there, eyes forward.   \n[36]\t\t\"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts.\"    \n[37]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tAncient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his \t\tking.  \n[38]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tArchbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and \t\texecuted by Henry the Second ...    \n[39]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.    \n[40]\t\tYou mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?    \n[41]\t\tTake his cuffs off.  The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed.   \n[42]\t\tNo actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tMr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release \t\tcontract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man, \t\tprovided you cooperate.   He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then Goodspeed.    \n[43]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tI'm a field agent.  \n[44]\t\tI'm a chemical biological weapons expert.    MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ....    \n[45]\t\tUhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.   \n[46]\t\tI don't understand....  \n[47]\t\tWell yes I suppose ...  \n[48]\t\tYes.  You'll be outside.  \n[49]\t\tA hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.   MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen.   \n[50]\t\tI think we can arrange that.   With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract.  He hands it to Goodspeed, who exits.   MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.  \n[51]\t\tSir, that's a legal document.  \t\t\t\t\t\t \n[52]Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: all had something in common.  \n[53]\t\tThey were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going \t\ton, sir?   GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.   \n[54]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tListen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come \t\tto San Francisco.   CLOSE ON MASON, watching Goodspeed, picking up anything he can from the conversation.   \n[55] CARLA stands in the threshold of the apartment, watching the answering machine --  \n[56]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tI repeat, don't come to San Francisco.    \n[57]clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED notices that MASON is staring at him.   \n[58]\t\tYou're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.  \t\t\t\t\t\t \n[59]\t\tJesus...  JESUS CHRIST....   GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun.  Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK, hanging below, is SCREAMING.    \n[60]\t\tAll units, this is Caretaker.  WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX. \t\tMason's in the elevator!  Let me know where he stops!    \n[61]exits, looking at MASON getting into the HUMVEE. The Humvee explodes out of the hotel driveway.    GOODSPEED shouts to the F.B.I. AGENTS across the street:  \n[62]\t\tThat's him!  The F.B.I. SEDANS ROAR off after Mason.  GOODSPEED looks around.  A Ferrari sitting there. GOODSPEED gets behind the wheel.    THE FERRARI blasts out of the driveway after the Humvee.  EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - STREETS - DAY The HUMVEE lumbers up to a traffic light.  Stops behind several vehicles ahead.  \n[63] \n[64]\t\tWhere is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing? \t\tHE'S ON THE PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. \t\tGotta go.    GOODSPEED looks at SPARKLETTS BOTTLES bearing down on him  INT.  S.F. POLICE CRUISER - DAY Two S.F. PATROLMEN.  Their eyes widen too as -- THE SPARKLETTS BOTTLES are bouncing now, roll down on them at 45 m.p.h. A BOTTLE SMASHES through the windshield, showering the Patrolmen with glass.    EXT.  SAN FPANCISCO STPEETS -  - DAY Chaos.  Bottle after bottle smashes down on the -   front-running vehicles.  DENTING HOODS.  SMASHING WINDSHIELDS.  THREE F.B.I. SEDANS and GOODSPEED'S FERRARI negotiate the crashing cars.  They race through the carnage after Mason.  \n[65]\t\tShit shit SHIT SHIT ...    \n[66] GOODSPEED grabs the Ferrarils CELLULAR PHONE and tries the door latch. The goddamn airbac is all over him.... So GOODSPEED shoots the fucking air bag.   \n[67]\t\tIt's not mine.  \n[68]\t\tNeither is this.   GOODSPEED shoves the kid off the Motorcycle.  Speeds off into traffic. The kid stands there dumbstruck.   \n[69]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tMarvin, ring up Wolfburg Federal Pen.  The inmate is \t\tMason, John.   Isherwood gets on the computer.  Starts tapping....  \n[70] \n[71]\t\tNOT NOW Isherwood.  Go to February 1976.  Who was \t\ttransferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin that year?   \n[72]\t\tHit nine nine nine nine.   \n[73]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tF.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a.... \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t.... dangerous situation.   \n[74]\t\tYes madam.  We've got to go, John.  MASON  extends his hand to Jade.  She takes it.  \n[75]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tNo cuffs until we get to the cars,   They continue toward the waiting cars.  \n[76]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tYou almost got me killed.  Twice.    \n[77]\t\tIt hurts.   SANCHEZ, DIRECTOR WOMACK and the F.B.I. AGENTS approach. Womack's arm is in a sling; he's in a volcanic rage.   \n[78]looks up from a computer screen generating 3-D images of different angles of a V.X. ROCKET.  He walks over to the table.  Anderson and the other S.E.A.L.s stare at him.   \n[79]\t\tWell, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. \t\tHere.  The prison morgue. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tIt's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas \t\tbegins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.   \n[80]\t\tNo sir, but I've studied them ....    \n[81]\t\tA little, sir.   \n[82]\t\tNo sir. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tShould I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?    \n[83]\t\tSir, these are very complicated devices...   \n[84]\t\tSir?   \n[85]\t\tThank you.  \n[86]\t\tI join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, \"Bill, \t\tyou're too fucking smart for field work.\" Every year I put in for a \t\ttransfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking \t\tMaytag repairman in the commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and \t\tit's a whole fuckin, city at stake?  Oh Jesus...    \n[87]\t\tI've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe \t\tthe bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....    \n[88]\t\tMy girlfriend's pregnant.    \n[89]and MASON, in black dry suits, join COMMANDER ANDERSON and nine other S.E.A.L.s.  Four S.E.A.L.s will be identified: BOYER, REIGERT, DANDO, and SHEPHERD.   \n[90]\t\tMotor oil?  \n[91]\t\tUhn uhn.  I hate needles.    \n[92]\t\tWait a minute. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tWhat if this thing crashes ...   Dando looks at Reigert.  They laugh.  This remark they obviously find very funny.  Dando continues buckling GOODSPEED in.   \n[93]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's going on?  \n[94]\t\tDon' t do it.   \n[95]\t\tWe're never gettin off this island.  \n[96]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t.... god Jesus we're gonna die   Sanchez, agitated, exits the Command Trailer with Director Womack.  They huddle, speaking in hushed voices.    \n[97]\t\tDon't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...  \n[98]\t\tWait.  Where're you going?   \n[99]\t\tYes I mind.  I mind very much. \t   From the tac radio in Mason's hand:  \n[100]\t\tIt's me sir.  \n[101]\t\tHe says he's leaving the island sir.  \n[102]\t\tHe's got a gun, sir.  \n[103]\t\twould you stop.  Just stop. \t\t\t \t\tI don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million \t\tpeople across that bay who might die... \t\t\t \t\tFuck this. Stop.  Freeze.    MASON turns. GOODSPEED has his g gun trained on him.  He's not the most convincing gun handler.  \n[104]\t\tF.B.I. \tStop right there.  I really mean it.    \n[105]\t\tNow he has all the guns, sir. . \t\t\t \t\tYou've got to help me.  What do you want me to do, beg?   \n[106]see the wall of flame ROARING toward them.  MASON grabs Goodspeed.    \n[107]\t\tNow what?  MASON moves to the bricked-up wall.  Feels around the mortar.  Smiles. Removes a brick. another.  Another.  A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls, revealing A HOLE.    \n[108]\t\tI don't get it.  You're going to help me?  \n[109]\t\tYou don't have to get all bent out of shape.   \n[110]\t\tAll right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?    MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend .....    GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.  \n[111]\t\tSomething's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're \t\tthe convict, and you have all the guns.    MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off. GOODSPEED follows.    \n[112]\t\tThe morgue?    MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE against the wall.  \t\t\tGOODSPEED follows.   \n[113]\t\tYou didn't learn that in prison.    \n[114]\t\tI've got some questions for you but they can wait.    GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS .    GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.   \n[115]\t\tCareful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.  GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the chem rounds.    GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled with poison.    \n[116]\t\tI need a hand here. \t\t\t    \n[117]hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string of wind chimes.    \n[118]\t\tAny epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge \t\tat the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system. \t\t\t \t\tThen loss of muscular function. \t\tThen you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled \t\ton the floor, then your skin turns black...    MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.  \n[119]\t\t\t \t\tPier 39 come in.    \n[120]\t\tWe're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance \t\tsystem chips. \t\t\t \t\tWithout em the rocketslll fly about 500 \t\tfeet and splash down like a wounded duck.  \n[121]moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them:   \n[122]\t\tShut up; you're making me nervous.   \n[123]\t\tWait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. \t\tThere's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.   MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance systems.  \n[124]sprinting across floor, BULLETS chewing the floor.  They dive into the MORGUE INCINERATOR CHUTE, GOODSPEED leaving the tac radio behind ....    \n[125]duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings over their heads, continues down the tunnel and DETONATES against the tunnel wall.    CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it rounds a corner, MASON grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED alone continues down the mono-rail.    MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses himself against the tunnel wall.    AS CART 2 rounds the corner...  WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues down the mono-rail.    MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner  MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the swinging pipe and pulls MASON into Cart 3!    \n[126]looks over his shoulder at MASON and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins slowing down.  CART 2  rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are together.  And on comes --  CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...  \n[127]realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ...  IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down, missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed.  \n[128]pulls the cart brake and --  -- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head and torso between Carts 2 and 3.   The collision knocks MASON off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while --   -- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the tunnel floor. GOODSPEED groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.   \n[129]\t\tMason!  In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE runs up.  Sees MASON concussed, helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's going to cut his throat.   \n[130]\t\tWait.  Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank, stagnant water before.    \n[131]\t\tPretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? \t\tPunk. \t\t\t \t\tWhat're you waiting for?  Limp dick.  \n[132]\t\tI rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.    Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look.    \n[133]It's all I could think of.    They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.  \n[134]\t\tHe thinks we're Seals.   \n[135]\t\tI'll go.  \n[136]\t\tWhat, vou?  \n[137]\t\tGood point.  Okay here, take 'em.   GOODSPEED unpockets the V.X. ROCKET'S GUIDANCE CHIPS.  Hands them to Mason.  MASON heaves them into the bushes.    \n[138]\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[139]\t\tWhat about Mr. Henderson?    \n[140]\t\tWait.  \n[141]\t\tI... I don't know if I can do this.    \n[142]\t\tWell thank-you, thank-you very much.    GOODSPEED creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher.  \n[143]\t\t\t \t\tFreeze. \t\t\t \t\tDrop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.    Pvt.  Cox drops his weapon.  Slowly turns.  Goodspeed, one hand on his gun, the other on HIS TOOLS, begins to unscrew the V.X. CHEM ROUND \n[144]- PVT.  MCCOY appears. Looking down, he sees GOODSPEED and Cox.  He cinches his REPELLING CLIP to the steel railing.    \n[145]\t\tMason. \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tMason?  \n[146]\t\tWhere are you?  \n[147] MASON  sits on a bed.  \n[148]\t\tThis is tiny.   \n[149]\t\tThe cell, Mason.   \n[150]\t\tI only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.   \n[151]\t\tI'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.  \n[152]\t\tWhat is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.   \n[153]\t\tHow?   \n[154] GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells again.    \n[155]\t\tJesus. \t\t\t \t\tWhy didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau \t\twhere the microfilm was?  Make a trade?    \n[156]\t\tI see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your \t\tescape.    \n[157]\t\tYou went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the \t\tpower plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe - \t\tthat much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?   MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.    \n[158]\t\t\t \t\tI only ask because, in our current situation, it \t\tmight be useful information ...    The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell.  \n[159]GOODSPEED hears the doors opening above him.  \n[160]\t\tHey!  Hey what's happening? \t\t\t \t\tMason.  Mason?   Suddenly Goodspeed's cell door opens. GOODSPEED exits the cell.  MASON stands there.    \n[161]\t\tShit....  \n[162]grabs his guns and gear and follows after Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk.  Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence.  Hummel stares at his phone.  The tension is palpable.   \n[163]\t\tMason.  John. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tWhat happened - the injustice done \t\tto you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this.  A million people \t\tacross that Bay will die.    \n[164]\t\tYou were once a different man.    \n[165]\t\tYou were a civil servant.  Sworn to do your duty.  Just like \t\tme.    MASON  begins climbing down to the waterline.  \n[166]\t\tYou'll never make it.   \n[167]\t\tFine.  I'll fuckin, do it myself.    \n[168]\t\tThat change things?  \n[169]\t\tPartners?  \n[170]and MASON  exchange a tense look. mason aims his gun through the slit ...  HUMMEL draws his .45 but Baxter fires first, hitting Hummel squarely in the chest.   \n[171]grabs the semi-consious Hummel and drags him down the corridor-.   \n[172]drags Hummel inside. Hummel collapses against the wall.  His blood runs across the tiled floor.  MASON takes a defensive position in the washrooms doorway.   DARROW AND FRYE attack through the infirmary's maze of rooms, taking cover where they can, squeezing off rounds.  MASON fires at Darrow and Frye from the doorway while GOODSPEED kneels over Hummel.

A strand BREAKS. Four PEARLS fall. GOODSPEED catches three.  The FOURTH drops, hitting his SHOE.  It rolls along the rooftop. GOODSPEED sets aside the other pearls and dives, grabbing the stray pearl an inch from the roof,s edge.    Suddenly THE HUGE LIGHTHOUSE WINDOW behind GOODSPEED EXPLODES, showering GOODSPEED with glass.    ON THE ADJACENT ROOFTOP ~ PVT.  MCCOY, wielding a smoking .60 Cal MACHINE GUN.  McCoy fires a wicked, long, sustained burst, emptyinc his entire ammunition belt.   THE LIGHTHOUSE SEARCHLIGHT FRESNEL blows to shreds. GOODSPEED rolls away, GLASS SHARDS raining down on him, cutting him-. He's a sitting duck.    MCCOY casts aside the .60 Cal and unshoulders a SNIPER RIFLE.  Draws a bead on GOODSPEED again.  GOODSPEED, bleeding, terrified, cowers, awaiting death.   A SILHOUETTE APPEARES behind McCoy.  It's MASON, dirty and bloodied. McCoy spins.  MASON bats the rifle aside, KNEES McCoy in the solar plexus, grips McCoyls NECK -- SNAP! -and HURLS him off the roof.  McCoy falls 5 floors.    GOODSPEED gives MASON a thankful glance.  And hears THE DOOR BURST OPEN \n[180]exits and kneels, reaching for HIS OTHER PANTLEG.  PUllS out his GREEN FLARES.

Darrow pulls his sidearm and levels it.   \n[7]We have two operational rockets left, General.  One on the lower lighthouse, one on the rooftop, ready for fire. General.    \n[8]\t\tGeneral Hummel, noon is approaching.    \n[9]\t\tThey are not going to call General.    \n[10]\t\tYou didn't ever what? \t\t\t \t\tYou didn't ever what, General? \t\t\t \t\tGeneral, forty-eight hours ago I was in \t\ta cushy job at Pendleton.  As of this moment I am subject to prosecution \t\tfor treason and murder.  Do you know what that means.  It means the \t\telectric chair.  For all of us.    \n[11]\t\tAye aye General: coordinates 675 dash Awaiting launch \t\tcommand.  \n[12]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\tGeneral, your command.  \n[13]\t\tI don't believe it.  He pulled the plug.   Frye, disgusted, races down the STAIRS.  \n[14]\t\tYou're gutless.  I knew it.   \n[15]\t\tI'm in.    \n[16]Crisp, Darrow, come in... (thinks; clicks walkie talkie to new channel) Cox, McCoy, get your asses up here!    \n[17]\t\tGive me the guidance chip.   Frye raises his M-16 as GOODSPEED jumps.  Lands hard on the ground below and sprints off.    \n[18]\t\tYou're comin, with me.   GOODSPEED shoves Frye away.  Frye drops, his body quivering.  Blood pours form his ears and nose.  Frye spasms in a sickening dance of death.   GOODSPEED reels away,.  COUGHING.  Dizzy, he falls to his knees.  He's gassed and knows it.  Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG.  A SYRINGE taped to his calf.  ATROPINE.   He pulls it free and hesitates.  A beat, then -- He PLUNGES the long needle into his chest.  Into his heart.  Depresses the plunger.    ", "Darrow": "\n[1] They hand signal to the Huey pilots.  The Hueys take off around the back of the island. \n[2]\t\tYes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.   \n[3]\t\tWell, sir, frankly ... \t\tEL I see that I am ' \t\t\t\t\t\t  \n[4]\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tSeventeen hours left.  What the fuck is he \t\tdoing?  How much time does it take to transfer money from one account \t\t...    \n[5]\t\tMaybe now they'll pay up.    \n[6]\t\tThen maybe we'll execute a few hostages.   One S.E.A.L. DANDO, is still alive.  He's gurgling blood. Staring up at Hummel.   \n[7]\t\t\t \t\tPut a bullet in him.   Pvt.  Royce, appalled, can't bring himself to do it.  \n[8]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\tYes sir.   Royce kneels.  Feels Dandols carotid artery.  \n[9]\t\tGotta be kidding me.  They send an old man.   MASON gives Darrow a hard-eyed glance.  Hummel takes a lap around Mason, sizing him up.   \n[10]\t\tPrepare for launch General?  General?    \n[11]\t\tEleven fifty-seven, General.  Three minutes to go.    \n[12]\t\tI understand it.  They're calling our bluff.  We have two \t\toperational rockets left.  We have to stick one of those rockets in \t\ttheir ear, General.    \n[13]\t\tAuthorize the launch, General.   Hummel nods and    \n[14]\t\t The problem is now thev know it.  \n[15]\t\tI'm relieving you of your command General.  Captain Frye?   \n[16]\t\t Major?  Major  Baxter looks from Darrow to Hummel.  \n[17]\t\tGive that to me.  \n[18]\t\tYou know how this shit works?   Darrow advances on Goodspeed.  The only route to GOODSPEED is between the rocket and the window.  Darrow continues advancing., GOODSPEED eyes the launcher's IGNITION SWITCH.  As Darrow passes between thewindow and the launcher ....    \n[19]\t\tI hate it.   Darrow lunges. GOODSPEED stabs the IGNITION SWITCH.  The VX ROCKET LIFTS OFF, HITTING Darrow square in the chest.   ", "Sergeant": "", "Crisp": "\n[1]\t\tThis is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and \t\tinfiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my \t\tprisoners, sir.  The marines begin cuffing the Army Guards to the radiator and taping their mouths.    \n[2]\t\tSorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.    \n[3]\t\tBig problem.  \n[4]\t\tGeneral!  This man's weapons and tac radio are missing!    ", "Scarpetti": ""}}
