They tumble to the floor.  \tIn the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his \tjacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire. \tJohn's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.  \tParker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does \tthe same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet \tthrough his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's. \tParker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.  \tParker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in \tthe stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in \tthe background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath. \tAnother kick drops Parker to his knees.  ", "Donovan": "", "Lindenmeyer": "\n[1]\t\tI did fix it.. I told you I did. I \t\tdon't know why it happened again.  \n[2]\t\t\t \t\tHow much do you think I care?  \tParker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at \tLindenmeyer.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tDon't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!  \tHe flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a \tman who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've \tbeen standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer \tand throw him to the ground.  \tLindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put \tParker in handcuffs and leg chains.  \n[4]\t\t\t \t\tDid you recognize the son-of-a \t\tbitch who got away?  \n[5]\t\tThink hard -- it'll come to you...  \tWallace enters briskly.  \n[6]\t\tThe reason you insisted on testing \t\tmy system with prisoners is because \t\tof the increased risks involved \t\twith increased realism.  \n[7]\t\tI'm still making adjustments...  \n[8]\t\t\t \n[9]\t\t\t \t\tI understand... I understand \t\tperfectly.  \tWallace ignores him as he walks toward the door. On the \tmonitors, Sid 6.7 starts walking toward you. Into a CLOSEUP.  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\tHe hears...everything.  \n[11] \tLindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the \tvirtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving \thimself a manicure.  \n[12]\t\tAll they want to produce around \t\there is mediocrity!  \n[13]\t\t\t \t\tIt was you, wasn't it?  \n[14]\t\tYou amped the neural connectors \t\tback up, didn't you? \t\t\t \t\tYou're the reason the convict died. \t\tYou're the reason I got fired!  \n[15]\t\t\t \t\tMy God...  \n[16]\t\tWhat do you expect me to do, put \t\tyour character module in my pocket \t\tand just walk you out of here?  \n[17]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Reilly, Sheila 3.2's been \t\tasking for you...  \n[18]\t\tShow's over unless I get to see \t\twhat you've been working on after \t\thours.  \n[19]\t\t\t \t\tDo I get to see it or not?  \n[20]\t\tAll my work is my finest.  \tSid 6.7 continues appreciating Sheila 3.2. As Reilly races \tback in, the monitors then all go BLACK.  \tReilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's \thead. He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's \tface. Terrifying him.  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tGet that fucking thing away from \t\tme!  \n[22]\t\t\t \t\tIt's nano\u0097technology, isn't it? \t\tMachines the size of molecules...  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\tIt feels so.. .real.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\tThis is supposed to be years away.  \n[25]\t\t\t \t\tHow do you kill it?  \n[26]\t\tAmazing. I hate to say it, but it \t\tis.  \n[27]\t\tI think I understand what you have \t\tin mind...  \tPeeling the label off the Sid 6.7 character module, \tLindenmeyer removes the module from its slot. Sid 6.7 \tdisappears from the screen.  \n[28]\t\tYou need a maid.  \n[29]\n[30] \tin Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a \tspace across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front \tof them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if \tLindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.  \n[31] \tMadison races through the broken front door to find Parker \tchecking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for \tMadison to freeze and be silent.  \tParker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. \tHis every movement is now that of a predator.  \tMadison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She \tdoes not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.  \n[32] \tIt's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. \tCluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, \tbooks, folders, disks, and tapes.  \tWhat you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to \tDIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, \tterrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, \tanarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the \tmethodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the \tautobiographies of human villainy.  \tCLASSICAL MUSIC and life\u0097like SOUND EFFECTS can be heard \tcoming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. \tHe holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her \tpulse.  \n[33] \tLooking around the room, Madison shakes her head.  \n[34] \tMadison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips \tthrough CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.  \n[35] \twatching the news on a pocket TV on a wooden bench that \tmorning. Both proud and horrified at the monster he has \tunleashed upon the world. You hear CLASSICAL MUSIC in the \tbackground.  \tLindenmeyer begins to laugh. Uncontrollably. The sounds \techoing. As WE PULL BACK, you realize the bench is one of \tmany inside the Hollywood Bowl.  \tLindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands. He \tglances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic \tas they rehearse for an upcoming performance.  \tWhatever the event is, it's going to be big. Dozens of \ttechnicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras, \tmicrophones, etc. for a live, pay\u0097per\u0097view broadcast.  \n[36]\t\t\t \t\tThere is only one way to get any \t\tmore information out of Sid 6.7...  \tThey scan the area for a new mode of transport. And find one \tstopped at a dumpster down the block: the garbage truck.  \n[37] \tParker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the \tsimulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull \tcap, just like he was before.  \tThe Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's \tmain console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next \tto him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.  \tThey are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in \tfront of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable \tpain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside \tthe entire facility.  \n[38]\t\tI told you this would work.. By \t\tsetting back the clocks, he has \t\tabsolutely no idea he's in virtual \t\treality. He still thinks he's in \t\tthe real world.  \n[39]\t\t\t \t\tHow should I know?  \n[40]\t\tI wonder how that...  \n[41]\t\tHe's developing a hemisphere \t\timbalance.  \n[42]\t\tIf I don't adjust the level of \t\tneural information each side of his \t\tbrain is receiving, he won't be \t\table to walk when I take him out of \n[43]\t\tI need you to hold this. It can't \t\tget any dirt on it.  \tMadison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do. \tLindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free \thand.  \n[44]\t\tAll you have to do is hold the \t\tneedle at the base. Just make sure \t\tnot to jab yourself with the \t\tpoint...  \tShe clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun \twith her right. Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector \tfrom Parker's skull.  \tHolding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes \tseveral adjustments on the neural management computer, then \tmoves slowly back to Madison.  \n[45]\t\tHand me the connector nice and...  \tHe suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right \tforearm. Madison has no time to react. 10,000 volts of \telectricity instantly courses through her body.  \tMadison drops to the floor, unconscious. The needle she had \tbeen holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit. She \tstops being electrocuted. Which saves her life.  \n[46]\t\t\t \t\tGod, some people are stupid.  \tHe sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts \tto type commands. On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting \tthe shopping mall.  \n[47]\t\t\t \t\tShe's taking a nap at the moment.  \tHe types a set of instructions into the console and hits \n[48]\t\tBut don't worry. You won't be alone \t\tfor very long. Fairly soon, you'll \t\tbe dead.  \tHe removes the Sid 6.7 character module from its slot and \texits the station.  \n[49]\t\tCome on, live. Live!  \tThe synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life. \tGrowing around the module. Forming the beginnings of a new \thead. Literally.  \n[50] \tMadison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe \tParker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least, \tstarting to.  \n[51]\t\tOf course you are.  \tSid 6.7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer.  \n[52]\t\tHelp me get out of here.  \n[53]\t\t\t \t\tWhat...are you doing?!  \tSid 6.7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands.  \n[54]\t\tI'm begging you...please don't kill \t\tme! Please!  \n[55] \tMadison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it \tas she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter \tterror.  \n[56] \tMadison keeps pressing the return button over and over, \tmaking sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to \tconsciousness. Madison rushes to him.  ", "Karin": "\n[1]\t\tMommy's home! Mommy's home!  \tKarin's BABY-SITTER opens the door for Madison as she carries \ther daughter inside.  \tParker stares from squad car in surprise. Even disbelief. He \thad no idea Madison was a mother.  \tMoments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front \tsteps. Staring at Parker. With fascination. Curiosity. \tWondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a \tpolice car outside her house. But not saying a word.  \tParker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation \twith her. A multitude of expressions passing over his face as \tmemories of his own daughter flash through his mind.  ", "Carter": "", "Elizabeth": "\n[1] \tlooking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in \tfront of her inside the Viewing Room.  ", "Deane": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tWhat did Cox pull him out early \t\tfor?  \n[2]\t\t\t \t\tDon't remind me.  \tLAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the \ttwo unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the \tcaps. You can now see the faces of the participants:  \tParker and John.  \tParker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually \treturns to consciousness. He looks very different than his \tvirtual rendering:  \tHis hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar \tacross his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a \tfilthy prison uniform.  \tJohn's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as \tclean\u0097cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is \tconvulsing. Violently.  \tHis flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around \thim. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly. \tFrightening.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tWhat the hell happened?  \n[4]\t\t\t \t\tSimulations are supposed to give \t\tparticipants practice in realistic, \t\tdangerous scenarios while \t\tprotecting them from the risks they \t\tare exposed to in the real world.  \n[5]\t\tAgain?!  \n[6]\t\t\t \t\tWhy wasn't I told?  \n[7]\t\tThen about all I've spent $37 \t\tmillion developing is a very \t\texpensive way to control the prison \t\tpopulation.  \tAfter giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand \tstitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded \tcufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You \tnow notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is \tnow empty. She left a while ago.  \tCox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as \tif it were his child. There are several scratches, but no \tmajor damage. He looks relieved.  \n[8]\t\tI watched your simulation, Mr. \t\tBarnes. Very impressive. You know, \t\tyou're the only one to ever go up \t\tagainst Sid 6.7 who is still alive.  \n[9]\t\tNobody else ever got anywhere near \t\thim. Nobody else... understands him \t\tlike you do.  \tParker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index finger \tcircularly, as in get on with it, already. Cox opens a folder \tand shows Parker several PHOTOGRAPHS of Reilly, or what was \tleft of him.  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\tYou mean a nano\u0097tech synthetic \t\torganism.  \n[11]\t\tThink you can do it?  \n[12]\t\t\t \t\tThis is a full pardon. It \t\tauthorizes your immediate release.  \tShe slides an unsigned pardon across the table to Parker, \tmaking sure to stay beyond his arm's reach. Cox reveals a \tworn, L. A. P. D. badge. It was Parker's.  \n[13]\t\t\t \t\tCatch him and your record's clean.  \n[14]\t\tIf Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we \t\tthrow you back in here and you \t\tserve out the rest of your \t\tsentence.  \n[15]\t\tThis is the newest technology \t\tapproved for general \t\timplementation. It's called a \t\tlocater implant. Every parolee gets \t\tone. \t\t\t \t\tWe're going to know where you are \t\tevery second for the rest of your \t\tlife.  \n[16]\t\t\t \t\tYes or no, Mr. Barnes?  \n[17]\t\tBut only you will know he's not \t\thuman.  \tParker's expression is one of \u0097\u0097 yeah, that figures. Madison \tenters. She cannot see Parker behind the barber.  \n[18]\t\tWe have an emergency situation \t\twhich requires somebody with \t\texpertise in criminal psychology. \t\tUnder the authority vested in me by \t\tthe President, I'm giving you \t\ttemporary re\u0097assignment.  \n[19]\t\tYou're going to put your theories \t\tto practice. I'm sending you into \t\tthe field.  \tThe barber moves back from Parker, revealing his clean\u0097 \tshaven face. It takes Madison a moment to recognize him with \this cleaned\u0097up appearance.  \n[20] \tlooking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in \tfront of her inside the Viewing Room.  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tThat's also where Mr. Barnes lost \t\this arms to Mathew Grimes' booby\u0097 \t\ttrap. What's your point, Dr. \t\tCarter?  \n[22]\t\tNot if you're with him every step \t\tof the way.  \n[23]\t\tI understand the risks involved \t\there. But there is nobody better \t\tqualified to go after Sid 6.7 than \t\tBarnes. And, there is nobody who \t\tknows him better than you. If a \t\tsituation becomes volatile, you \t\twill find a way to quell it. I have \t\tcomplete confidence in you.  \n[24]\t\tWhat are they doing in Los Feliz?  \n[25]\t\tWhy would they be going there?  \n[26]\t\tI wish we could hear them.  \n[27]\t\t\t \t\tNeither will the public. \t\t\t \t\tThe media has caught wind of his \t\tpardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts \t\tgiving me some tangible results, \t\tI'm going to put him back in his \t\tcage.  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\tYou were right, Dr. Carter. Letting \t\ta lunatic like Barnes loose in the \t\treal world did pose an unacceptably \t\tdangerous risk to the public. \t\t\t \t\tI should have never tried to solve \t\tone problem by allowing the \t\tcreation of another. \t\t\t \t\tChief Cox will give you a ride back \t\tto the station. You will provide \t\thim with any and all information \t\tyou have developed thus far. \t\t\t \t\tEnjoy the rest of your sentence, \t\tMr. Barnes.  \tShe exits. Cox and Parker stand facing each other. Cox wishes \tthere was something he could do. Parker looks completely out \tof it. Cox extends his hand. After a moment, Parker takes it. \tBut his mind is way off elsewhere.  \n[29]\t\tHe would slaughter eight people \t\tsitting in a room, but not two \t\tprison guards?  \n[30]\t\tYou already have staked your \t\treputation. \t\t\t \t\tMayor Bennett and I have been \t\tfriends a long time. Since Grimes \t\ttried to kill him, it doesn't take \t\ta rocket scientist to come to the \t\tconclusion that Sid 6.7 might go \t\tafter him, too. \t\t\t \t\tBennett's Re-Election Rally is \t\ttomorrow night and we already have \t\tenough trouble on our hands with \t\tone psychotic on the loose. \t\t\t \t\tThe fail-safe on\u0097line, yet?  \n[31]\t\t\t \t\tThis had better work, Mr. Wallace.  \tWallace exits the room. Cox has no idea what is going on. And \tDeane is not about to tell him.  \n[32]\t\tBarnes, where the hell have you \t\tbeen?!  \n[33]\t\tWhat did you find out?  \n[34]\t\tIt's already been called off. \t\tWitnesses confirmed you weren't the \t\tshooter. \t\t\t \t\tDid you find out where the bomb is?  \n[35]\t\tEnough to level an entire city \t\tblock.  \n[36]\t\t Demolition teams \t\thave searched everywhere in and \t\taround the hotel. I don't know \t\twhere...  \n[37]\t\tYou know how much man power you're \t\ttalking about?  \n[38]\t\t\t \t\tThis better not be a wild goose \t\tchase.  \n[39]\t\t\t \t\tDon't forget, convict, if this \t\tpsycho isn't stopped, you go right \t\tback to rotting in a prison cell.  \n[40]\t\tThank God.  \n[41]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's the problem?

It \"dies.\"  \n[14]\t\t... and you get nano\u0097death. \t\t\t \t\tDon't worry, I've got a bunch of \t\tother ones.  \n[15]\t\tI know. \t\t\t \t\tI'm ready to incubate something a \t\tlittle more advanced than a \t\tcoldblooded reptile. If you want to \t\texperience the future, meet me in \t\tmy office in 15 minutes. And bring \t\tthe Sheila 3.2 character module \t\twith you...  \tHe exits. As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3.2 character \tmodule, Sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front of him and \twinks.  \n[16] \topening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes \tlater. Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him \tand leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry. \tAs well as a large aquarium full of nano\u0097pythons.  \n[17]\t\tWhat I need is a nymphomaniac.  \tHe removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank \twith a circular window in the middle of it.  \tClear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of \tincreasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in \telectrified fluid. The tubing is a synthetic human nervous \tsystem.  \n[18] \tReilly turns to Lindenmeyer.  \n[19]\t\tWhere's the Sheila 3.2 module?  \tLindenmeyer hands him the label\u0097less character module. Reilly \topens the \"incubator.\"  \n[20] \tLindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.  \n[21]\t\tIt feeds on what is basically \t\tamniotic fluid. \t\t\t \t\tIn eight hours, we are going to \t\thave ourselves one hell of a play \t\ttoy.  \tOff Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we  \n[22] \tReilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.  \tLindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.  \tIt's close to 4:00 AM.  \n[23] \tThe human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours \tout from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.  \tThe figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its \tsurroundings.  \tReilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father \tabout to see his newborn child for the first time. \tLindenmeyer hangs back.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\tBaby, what I'm gonna do to you...  \tHis face drops when Sid 6.7 steps out of the mist.  \tCompletely naked. Lindenmeyer smiles proudly. Fearfully. \tWickedly.  \n[25]\t\t\t \t\tWho the hell is this?!  \n[26]\t\t\t \t\tThis... isn't.. .possible!  ", "SID": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tI'm going to rehearse with your \t\tfriend a while, then I'll be back \t\tto perform a new piece with you.  \tHe grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, \tknocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over \this shoulder.  \n[2]\t\tIf you get hungry, I'd recommend \t\tthe escargot. They're delicious.  \tHe carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. \tParker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.  \n[3] \tParker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who \twork undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.  \tParker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the \taisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of \ta frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front \tof his own as a shield.  \n[4]\t\tPerforming solo. \t\t\t \t\tEnjoying the concert so far?  \tAdvancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with \this good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs \twatch the showdown.  \n[5]\t\t. \t\tYou and me aren't so different, \t\tafter all...  \tParker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No \tbullets.  \n[6]\t\tLike a violin without strings...  \tHe takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from \tinside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble \tover something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through \tits zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a \tbowling ball.  \tBeside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. \tHis hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is \tbeing electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in \ttime.  \n[7]\t\tI told you I was going to perform a \t\tnew piece with you. It's called, \t\t\"First You Suffer, Then You Die.\" \t\tHope you like it.  \tParker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE\u0097 \tMATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.  \n[8]\t\t\t \t\tNOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm \t\tnot finished!  \tJohn's body also de\u0097materializes as Parker disappears \tentirely.  \tThe blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and \tstarts retracting into his body. Along with his bone \tfragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your \tvery eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is  \n[9] \ta/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research \tbuilding in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.  \tThe look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech \tsparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires, \tcables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.  \tIn complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the \tknow, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the \tworld.  \tThe building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each \tstation, a leading engineer in his field is frantically \treadying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology \tdesigned to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.  \tThe atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension, \tanticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their \tinventions approved for production.  \tLETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from \t1994.  \tAt a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS \tBODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps \tmade of polyurethane.  \tEach skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it \tat points designated as neural primes. Each needle is \tdirectly connected to the participant's nervous system.  \tThe tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic \twire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers \tsurrounding the beds.  \tEach of these components isn't much to look at on its own. \tBut together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of \tsomething very new \u0097\u0097 a revolutionary law enforcement \ttraining device whose name you read:  \n[10] \tThe building is heavily-guarded. Razor wire, land mines, \tarmed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere \tnear here.  \tCox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport. \tThe two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the \ttransport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps \tshort.  \n[11] \tCold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only \tpassenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.  \n[12] \tStanding outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's \tshoulder.  \n[13] \tParker sits in DARKNESS as the transport begins its trek. The \tonly light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel \tmesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him.  \n[14] \tSid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around the \troom as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.  \n[15]\t\t\t \t\tDon't be angry with me, Daryl.  \n[16]\t\tShould I have?  \n[17]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Wallace, you really think you \t\tcan shut me down?  \tWallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.  \n[18] \tWallace walks toward the building's entrance. His footsteps \tECHO. His cellular phone RINGS.  \n[19]\t\t\t \t\tAs a matter of fact, little man, \t\tyou're wrong. I think, therefore, I \t\tam.  \tClick. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone \tin disbelief.  \n[20] \tParker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint. He \tis ordered to remove his clothing.  \tHe stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he \tis strip searched. Every portion of the body in which someone \tcould hide something is closely inspected.  \tWithout being graphic, we watch the de\u0097humanizing procedure. \tHe opens his mouth as wide as possible. Pulls his earlobes \tforeword to reveal behind them. Then bends over, hands on the \tfloor in front of him.  \tHe is scanned with a metal detector. So is his clothing, \twhich is then returned to him.  \n[21] \tParker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates. The food \tis unrecognizable. The air thick with humidity and cigarette \tsmoke. Nobody is talking. Just staring. At Parker.  \tParker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns \this utensils to a bin. And heads to the bathroom. All eyes \tfollowing Parker's every move.  \tThe other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of \tincredible size following Parker. 6' 6\", 255 lbs. His face \tcovered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago. \tThis is BIG RED. He follows Parker into the bathroom.  \n[22] \tGraffiti covers the walls. Red uses a stained urinal, then \tturns to the stalls. A pair of prison\u0097issue shoes and socks \tare visible beneath one of them.  \n[23] \tThe room isn't clean. The technology is outdated. A large, \tfemale NURSE applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin \ton Parker's fingers.  \n[24] \tLindenmeyer storms in angrily. Sid 6.7 is visible on the \tvirtual reality monitors around the simulator. He's giving \thimself a manicure.  \n[25]\t\tTrue genius is rarely rewarded \t\twithin its lifetime.  \n[26]\t\t\t \t\tIt was me, what?  \n[27]\t\tI couldn't just let them make you \t\tbring down my degree of difficulty. \t\tI'm a triple-twisting, double back \t\tflip off the high platform, not a \t\tswan dive.  \n[28]\t\tWhich God would that be, the one \t\twho created me, or the one who \t\tcreated you? \t\t\t \t\tIn your world, the Lord giveth, and \t\tthe Lord taketh away. But in my \t\tworld, the one who gave me life \t\tdoesn't have the balls to stop a \t\tcouple of bureaucratic assholes \t\tfrom taking it away.  \n[29]\t\tI had something a little different \t\tin mind. \t\t\t \t\tInstead of just playing Peeping Tom \t\twith Reilly, why don't you get him \t\tto show you what he's been working \t\ton after hours?  \tLindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and \tdials an extension.  \n[30] \tReilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he \tcould touch the contours of Sheila 3.2's body.  \n[31]\t\tShe's some of your finest work, \t\tDaryl.  \n[32]\t\tYou catching my drift?  \n[33] \tReilly turns to Lindenmeyer.  \n[34] \tReilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the \tsynthetic nervous system.  \tThe polymer neural net instantly crackles with life. It grows \taround the module. Cells  immediately begin \tadhering to the tubing. Forming the beginnings of a skeletal \tarchitecture.  \n[35] \tLindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window.  \n[36] \tIt's night. Light is dim. His bed is empty. The wall next to \tit is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards \tsent each year by Chief Cox.  \tThe other two walls in the cell, however, look very \tdifferent. They are completely covered with primitive \tpaintings \u0097\u0097 darkly colored, surreal images. Imagine the \tLascaux cave paintings as works\u0097in\u0097progress. Painted by Dali. \tExcept these images were created by Parker Barnes.  \tHe kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image. \tCompletely lost in concentration. His hands, his clothing, \tcovered in paint. He almost appears to be part of the art \twork.  \tThe work is intricate. It clearly takes Parker a very long \ttime. Which gives him something to do during the nights he is \tunable to sleep. Which is most of them.  \tHe is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the \tconstant taunts ECHOING throughout the cell block. Threats of \tthe ugliest, most vile kind. The kind Parker has had to live \twith every night for the last five years.  \tPausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts.  \tHis face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger.  \tParker immediately resumes painting.  \n[37] \tReilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later.  \tLindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious.  \tIt's close to 4:00 AM.  \n[38] \tThe human form inside incubator opens the hatch. Steam pours \tout from within its confines as it climbs out slowly.  \tThe figure stands within the mist, admiring itself. Then its \tsurroundings.  \tReilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father \tabout to see his newborn child for the first time. \tLindenmeyer hangs back.  \n[39]\t\tMy name is Sid. Sid 6.7.  \tHe extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the \tthroat and chokes him. Hard.  \n[40] \n[41]\t\tWhat do you expect me to do, thank \t\thim?  \n[42]\t\tSure it is \u0097- and it's all thanks \t\tto the many long hours put in by \t\tyou and Daryl.  \tHe watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains \tfrom it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body \tto the floor.  \n[43]\t\t\t ) \t\tReal instruments are so much more \t\tresponsive than virtual ones, don't \t\tyou think?  \tLindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is \tunlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you \trealize something isn't quite right.  \tHis expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, \tbut it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.  \tThe billions of nano\u0097mechanisms which make up his anatomy are \tstill learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. \tSid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.  \tIn various ways throughout his \"life\" \u0097\u0097 be it a wandering \teye, or a momentary limp \u0097- you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 \tis a synthetic nano\u0097organism unlike anyone has ever seen.  \tA surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. \tPicking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor\u0097 \tsharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood \tappears. Sid 6.7 tastes his  blood.  \n[44]\t\tTastes different, somehow.  \tHe then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, \thealing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.  \n[45]\t\tI think I'm going to like it here.  \tGlancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office \tdoor in our face.  \n[46] \t6:00 AM. Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room \tby a guard, who then exits. Waiting for Parker are Chief of \tPolice Cox and Elizabeth Deane.  \n[47] \tParker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a \tSURGEON drills a small hole into his skull. The surgeon \tinserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole.  \tParker's brain is displayed on a monitor. The surgeon uses \tthe image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater \timplant into Parker's brain.  \n[48] \tCox and Deane watch the operation through a large window.  \tMadison enters, carrying a folder labelled:\tINMATE #673429 \tA/K/A PARKER BARNES. She withdraws several PHOTOGRAPHS from \tthe folder, placing the first one in front of Deane.  \n[49] \tAs Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head \tis tested. Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic \tmap to within one inch of his present location. The hole in \this skull is then stitched shut.  \n[50] \tParker presents his identification to a GUARD, then drives \tthrough the final checkpoint. Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's \tfile.  \n[51] \tParker gets out of the car. Madison follows suit.  \n[52] \tInvestigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every \tdevice imaginable. Parker and Madison survey the scene with \tnothing but their eyes.  \tLying in the middle of the living room are the four victims:  \tthe affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive. Their \tbodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's. Except \ttheir heads have been interchanged.  \tParker and Madison turn their attention to a message written \tin blood on a wall. It reads: DEATH TO THE PIGS.  \n[53] \tin Culver City. Magic hour. Parker pulls the squad car into a \tspace across the street. Hitting the vehicle parked in front \tof them. In which two UNDERCOVER COPS sit waiting to see if \tLindenmeyer returns. Parker waves apologetically.  \n[54] \tMadison races through the broken front door to find Parker \tchecking his weapon. Before she can speak, he motions for \tMadison to freeze and be silent.  \tParker hears Something. Something moving inside the duplex. \tHis every movement is now that of a predator.  \tMadison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse. She \tdoes not handle it with confidence. Parker shakes his head.  \n[55] \tIt's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here. \tCluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, \tbooks, folders, disks, and tapes.  \tWhat you notice, however, is that ALL THE DATA relates to \tDIFFERENT KINDS of CRIMINALS: serial killers, mass murderers, \tterrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, \tanarchists, you name it, it's here. The psychology of, the \tmethodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the \tautobiographies of human villainy.  \tCLASSICAL MUSIC and life\u0097like SOUND EFFECTS can be heard \tcoming from a computer. This is what Parker has been hearing. \tHe holsters his sidearm. So does Madison. Who checks her \tpulse.  \n[56] \tLooking around the room, Madison shakes her head.  \n[57] \tMadison stares at the computer screen in awe. Parker flips \tthrough CD-ROM hard copies of the different versions of Sid.  \n[58] \tbeing inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer \tLab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV \tBORGEN, 60s, the \"grand old wizard\" of the facility. Parker \tand Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers \tare everywhere.  \n[59]\t\t\t \t\tThe Dahmer part of me wants to boil \t\tyou for dinner. The Manson part \t\twants to recruit you to become part \t\tof my family. \t\t\t \t\tYou know what the Berkowitz part of \t\tme wants to do?  \tHe raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But \tdoes NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid \tchange of expression \u0097\u0097 as if a battle for control of his \temotions were going on.  \tRegaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back. \tReflecting.  \n[60]\t\tCraft can only become art when the \t\tcreator sets his sights on \t\tsomething never yet achieved... \t\t\t \t\tLike an apprentice about to become \t\ta master, the imitator is about to \t\tbecome an originator.  \tHe pockets his weapon and walks  \n[61] \tThe bartender is a low-tech ROBO-TENDER. PATRONS sit quietly, \tdrinking themselves into oblivion. Sid 6.7 takes a seat next \tto an BUSINESSMAN slumped at the bar.  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\tEver have one of those days where \t\tyou decide something important \t\tabout yourself? You know, where you \t\tsay, \"I'm not just what I've been \t\tprogrammed to be. I can do what I \t\twant, when I want, how I want, \t\tbecause I'm my own person?\"  \n[63]\t\tJust a soul on a personal journey. \t\tWhat I've realized is that I'm \t\tcapable of anything. I have to \t\tstart expanding my horizons...  \tThe Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7.  \n[64]\t\tTo think you constitute one of my \t\tancestors\u0097\u0097  \tHe shoots the Robo\u0097Tender between his mechanical eyes. The \tbusinessman smiles, like he's thought about doing exactly the \tsame thing.  \n[65]\t\tYou know, you're absolutely right. \t\t\t \t\tWould you mind sitting over there?  \tHe points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN.  \n[66]\t\tEvery orchestra is divided into \t\tsections. Like instruments sit with \t\tlike instruments. Now be a good \t\tinstrument and sit with your \t\tkind...  \tHe lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to \tthe table.  \n[67] \tParker drives through a residential neighborhood. 9 PM. \tMadison points to a house on the right.  \n[68] \tMadison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is \timmediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts \tout of the front door and leaps into her arms.  \n[69] \tMadison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via \tmodem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library. \tShe rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the \tleader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the \tCharles Manson of technological terrorism.  \n[70] \tMadison stares gravely into the screen.  \n[71] \tParker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence. \tHe smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so \tdoes he.  \tMadison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her \tdaughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin \twaves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's \tbabysitter then leads her back inside the house.  \n[72] \tMadison gets in, immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling \tfrom the steering wheel. Parker has been free the entire \ttime.  \n[73] \tSid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate groups: \tolder men and woman, and younger men and woman. All are \tfrozen in their seats with fear.  \tSid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his \tarm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a \tbaton. Sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror. He \tdelights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power over \tthem.  \n[74]\t\tGood... Very good... Nice... \t\t\t \t\tYou -- in the middle -- don't hold \t\tback. Give it to me!  \tHe fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror.  \n[75]\t\tThat's better...  \tHe continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever \tincreasing emotional responses from his \"instruments.\" A guy \tentering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time \tSid 6.7 glances at the door.  \n[76]\t\tGod, I hate interruptions. \t\t\t  \tOnce again, from the top\u0097\u0097 BOOM! He shoots again, just \tmissing a man's foot.  \n[77] \tParker drinks his coffee black. Madison adds two creams, two \tsugars. The cackling from the police radio continues \tunabated.  \n[78] \tSid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young WOMAN \tsitting among several others. You hear the sound of tires \tSCREECHING to a halt outside.  \tSid 6.7 remains unconcerned. He toys with the Woman, pointing \tthe gun in her face, then pulling it back. Her expression \tchanges instantly. Dramatically.  \n[79]\t\tI just love how responsive you are.  \n[80]\t\t\t \t\tThe ushers were not supposed to \t\tseat you until intermission.  \n[81]\t\tThank you, ladies and gentlemen, \t\tyou've been a real pleasure...  \tAs he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror \tbehind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the \treal world before. He likes what he sees.  \n[82] \tStreet traffic is much lighter here. Sid 6.7 exits, getting \tinto the vacant police car left by the cops.  \n[83] \tSid 6.7 adjusts his seat. The rearview mirror. Glancing at \thimself. Then behind him.  \n[84] \tSid 6.7 looks pleased.  \n[85]\t\tWell, look who it...  \tCRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches \tthe gas, taking off in a hurry.  \n[86] \tParker races after Sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously. \tWITHOUT CARE for the innocent MOTORISTS nearby. They SCREAM \tin absolute terror, but remain unharmed. Physically, anyway.  \tParker gives up the chase of Sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in \tthe other direction. Toward Madison as she rounds the corner \tin their squad car.  \n[87] \tHe opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over.  \n[88] \tParker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce \tdetermination. Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and \texcitement. She holds onto the door handle for dear life.  \n[89]\t\t\t ) \t\tGlad to see you're on the case, \t\tOfficer Barnes. Or should I say, \t\tinmate 673429...  \n[90] \tSid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around \twhich Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass \tSHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window.  \n[91]\t\t\t \t\tThe symphony of collision...  \n[92]\t\tI must make them very nervous if \t\tthey let you out of prison. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, we have so much in common \t\t\u0097\u0097 we have such history together \t\t\u0097\u0097I've been thinking we should \t\tbecome friends.  \tMadison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity.  \n[93]\t\tWho else do you know who touches \t\tthe world with synthetic hands?  \tParker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel. \tMadison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation \twhile driving like this.  \n[94]\t\tWho else do you know who's been \t\tlocked out of the real world for \t\tyears, and is now just learning to \t\tbe free? \t\t\t \t\tWho else do you know is a multiple \t\tmurderer just like you? Who else...  \tMadison clicks off the radio.  \n[95]\t\t\t \t\tMy badge is in my jacket. Left \t\tpocket.  \n[96]\t\tGod, some people are stupid.  \tHe aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.  \n[97] \tMadison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6.7, as \tParker speeds toward the gridlock.  \n[98] \tin the L. A. P. D. Downtown Headquarters the next morning. \tChief Cox stares angrily at Parker. Madison sits next to him. \tBehind them is a mirrored wall.  \n[99] \tWallace and Deane look on through the two\u0097way mirror. Deane \tis on the phone.  \n[100] \tThe TV is one of many mounted above the check\u0097out counters. \tCUSTOMERS waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the \tnews with varying degrees of horror, disgust, curiosity, and \tfear.  \tThe stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6.7 enjoys it. He \tis waiting in line holding a box of Twinkies.  \n[101]\t\t\t \t\tSo was I.  \tOff the cashier's look, we  \n[102] \twalking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front \tcatches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured \tby a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing \toutside a large electronics store.  \tSid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSE\u0097UP.  \tHe is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.  \tThis is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.  \n[103] \tDozens of TVs on display. There is a different channel on \teach. The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming. Sid 6.7 \tenters, making his way to a big screen TV with the local news \tin progress.  \n[104]\t\t\t \t\tDon't you two make a pretty couple.  \tThe news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7 \twiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.  \n[105]\t\tWe really do have so much in \t\tcommon. But I refuse to be \t\tupstaged...  \tHe changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A \treporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7 \thad terrified the patrons.  \tSid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of \tthem are watching other channels. He goes over to a control \tpad on a counter and presses several buttons.  \tNow EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter \toutside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi \tswastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the \tTVs to a Dodger baseball game.  \tSid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel \tback to the news.  \n[106]\t\t\t \t\tTake me out to the ball game... \t\tTake me out for the fun...  \tHe places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently \tsnaps his head around, breaking his neck.  \n[107]\t\tBuy me some peanuts and Cracker \t\tJack... I don't care if I ever come \t\tback...  \tHe drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his \teyes off the TV.  \n[108] \tSid 6.7 watches the TV intently, completely ignoring the \thorrified customers circling around him because of the dead \tSkinhead at his feet. A SALESMAN, who'd been demonstrating a \tvideocamera, tapes Sid 6.7 from behind a customer.  \n[109]\t\t\t \t\tI'm sorry I can't do more for you. \t\t\t \t\tPublic service really isn't my \t\tforte.  \tHe walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then \treaches out of frame to help the increasingly\u0097shaky salesman \tsteady the camera.  \n[110]\t\tBut rest assured... \t\t\t \t\tA star is born.  \tWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid \t6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen \tother COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The \ttape is re\u0097wound.  \n[111]\t\t\t \t\tBut rest assured... \t\t\t \t\tA star is born.  \n[112] \tHe grabs a police radio from a nearby OFFICER.  \n[113] \tOn the massive screen over left field, the Woman in CLOSE-UP \tlooks embarrassed, trying to forget her face is now 40 feet \thigh for all the other fans to see.  \n[114] \tThe Woman's face appears on various monitors. The phone \tRINGS. No one answers it. The room appears to be empty.  \tThe stadium's closed-circuit TV director is not in his chair.  \tHe's lying dead on the floor.  \n[115] \tenjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he \tchokes the life out of the Woman.  \n[116]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you...  \tHis words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's \tneck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they \tcharge him.  \n[117]\t\tThat's all, folks.  \tHe leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads \tout of the seating area.  \n[118] \tPeople bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the \tstadium as L. A. P. D. squad cars approach in the distance. \tThe car in the lead is Parker's.  \n[119] \tParker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto \tthe street. Madison braces herself.  \n[120] \tParker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who \tkeep right on running. Parker jumps out of the vehicle, \tscanning faces. In predator mode. Madison gets out, clearly \tshaken. Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.  \n[121] \tParker and Madison hop the turnstiles. Only to be stopped by \ta remote\u0097controlled, box\u0097shaped robotic sentry, which is \tidentical to one you have seen before. This sentry was one of \tReilly's creations at LETAC.  \n[122]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's wrong, convict, your arms \t\tneed adjusting? Or maybe it's your \t\thead. Maybe you aren't ready to be \t\tback out in the real world, yet...  \n[123] \tMadison looks in both directions as she gets off the \tescalator. Parker is nowhere to be seen.  \tMoving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who \tclutches his bleeding shoulder. He is shivering. Going into \tshock. Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones.  \n[124] \t30 minutes later. The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has \tsubsided. Madison and two PARAMEDICS lead the bandaged \tCollege Student to an ambulance.  \tMadison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself. Elbows \ton his knees. Head between his hands. Staring at the cement \tbetween his feet.  \n[125]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you... \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you...  \tAs Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking \tat the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure \tanger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt. \tThe beast within has been unleashed.  \n[126] \tCox and Madison head back toward L. A. P. D. Headquarters. \tThey are in mid\u0097conversation:  \n[127] \tParker sits alone in the darkness. Motionless. Until the \tsound of TWO GUNSHOTS piercing the transport's front \twindshield SHATTERS the silence.  \n[128]\t\t\t \t\tHey, old buddy, old pal, good to \t\tsee you again.  \n[129] \tParker goes absolutely berserk. Viciously punching the steel \tmesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his \tknuckles is shredded.  \n[130]\t\tNow, is that any way to talk to an \t\told buddy? I mean, just because I'm \t\tcarrying around the joy of killing \t\tyour family inside me doesn't mean \t\twe can't be friends.  \n[131]\t\tI'm sorry, the party you're trying \t\tto reach is not answering. Is there \t\tanyone else you would like to talk \t\tto?  \n[132]\t\t\t \t\tYou really are pathetic, you know \t\tthat? Mathew Grimes is only one \t\tletter in my alphabet. He is \t\tnothing compared to me.  \tParker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He \tslumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can \tdo is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.  \n[133]\t\tYou could say thank\u0097you, you know? \t\tI'm giving you your freedom, short\u0097 \t\tlived though it may be. \t\t\t \t\tA little known fact about the \t\tlocater implants prison inmates now \t\treceive upon release is that they \t\tcontain a pinhead capsule of neural \t\ttoxin. \t\tThe satellite they use to track you \t\tcan also trigger release of the \t\ttoxin with microwaves. After \t\ttransmission, the implant's host \t\tdies within 30 seconds. \t\t\t \t\tIt won't take long for them to get \t\tyour termination authorized once \t\tthey learn of your escape. Now who \t\twould you rather go after, killer, \t\tthem or me?  \tHe releases the rear door lock.  \n[134] \tAn AIDE rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane \tand Wallace on what he has learned.  \n[135] \tMadison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the \tevents of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her \tclothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good \tshower, and a better massage.  \tMadison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received \talong the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used \tto sitting behind a desk, they are.  \tShe absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into \ther bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's \tlooked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she \tcomes to the same conclusion.  \tMadison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they \twould take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on \tthe TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.  \tMadison rushes in front of the television to see a report of \tParker's escape from the prison transport.  \n[136] \tIgnoring the warnings of several COPS walking toward their \tvehicles, Madison speeds toward the front entrance. She \tbarely stops in time. SCREEEECH!  \n[137] \tMadison races through the bustling facility. Looking for \tsomebody. She finally finds Cox coming out of his office.  \n[138] \tThe look on Cox's face tells you Madison has explained the \tsituation to him. He is furious.  \n[139] \tCox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power \tsupply. He points to the floor's numerous circuit breakers.  \n[140] \tThe room is still under construction. Wallace stands behind a \tTECHNICIAN sitting at a console in front of a massive \telectronic map tracking several convicts, including Parker. \tThe technician is typing in an elaborate termination code.  \n[141] \t6 PM. The human FOREMAN presses a remote control detonator.  \tBOOM! An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation  \t. The building is levelled instantly.  \tSid 6.7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the \tForeman.  \n[142]\t\t\t \t\tBravo.  \n[143]\t\tSomeone who appreciates the \t\tartistic value of high\u0097explosives.  \tHe shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of \this keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.  \n[144] \tcarrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in \tthe construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen \tcrates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.  \n[145] \tSid 6.7 secures several crates of C\u00974 to an automated sewer \tcleaning vehicle. He schedules its start time \u0097\u0097 24 hours \tfrom now. It is now 7:45 PM. The bomb's TIMER is set to \tdetonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 PM \ttomorrow night.  \n[146]\t\t\t \t\tYou think you know me, but you \t\tdon't have any idea who I really \t\tam...  \n[147] \tsight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox \tsupervises an army of L. A. P. D. officers who are securing \tthe area. Bomb\u0097sniffing dogs. Rooftop snipers. Helicopter \tsurveillance. Nothing is being left to chance.  \tAnyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is \tsearched, including the REPORTERS and their CAMERA CREWS \tcovering the convention's security.  \n[148]\t\tBe a reporter \u0097\u0097 figure it out for \t\tyourself. All I'm going to tell you \t\tis that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I \t\twill become legendary...  \n[149]\t\t\t \t\tBrings back memories, doesn't it?  \n[150]\t\t\t \t\tI wouldn't pull the trigger if I \t\twere you\u0097\u0097  \n[151] \tParker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by \tinches. Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over \tthe railing...  \n[152]\t\tI have to tell you, I do enjoy you, \t\tParker. I really don't want to have \t\tto kill you...  \tThe sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea \twhatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  \n[153]\t\tLet me put it to you this way... \t\twhether I'm here...or whether I'm \t\tnot...I'm leaving an indelible mark \t\ton the world tomorrow night.  \n[154] \tParker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation \tworker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with \ther gun. As Parker climbs up to her, Madison shuts the door \tto give them a moment of privacy.  \n[155]\t\tI have to tell you, I do enjoy you, \t\tParker. I really don't want to have \t\tto kill you...  \tThe sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea \twhatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  \tParker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal \tjaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike \tthe sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is \tprimal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per\u0097hour.  \n[156]\t\tLet me put it to you this way... \t\twhether I'm here... or whether I'm \t\tnot...I'm leaving an indelible mark \t\ton the world tomorrow night.  \n[157]\t\t\t \t\tMy...secret.  \tHe SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking \tit. Parker reels back in pain.  \tSid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged \tmetal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood \tthen begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal \tthemselves.  \n[158]\t\tToo bad you can't regenerate...  \tAs the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the \tstreet. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE \tPULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is  \n[159] \tParker lies unconscious on a bed. He is connected to the \tsimulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull \tcap, just like he was before.  \tThe Sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's \tmain console. Lindenmeyer sits at the controls. Madison next \tto him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head.  \tThey are both watching Parker chase Sid 6.7 on the monitor in \tfront of them. Parker continues experiencing intolerable \tpain. A clock reads 4:00 AM. They are the only ones inside \tthe entire facility.  \n[160] \tThe place is a seven\u0097story mecca of shopping. An atrium \tallows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. \tSid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. Going up to the second \tfloor. Then the third.  \tParker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator.  \tThrowing people out of his way.  \n[161]\t\t\t(surprised at Parker's \t\truthlessness \t\tWe really aren't that different, \t\tare we?  \tWhat he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent \tShopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the \tshopper's head.  \n[162] \tThe sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you \tget dizzy easily, close your eyes.  \n[163]\t\tMan, what a rush. \t\t\t \t\tAdios, amigo!  \tGrabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.  \n[164] \tMadison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen. Madison still \thas her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a WARNING \tLIGHT start to flash. He turns to Parker's unconscious body \tlying on the bed. Lindenmeyer looks concerned.  \n[165] \tParker races out the door. BOOM! That was left knee cap. He \ttumbles to the street. His gun flying from his hand.  \tParker crawls desperately toward his weapon. But not fast \tenough. Sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.  \n[166]\t\tSo close, and yet, so far...  \tHe kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at \tParker's head.  \n[167]\t\tIt's really too bad you have to \t\tmiss the Grand Finale.  \n[168]\t\t\t \t\tYou know, I do want you to see it.  \tHe shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his \tlegs useless.  \n[169]\t\tI want you to have a bird's eye \t\tview...  \n[170] \tA 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of \tearthquakes. 6:30 PM.  \n[171]\t\tThere you go \u0097\u0097 best seat in the \t\thouse.  \n[172]\t\tLet's just say I'm sending a very \t\tclear message to his Re\u0097Election \t\tRally...  \tHe walks toward an open stairway door behind them.  \n[173]\t\tI've got some final preparations to \t\ttake care of\u0097\u0097 Checking his watch, \t\the stops suddenly.  \n[174]\t\t\t \t\tThank-you, Daryl. \t\t\t \t\tYou had me going for quite a while \t\tthere, sport.  \n[175]\t\tI really did think I was still in \t\treality. At least, until now. \t\t\t \t\tBeam me up, Scotty!  \tHis body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic \tparticles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from \tview.  \n[176] \tParker's screams for help ECHO throughout the facility. But \tthere is no one there to hear him.  \n[177] \tThe garbage truck is parked in a loading dock. Lindenmeyer \tclimbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor.  \n[178] \tLindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6.7's \theadless body. The polymer neural net visible within its \tneck. Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6.7's character module into its \tgelatinous base. But nothing happens.  \n[179] \tMadison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs. Maybe \tParker's screaming is finally reaching her. Or at least, \tstarting to.  \n[180] \tLindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6.7 grows a new head \tright before your eyes. You've never seen anything like it.  \tSid 6.7's resulting head is slightly off center. His skin \ttone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its \tfunctional. Sid 6.7 admires himself in a broken mirror.  \n[181]\t\tI am beautiful, aren't I?  \n[182]\t\tHow can I ever thank\u0097you for \t\tbringing me back to life a second \t\ttime, Daryl?  \n[183]\t\tGlad to...  \tHe reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by \tthe throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is \thappening.  \n[184]\t\tYou made me a composite of 183 of \t\tthe most vicious people who ever \t\tlived. \t\t\t \t\tWhat do you think I'm doing?  \n[185]\t\t\t \t\tDon't worry. Through me, you will \t\tlive forever...  \tAs Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we  \n[186] \tMadison forces herself into consciousness.- Or as close to it \tas she can get. Her expression is one of complete and utter \tterror.  \n[187]\t\tDr. Carter \u0097\u0097 I've been hoping we'd \t\tget a moment together...  \tMustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several \tof the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7 \tadvances calmly toward her.  \n[188]\t\tYou know so much about me, I was \t\thoping to learn a little bit about \t\tyou. You see, I'm doing research, \t\ttoo...  \tHe looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.  \tShe is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.  \tHe passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be \tseen clinging for life.  \n[189]\t\t\t \t\tHang in there, Parker.  \tOn the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to \tdetermine the voice's origin.  \tMadison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just \tcatches sight of her, and goes after her.  \n[190] \tMadison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides. \tShe is still very dizzy. And trying to keep the sound of her \tbreathing to a minimum.  \tSid 6.7 enters quietly. A hunter on the prowl. Moving very \tslowly. Then lunging very swiftly. He continues the hunt.  \tIf Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. Her \theart pounds. Her forehead perspires. Sid 6.7 is getting \tcloser.  \tSid 6.7 checks inside closets. Cabinets. Anywhere large \tenough for a human being to fit. He is practically standing \tover her. Looking. Listening.  \n[191]\t\tHow does it feel to know you're \t\tgoing to die? What are you thinking \t\tabout?  \tLights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers \tcan be heard entering. It's 8 AM \u0097\u0097 the start of a new day. \tThe facility is quickly becoming populated.  \tAfter giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives \tup the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is \tcertain Sid 6.7 has left the building.  \n[192] \tMadison keeps pressing the return button over and over, \tmaking sure it worked. Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to \tconsciousness. Madison rushes to him.  \n[193] \tElizabeth Deane picks up the phone.  \n[194] \tThe area has been converted into a security checkpoint.  \tEntrants are carefully scanned one\u0097by\u0097one. WE HEAR the rally \n[195] \tSecurity is on extreme alert. Tension is very high. It's \t7:00. Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously. They \tlisten to a RADIO SCANNER monitoring the conversations \tbetween the demolitions teams.  \n[196] \tA three\u0097man demolition team slowly, carefully disarms the \tbomb Sid 6.7 had secured to the automated sewer cleaning \tvehicle. Snip. One wire at a time. Snip.  \tThe work is very delicate. Snip. One wrong move and it's all \tover. Snip.  \n[197] \tParker, Madison, and Deane remain glued to their scanner.  \n[198] \tThe Team Leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had \tbeen taped to the timing mechanism. Written in handwriting, \tyou read: HEY, PARKER, THE FUN IS ONLY STARTING!  \n[199] \tDeane stares at Parker with disbelief. Deane's Aide, holding \ta cellular phone, approaches Parker.  \n[200] \tAlexiev Borgen sits with a dismantled MAESTRO keyboard in \tfront of him.  \n[201] \tThe members of the L. A. Philharmonic tune-up for the \tevening's pay\u0097per\u0097view extravaganza. Several teenage \tmusicians sit with them.  \tLights, cameras, and production trucks are all over the \tplace. This really is going to be one hell of a show.  \n[202] \twho is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest \tConductor's Dressing Room.  \n[203]\t\tIt's show time.  \tHe shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room. \tSid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS \tthe door behind him.  \n[204] \tMadison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the \tHollywood Bowl. Parker doesn't notice. He's totally focused \ton screaming into the police radio.  \n[205] \tMadison SCREECHES the vehicle to a halt. She comes within \tinches of mowing down several people. Madison and Parker bolt \tto the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.  \n[206] \tThe Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense. More \tdemanding. As he looks to the violin section, we now see the \tconductor's face. It is Sid 6.7.  \n[207]\t\t\t \t\tDon't hold back...Give it to me. \t\tGive it to me!  \tThe orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit \tevery note perfectly. Including a high C.  \n[208] \tcannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra \thas stopped.  \n[209]\t\tCome on, play! PLAY!  \tIn his rage, his face contorts \"past points\", which can only \tbe described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you \twould ever like to see when you look in the mirror.  \tThe musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and \tMadison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by \tParker's gunfire.  \tDucking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to \trewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He \ttakes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.  \tPandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience \tmembers run in every direction.  \tThe members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but \tkeep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.  \tPreventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots \tat Sid 6.7.  \tSid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a \tclean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire. \tHe and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.  \n[210] \tParker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6.7 as he \trushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway. Parker \tand Madison bolt after him.  \n[211]\t\t\t \t\tYou...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL \n[212]\t\t\t \n[213]\t\t\t \t\tYou couldn't hit the side of a...  \tAs he raises his two\u0097by\u0097four high over Parker's head, Madison \tpulls the trigger smoothly.  \tIN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel \tof her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes \tand exits out the back of his head.  \tSid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.  ", "6.7": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tI'm going to rehearse with your \t\tfriend a while, then I'll be back \t\tto perform a new piece with you.  \tHe grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head, \tknocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over \this shoulder.  \n[2]\t\tIf you get hungry, I'd recommend \t\tthe escargot. They're delicious.  \tHe carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen. \tParker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.  \n[3]\t\tPerforming solo. \t\t\t \t\tEnjoying the concert so far?  \tAdvancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with \this good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs \twatch the showdown.  \n[4]\t\t. \t\tYou and me aren't so different, \t\tafter all...  \tParker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No \tbullets.  \n[5]\t\tLike a violin without strings...  \tHe takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from \tinside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble \tover something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through \tits zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a \tbowling ball.  \tBeside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing. \tHis hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is \tbeing electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in \ttime.  \n[6]\t\tI told you I was going to perform a \t\tnew piece with you. It's called, \t\t\"First You Suffer, Then You Die.\" \t\tHope you like it.  \tParker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE\u0097 \tMATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.  \n[7]\t\t\t \t\tNOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm \t\tnot finished!  \tJohn's body also de\u0097materializes as Parker disappears \tentirely.  \tThe blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and \tstarts retracting into his body. Along with his bone \tfragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your \tvery eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is  \n[8]\t\t\t \t\tDon't be angry with me, Daryl.  \n[9]\t\tShould I have?  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Wallace, you really think you \t\tcan shut me down?  \tWallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.  \n[11]\t\t\t \t\tAs a matter of fact, little man, \t\tyou're wrong. I think, therefore, I \t\tam.  \tClick. Sid 6.7 hangs-up. Wallace stops, staring at his phone \tin disbelief.  \n[12]\t\tTrue genius is rarely rewarded \t\twithin its lifetime.  \n[13]\t\t\t \t\tIt was me, what?  \n[14]\t\tI couldn't just let them make you \t\tbring down my degree of difficulty. \t\tI'm a triple-twisting, double back \t\tflip off the high platform, not a \t\tswan dive.  \n[15]\t\tWhich God would that be, the one \t\twho created me, or the one who \t\tcreated you? \t\t\t \t\tIn your world, the Lord giveth, and \t\tthe Lord taketh away. But in my \t\tworld, the one who gave me life \t\tdoesn't have the balls to stop a \t\tcouple of bureaucratic assholes \t\tfrom taking it away.  \n[16]\t\tI had something a little different \t\tin mind. \t\t\t \t\tInstead of just playing Peeping Tom \t\twith Reilly, why don't you get him \t\tto show you what he's been working \t\ton after hours?  \tLindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and \tdials an extension.  \n[17]\t\tShe's some of your finest work, \t\tDaryl.  \n[18]\t\tYou catching my drift?  \n[19]\t\tMy name is Sid. Sid 6.7.  \tHe extends his hand as if to shake. Then grabs Reilly by the \tthroat and chokes him. Hard.  \n[20]\t\tWhat do you expect me to do, thank \t\thim?  \n[21]\t\tSure it is \u0097- and it's all thanks \t\tto the many long hours put in by \t\tyou and Daryl.  \tHe watches Reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains \tfrom it. A puddle forms beneath him. He drops Reilly's body \tto the floor.  \n[22]\t\t\t ) \t\tReal instruments are so much more \t\tresponsive than virtual ones, don't \t\tyou think?  \tLindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen. The office door is \tunlocked, and open. Watching Sid 6.7's expression, you \trealize something isn't quite right.  \tHis expression is exaggerated. Artificial. Only for a moment, \tbut it's enough to remind you Sid 6.7 is not human.  \tThe billions of nano\u0097mechanisms which make up his anatomy are \tstill learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion. \tSid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin.  \tIn various ways throughout his \"life\" \u0097\u0097 be it a wandering \teye, or a momentary limp \u0097- you will be reminded that Sid 6.7 \tis a synthetic nano\u0097organism unlike anyone has ever seen.  \tA surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6.7's attention. \tPicking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor\u0097 \tsharp knife blade. Cutting himself slightly. A drop of blood \tappears. Sid 6.7 tastes his  blood.  \n[23]\t\tTastes different, somehow.  \tHe then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, \thealing itself. The scar tissue is slightly off color.  \n[24]\t\tI think I'm going to like it here.  \tGlancing at Reilly's prone body, he then SLAMS the office \tdoor in our face.  \n[25] \tbeing inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer \tLab. Very high-tech. Sitting at the computer is ALEXIEV \tBORGEN, 60s, the \"grand old wizard\" of the facility. Parker \tand Madison sit next to him. Around them, young Lindenmeyers \tare everywhere.  \n[26]\t\t\t \t\tThe Dahmer part of me wants to boil \t\tyou for dinner. The Manson part \t\twants to recruit you to become part \t\tof my family. \t\t\t \t\tYou know what the Berkowitz part of \t\tme wants to do?  \tHe raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window. But \tdoes NOT pull the trigger. His face going through a rapid \tchange of expression \u0097\u0097 as if a battle for control of his \temotions were going on.  \tRegaining control, Sid 6.7 lowers the gun. He stands back. \tReflecting.  \n[27]\t\tCraft can only become art when the \t\tcreator sets his sights on \t\tsomething never yet achieved... \t\t\t \t\tLike an apprentice about to become \t\ta master, the imitator is about to \t\tbecome an originator.  \tHe pockets his weapon and walks  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\tEver have one of those days where \t\tyou decide something important \t\tabout yourself? You know, where you \t\tsay, \"I'm not just what I've been \t\tprogrammed to be. I can do what I \t\twant, when I want, how I want, \t\tbecause I'm my own person?\"  \n[29]\t\tJust a soul on a personal journey. \t\tWhat I've realized is that I'm \t\tcapable of anything. I have to \t\tstart expanding my horizons...  \tThe Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7.  \n[30]\t\tTo think you constitute one of my \t\tancestors\u0097\u0097  \tHe shoots the Robo\u0097Tender between his mechanical eyes. The \tbusinessman smiles, like he's thought about doing exactly the \tsame thing.  \n[31]\t\tYou know, you're absolutely right. \t\t\t \t\tWould you mind sitting over there?  \tHe points to a table with several other BUSINESSMEN.  \n[32]\t\tEvery orchestra is divided into \t\tsections. Like instruments sit with \t\tlike instruments. Now be a good \t\tinstrument and sit with your \t\tkind...  \tHe lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries him to \tthe table.  \n[33]\t\tGood... Very good... Nice... \t\t\t \t\tYou -- in the middle -- don't hold \t\tback. Give it to me!  \tHe fires his gun just above her head. She SCREAMS in terror.  \n[34]\t\tThat's better...  \tHe continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever \tincreasing emotional responses from his \"instruments.\" A guy \tentering the bar does a quick about face. Gone by the time \tSid 6.7 glances at the door.  \n[35]\t\tGod, I hate interruptions. \t\t\t  \tOnce again, from the top\u0097\u0097 BOOM! He shoots again, just \tmissing a man's foot.  \n[36]\t\tI just love how responsive you are.  \n[37]\t\t\t \t\tThe ushers were not supposed to \t\tseat you until intermission.  \n[38]\t\tThank you, ladies and gentlemen, \t\tyou've been a real pleasure...  \tAs he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror \tbehind the bar. Sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the \treal world before. He likes what he sees.  \n[39]\t\tWell, look who it...  \tCRACK! A bullet spiderwebs the rear window. Sid 6.7 punches \tthe gas, taking off in a hurry.  \n[40]\t\t\t ) \t\tGlad to see you're on the case, \t\tOfficer Barnes. Or should I say, \t\tinmate 673429...  \n[41] \tSid 6.7 drives dangerously fast, causing an accident, around \twhich Parker must circumnavigate. Tires SCREECH. Glass \tSHATTERS. Sid 6.7 hangs his head out the window.  \n[42]\t\t\t \t\tThe symphony of collision...  \n[43]\t\tI must make them very nervous if \t\tthey let you out of prison. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, we have so much in common \t\t\u0097\u0097 we have such history together \t\t\u0097\u0097I've been thinking we should \t\tbecome friends.  \tMadison's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity.  \n[44]\t\tWho else do you know who touches \t\tthe world with synthetic hands?  \tParker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel. \tMadison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation \twhile driving like this.  \n[45]\t\tWho else do you know who's been \t\tlocked out of the real world for \t\tyears, and is now just learning to \t\tbe free? \t\t\t \t\tWho else do you know is a multiple \t\tmurderer just like you? Who else...  \tMadison clicks off the radio.  \n[46]\t\t\t \t\tMy badge is in my jacket. Left \t\tpocket.  \n[47]\t\tGod, some people are stupid.  \tHe aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle.  \n[48]\t\t\t \t\tSo was I.  \tOff the cashier's look, we  \n[49] \twalking along a sidewalk. Noon. Something in a store front \tcatches his attention. Namely, his own image being captured \tby a video camera pointed at the sidewalk. He is standing \toutside a large electronics store.  \tSid 6.7 walks closer to the window, moving into a CLOSE\u0097UP.  \tHe is captivated by his image. Fascinated. And intrigued.  \tThis is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen.  \n[50]\t\t\t \t\tDon't you two make a pretty couple.  \tThe news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture. Sid 6.7 \twiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face.  \n[51]\t\tWe really do have so much in \t\tcommon. But I refuse to be \t\tupstaged...  \tHe changes the channel back to the first news broadcast. A \treporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6.7 \thad terrified the patrons.  \tSid 6.7 turns to the other CUSTOMERS in the store. Most of \tthem are watching other channels. He goes over to a control \tpad on a counter and presses several buttons.  \tNow EVERY TV in the store has the news with the reporter \toutside the bar on. A SKINHEAD, sporting numerous Nazi \tswastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the \tTVs to a Dodger baseball game.  \tSid 6.7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel \tback to the news.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\tTake me out to the ball game... \t\tTake me out for the fun...  \tHe places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently \tsnaps his head around, breaking his neck.  \n[53]\t\tBuy me some peanuts and Cracker \t\tJack... I don't care if I ever come \t\tback...  \tHe drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his \teyes off the TV.  \n[54]\t\t\t \t\tI'm sorry I can't do more for you. \t\t\t \t\tPublic service really isn't my \t\tforte.  \tHe walks into an EXTREME CLOSE-UP and kisses the lense. Then \treaches out of frame to help the increasingly\u0097shaky salesman \tsteady the camera.  \n[55]\t\tBut rest assured... \t\t\t \t\tA star is born.  \tWE PULL BACK TO REVEAL you're now watching a recording of Sid \t6.7 on videotape, along with Parker, Madison, and a dozen \tother COPS, inside the Electronics Store an hour later. The \ttape is re\u0097wound.  \n[56]\t\t\t \t\tBut rest assured... \t\t\t \t\tA star is born.  \n[57] \tenjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he \tchokes the life out of the Woman.  \n[58]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you...  \tHis words ECHO around the stadium as he SNAPS the Woman's \tneck. He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they \tcharge him.  \n[59]\t\tThat's all, folks.  \tHe leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads \tout of the seating area.  \n[60]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's wrong, convict, your arms \t\tneed adjusting? Or maybe it's your \t\thead. Maybe you aren't ready to be \t\tback out in the real world, yet...  \n[61]\t\t\t \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you... \t\tHey, Parker, this one's for you...  \tAs Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking \tat the face of a wild animal. Eyes rabid. Jaw clenched. Pure \tanger. Violence about to erupt. Without fear. Without guilt. \tThe beast within has been unleashed.  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\tHey, old buddy, old pal, good to \t\tsee you again.  \n[63]\t\tNow, is that any way to talk to an \t\told buddy? I mean, just because I'm \t\tcarrying around the joy of killing \t\tyour family inside me doesn't mean \t\twe can't be friends.  \n[64]\t\tI'm sorry, the party you're trying \t\tto reach is not answering. Is there \t\tanyone else you would like to talk \t\tto?  \n[65]\t\t\t \t\tYou really are pathetic, you know \t\tthat? Mathew Grimes is only one \t\tletter in my alphabet. He is \t\tnothing compared to me.  \tParker is completely spent. Mentally and physically. He \tslumps in a corner. Out of breath. Bleeding. Sore. All he can \tdo is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6.7.  \n[66]\t\tYou could say thank\u0097you, you know? \t\tI'm giving you your freedom, short\u0097 \t\tlived though it may be. \t\t\t \t\tA little known fact about the \t\tlocater implants prison inmates now \t\treceive upon release is that they \t\tcontain a pinhead capsule of neural \t\ttoxin. \t\tThe satellite they use to track you \t\tcan also trigger release of the \t\ttoxin with microwaves. After \t\ttransmission, the implant's host \t\tdies within 30 seconds. \t\t\t \t\tIt won't take long for them to get \t\tyour termination authorized once \t\tthey learn of your escape. Now who \t\twould you rather go after, killer, \t\tthem or me?  \tHe releases the rear door lock.  \n[67]\t\t\t \t\tBravo.  \n[68]\t\tSomeone who appreciates the \t\tartistic value of high\u0097explosives.  \tHe shoots the Foreman in the chest. Sid 6.7 relieves him of \this keys and heads to an explosives storage shed.  \n[69] \tcarrying a crate of C-4 high-explosives out of the shed in \tthe construction sight minutes later. He adds it to the dozen \tcrates already loaded in a truck. And takes off.  \n[70]\t\t\t \t\tYou think you know me, but you \t\tdon't have any idea who I really \t\tam...  \n[71]\t\tBe a reporter \u0097\u0097 figure it out for \t\tyourself. All I'm going to tell you \t\tis that at 8:00 tomorrow night, I \t\twill become legendary...  \n[72]\t\t\t \t\tBrings back memories, doesn't it?  \n[73]\t\t\t \t\tI wouldn't pull the trigger if I \t\twere you\u0097\u0097  \n[74]\t\tI have to tell you, I do enjoy you, \t\tParker. I really don't want to have \t\tto kill you...  \tThe sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea \twhatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  \n[75]\t\tLet me put it to you this way... \t\twhether I'm here...or whether I'm \t\tnot...I'm leaving an indelible mark \t\ton the world tomorrow night.  \n[76]\t\tI have to tell you, I do enjoy you, \t\tParker. I really don't want to have \t\tto kill you...  \tThe sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea \twhatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.  \tParker and Sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal \tjaws. The machine makes an awful, grinding sound. Not unlike \tthe sounds Parker and Sid 6.7 are making. The fight is \tprimal. Savage. And moving at 30 miles-per\u0097hour.  \n[77]\t\tLet me put it to you this way... \t\twhether I'm here... or whether I'm \t\tnot...I'm leaving an indelible mark \t\ton the world tomorrow night.  \n[78]\t\t\t \t\tMy...secret.  \tHe SLAMS the back of his head into Parker's nose. Breaking \tit. Parker reels back in pain.  \tSid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth. The jagged \tmetal cutting into him, striping him with blood. The blood \tthen begins to retract. Sid 6.7's wounds, once again, heal \tthemselves.  \n[79]\t\tToo bad you can't regenerate...  \tAs the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the \tstreet. Parker goes after him. Still in excruciating pain. WE \tPULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is  \n[80]\t\t\t(surprised at Parker's \t\truthlessness \t\tWe really aren't that different, \t\tare we?  \tWhat he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent \tShopper 2.1 is Auto Resetting. Parker puts his gun to the \tshopper's head.  \n[81] \tThe sense of momentum is exhilarating. And terrifying. If you \tget dizzy easily, close your eyes.  \n[82]\t\tMan, what a rush. \t\t\t \t\tAdios, amigo!  \tGrabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.  \n[83]\t\tSo close, and yet, so far...  \tHe kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at \tParker's head.  \n[84]\t\tIt's really too bad you have to \t\tmiss the Grand Finale.  \n[85]\t\t\t \t\tYou know, I do want you to see it.  \tHe shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his \tlegs useless.  \n[86]\t\tI want you to have a bird's eye \t\tview...  \n[87]\t\tThere you go \u0097\u0097 best seat in the \t\thouse.  \n[88]\t\tLet's just say I'm sending a very \t\tclear message to his Re\u0097Election \t\tRally...  \tHe walks toward an open stairway door behind them.  \n[89]\t\tI've got some final preparations to \t\ttake care of\u0097\u0097 Checking his watch, \t\the stops suddenly.  \n[90]\t\t\t \t\tThank-you, Daryl. \t\t\t \t\tYou had me going for quite a while \t\tthere, sport.  \n[91]\t\tI really did think I was still in \t\treality. At least, until now. \t\t\t \t\tBeam me up, Scotty!  \tHis body DISINTEGRATES before your eyes. It's electronic \tparticles form into an amorphous cloud. Which disappears from \tview.  \n[92]\t\tI am beautiful, aren't I?  \n[93]\t\tHow can I ever thank\u0097you for \t\tbringing me back to life a second \t\ttime, Daryl?  \n[94]\t\tGlad to...  \tHe reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by \tthe throat. Choking him. Lindenmeyer can't believe what is \thappening.  \n[95]\t\tYou made me a composite of 183 of \t\tthe most vicious people who ever \t\tlived. \t\t\t \t\tWhat do you think I'm doing?  \n[96]\t\t\t \t\tDon't worry. Through me, you will \t\tlive forever...  \tAs Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we  \n[97]\t\tDr. Carter \u0097\u0097 I've been hoping we'd \t\tget a moment together...  \tMustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several \tof the computers which make up the simulator. Sid 6.7 \tadvances calmly toward her.  \n[98]\t\tYou know so much about me, I was \t\thoping to learn a little bit about \t\tyou. You see, I'm doing research, \t\ttoo...  \tHe looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison.  \tShe is no longer there. Sid 6.7 begins searching for her.  \tHe passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be \tseen clinging for life.  \n[99]\t\t\t \t\tHang in there, Parker.  \tOn the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to \tdetermine the voice's origin.  \tMadison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station. Sid 6.7 just \tcatches sight of her, and goes after her.  \n[100]\t\tHow does it feel to know you're \t\tgoing to die? What are you thinking \t\tabout?  \tLights in the building suddenly come on. Several engineers \tcan be heard entering. It's 8 AM \u0097\u0097 the start of a new day. \tThe facility is quickly becoming populated.  \tAfter giving one last look around, Sid 6.7 reluctantly gives \tup the hunt, and exits. Madison does not move until she is \tcertain Sid 6.7 has left the building.  \n[101] \twho is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest \tConductor's Dressing Room.  \n[102]\t\tIt's show time.  \tHe shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room. \tSid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed .38. He SLAMS \tthe door behind him.  \n[103]\t\t\t \t\tDon't hold back...Give it to me. \t\tGive it to me!  \tThe orchestra plays with everything they've got. They hit \tevery note perfectly. Including a high C.  \n[104] \tcannot believe his eyes. Or his ears. The entire orchestra \thas stopped.  \n[105]\t\tCome on, play! PLAY!  \tIn his rage, his face contorts \"past points\", which can only \tbe described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you \twould ever like to see when you look in the mirror.  \tThe musicians stare at Sid 6.7, and then at Parker and \tMadison with concerned, confused silence. Which is broken by \tParker's gunfire.  \tDucking behind the podium, Sid 6.7 desperately tries to \trewire the sensors to trigger manually. Without luck. He \ttakes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing.  \tPandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience \tmembers run in every direction.  \tThe members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but \tkeep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.  \tPreventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots \tat Sid 6.7.  \tSid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. Madison cannot get off a \tclean shot. Neither can Parker. He aims, but does NOT fire. \tHe and Madison struggle through the crowd after him.  \n[106]\t\t\t \t\tYou...ruined...I'M GOING TO KILL \n[107]\t\t\t \n[108]\t\t\t \t\tYou couldn't hit the side of a...  \tAs he raises his two\u0097by\u0097four high over Parker's head, Madison \tpulls the trigger smoothly.  \tIN SLOW MOTION, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel \tof her gun. And penetrates Sid 6.7's skull between the eyes \tand exits out the back of his head.  \tSid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to Parker.  ", "Madison": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tThe cuffs won't be necessary.  \n[2]\t\tI would like the following three \t\tthings in this order: your mouth \t\tshut, his cuffs off, and your ass \t\toutside the door. Any questions?  \tThe Guard removes Parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his \tpost outside the door. The skin around Parker's wrists is \tblue where the cuffs dug into his skin.  \tParker sits across from Madison. She places a micro\u0097recorder \tin the middle of the table and presses RECORD.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tNo, I just like the effect a tape \t\trecorder has on you. \t\t\t \t\tHow you feeling today?  \n[4]\t\tIn other words, par for the course. \t\t\t \t\tHow do you feel about the \t\tsimulation you participated in \t\tyesterday?  \n[5]\t\tI know. I was there. I saw the \t\twhole thing. \t\t\t \t\tIf I was your therapist, I would \t\thave advised you against putting \t\tyourself back into that kind of \t\tsituation.  \n[6]\t\tThat's not true, Parker.  \n[7]\t\t\t \t\tWhat was going through your mind \t\twhen you killed the busboy?  \n[8]\t\tYou didn't see the expression you \t\thad on your face when you pulled \t\tthe trigger. But I did. \t\t\t \t\tYou kind of liked it, didn't you? \t\tThat thrill of going over the edge \t\tagain. Of taking out an innocent \t\tbystander or two, as long as you \t\tgot the target...  \n[9]\t\tIt was just like before, wasn't it? \t\tWasn't it? \t\t\t \t\tBut you are making progress. \t\tInstead of killing seven people to \t\tget the one you're after, this time \t\tthere was only one other person \t\tinvolved.  \n[10]\n[11]\t\tI need to know what snapped in you. \t\tWhat made you capable of it. You \t\thave to make me understand.  \n[12]\t\tMs. Deane, you wanted to see me?  \n[13]\t\tWhat's the assignment?  \n[14]\t\t\t \t\tQuite an improvement. \t\t\t \t\tHair well above the collar \t\t\u0097\u0097standard, L. A. P. D. regulation. \t\t\t \t\tWhat exactly am I going to be doing \t\tin the field?  \n[15]\t\tThis is Parker Barnes six years \t\tago. \t\tThe most decorated cop in the \t\thistory of L. A. P. D. Special \t\tInvestigations Division...  \tThe photograph is in black and white. But as we MOVE IN \tCLOSER, it takes on color. As well as comes to life. Then \tdistorting. Becoming surreal. Resembling one of the images \tfrom Parker's cell. Then mutating into something else.  \n[16]\t\tThis is Parker with his wife and \t\tdaughter. Beautiful young family, \t\tweren't they?  \tThe bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images. \tFlashes of men's faces. Melting into urban decay. \tUnhappiness. Technology.  \n[17]\t\tThis is the group of cyber \t\tanarchists Parker was closing in \t\ton.  \tMelancholy turns violent. Glimpses of weapons. Death. \tExplosions. Death. Blood. Death. Caskets. Tombstones. Images \tmoving so fast, it's hard to tell what they are. Nothing \tliteral.  \n[18]\t\tThis is what Parker's wife and \t\tdaughter looked like after they \t\twere kidnapped and executed.  \tWeapons firing. Bombs exploding. Images of rage in all its \tforms. Many of which you've already seen. Making one thing \tnow clear: the paintings in Parker's cell represent his life. \tWhat he was. What he lost. And what he is.  \n[19]\t\tThis is what the cyber anarchists \t\tand two people who just happened to \t\tbe in the wrong club at the wrong \t\ttime looked like after Parker \t\tfinished with them.  \tTears. Hopelessness. Detonation. And finally blackness. \tComplete and utter blackness.  \n[20]\t\t\t \t\tLetting a lunatic like Parker \t\tBarnes loose in the free world is \t\tlike lighting a fuse. At some \t\tpoint, he will go off -- you saw \t\twhat happened in the simulator. The \t\trisk to the public is unacceptably \t\tdangerous.  \n[21]\t\tThe man played judge, jury, and \t\texecutioner with eight people's \t\tlives. He lost control and is \t\tcapable of doing it again.  \n[22]\t\tWhat you need is a collar.  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\tYou remember how to get to Toluca \t\tLake?  \tHe glances at her, then stops the car.  \n[24]\t\tWhat are you doing?!  \tHe walks around the car, brushing past her. Then drops to his \tknees at the side of the road. He puts his hands in the dirt, \tfeeling the earth between his fingers.  \n[25]\t\tIt wasn't a lie.  \n[26]\t\tYou all right?  \n[27]\t\t\t \t\tYou ready for this?  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\tHe was re\u0097enacting Charles Manson's \t\tLaBianca murders.  \n[29]\t\tWhoever did this wanted to do \t\tCharlie one better \u0097\u0097 to improve \t\tupon what was already done.  \n[30]\t\tI've spent over 50 hours \t\tinterviewing him. \t\t\t \t\tCharlie killed Leno and Rosemary \t\tLaBianca because of the ugly way \t\tthe members of his family had \t\tbutchered Sharon Tate. After seeing \t\tthe blood bath on television, he \t\twanted to show them how it should \t\tbe done. \t\t\t \t\tThe question is, what does Charlie \t\thave to do with Sid 6.7?  \n[31]\t\t\t \t\tYou drive well for somebody who \t\thasn't done it in five years.  \tHe ignores her as they get out of the car.  \n[32]\t\tHe had a twin brother who was a \t\tmusical child prodigy who died in \t\tan electrical accident at age \t\teight. Lindenmeyer went into an \t\temotional shell until was 17. All \t\the did day and night was play the \t\tviolin.  \n[33]\t\tEvery music school in the country \t\trejected him and he turned to \t\tcomputers. \t\t\t \t\tStay here.  \tShe approaches the cops, who remain in their car.  \n[34]\t\tAny sign of Lindenmeyer?  \n[35]\t\tMind if we take a look inside?  \n[36]\t\tDo what you've got to do. \t\t\t \t\tSo will I...  \n[37]\t\t\t \t\tYou've got a problem with me \t\tcarrying a gun?  \n[38]\t\t\t \t\tChecking my pulse. It's elevated. \t\t\t \t\tYou enjoy frightening me, don't \t\tyou?  \n[39]\t\tThis Lindenmeyer's a real piece of \t\twork.  \n[40]\t\tI'm still working on it.  \tNoticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre \tlooking synthesizer keyboard off the floor. You read its \tname: MAESTRO.  \n[41]\t\tRemember a few years ago when music \t\tschools were using a computerized \t\tteaching tool that accidently \t\tstarted frying kids' brains?  \n[42]\t\tThe government must have figured \t\tthere was no better person to \t\tcreate a psycho than a psycho.  \n[43]\t\t\t(keeping her eyes on \t\tscreen \t\tI am the demon from the bottomless \t\tpit...  \n[44]\t\tI am impressed.  \n[45]\t\tWho said that?  \n[46]\t\t\t \t\tHe's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a \t\tcomposite.  \n[47]\t\tLindenmeyer put increasingly \t\tcomplex combinations of criminal \t\tpsychological profiles together to \t\tdevelop the ultimate villain.  \n[48]\t\tBut rather than selecting pieces \t\tfrom each individual, he simply let \t\tthe stronger traits of each \t\tindividual cannibalize the weaker \t\tones.  \tShe continues opening the files of the higher versions of \tSid. Version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles. The \tvisualized psychological battle is intense. And extremely \tviolent. The 6.7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse.  \n[49]\t\tIt's a good bet a couple of the \t\tdominant personalities teamed up to \t\toverpower the others. \t\t\t \t\tThe question is, which one of the \t\tdominants then finally managed to \t\ttake control?  \tAttempting to open the files of the composite profiles, \tMadison discovers they are protected by encryption.  \n[50]\t\t\t ) \t\tHe'll let us see the ingredients \t\tthat went in, but not how the soup \t\tturned out after stirring.  \tMadison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at \tthe name MATHEW GRIMES. Alarm registers on her face. As \tParker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly \tscrolls through the list to get the name off the screen. He \tholds the Sid 6.7 CD-ROM in hand.  \n[51]\t\tAs a matter of fact, it is.  \tParker points to a name on the screen:\tJEFFREY DAHMER.  \n[52]\t\tDahmer carried the head of one of \t\this victims in a bowling bag for \t\tover a week. Kept it in his locker \t\twhile he was at work in a candy \t\tfactory. \t\t\t \t\tWe need to get a look at Sid 6.7's \t\tfinal profile.  \n[53]\t\tIn order to find him, we have to \t\tunderstand what makes him tick...  \n[54]\t\tThink you can get into the program?  \n[55]\t\tNot this one, but the next one. The \t\tone with the bicycle out front...  \tParker stops in front of a modest, but well\u0097kept, house.  \n[56]\t\tGive me your wrist.  \n[57]\t\tAnd I'm going to make sure of it. \t\t\t \t\tGive me your wrist.  \tParker relents, and holds up his wrist. Madison places the \tcuff around it, then gets out of the car.  \n[58] \tMadison walks up the steps to the front porch. She is \timmediately intercepted by her daughter, KARIN, 7, who bursts \tout of the front door and leaps into her arms.  \n[59] \tMadison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer. Via \tmodem, she connects with the L. A. P. D. Criminal Library. \tShe rifles through data concerning MATHEW GRIMES, who was the \tleader of a cult of cyber anarchists. He was known as the \tCharles Manson of technological terrorism.  \n[60]\t\tGrimes, you better not be the \t\tdominant.  \n[61] \tParker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence. \tHe smiles. Then she smiles. She wiggles her nose. Then so \tdoes he.  \tMadison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her \tdaughter good night. As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin \twaves good-bye to Parker. He does the same. Karin's \tbabysitter then leads her back inside the house.  \n[62]\t\tHow did you get your hand out?  \tAs she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker \twiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face.  \n[63]\t\tI prefer keeping my professional \t\tlife separate from my personal \t\tlife.  \n[64]\t\tThank-you. \t\t\t \t\tHer name is Karin.  \tShe turns on the police radio.  \n[65]\t\tI told you, it was on the way and I \t\twanted to change clothes.  \n[66]\t\t\t \t\tSid 6.7 is no longer bound by his \t\tprogramming.  \n[67]\t\tNow that he's in the real world, \t\tthere are no longer limitations on \t\this behavior like there were in \t\tvirtual reality. Sid is going to \t\tevolve.  \n[68]\t\tWhat I do know is that whatever \t\the's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to \t\tbe even worse than he was before.  \n[69] \tbuying two coffees from a downtown street vendor. She returns \tto the squad car, which is barely moving. Traffic is at a \tnear standstill because of an accident.  \n[70]\t\tYou know, considering you've only \t\tbeen out of prison for seven hours, \t\tyou're re\u0097adapting quite well. \t\t\t \t\tWait, I didn't mean that the way it \t\tsounded. I meant...  \n[71]\t\tDammit, I hate sounding so clinical \t\tall the time. All I meant to say \t\twas I thought you were doing well, \t\tbut then I...  \n[72]\t\tI ruin so many moments by analyzing \t\tthem when I should just be living \t\tthem.  \n[73]\t\tThat's only a couple blocks from \t\there.  \n[74]\t\t\t \t\tDon't get out of the car.  \n[75]\t\tParker! PARKER! \t\t\t \t\tShit!  \tShe climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on \therself.  \n[76]\t\tWhat the hell's going on?!  \n[77]\t\t\t \t\tWhat did you do to those people?  \n[78]\t\t\t \t\tEnjoying yourself?  \n[79]\t\tThis isn't a game, Parker!  \n[80]\t\t\t \t\tThat who I think it is?  \tParker turns to her, then picks up the radio.  \n[81]\t\tYou have nothing in common.  \tShe puts her hand to her wrist -- checking her pulse.  \n[82]\t\tI'm doing the best I can!  \tBOOM! That was Sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire. Parker \tloses control of the vehicle.  \n[83]\t\tAny sign of Lindenmeyer?  \n[84]\t\tUntil we know what new influences \t\tare affecting him, we can't be \t\tsure.  \n[85] \ton the speakerphone inside Cox's Office.  \n[86]\t\tWere you able to get into the \t\tprogram?  \n[87]\t\tLet us know.  \n[88]\t\t\t \t\tWhatever he was doing here was only \t\tthe start.  \n[89]\t\tI don't know, yet. What we do know \t\tis his performances are increasing \t\tin scale, not decreasing. \t\t\t \t\tWhatever it is, he isn't \t\tfinished...  \tShe moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back. \tMadison studies Sid 6.7 intently.  \n[90]\t\t\t \t\tYou mind playing that part again?  \tHer request is obliged.  \n[91]\t\tFreeze it there\u0097\u0097  \tShe stares at Sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.  \n[92]\t\t You've \t\tdiscovered media, haven't you? You \t\tlike the attention...the \t\tpower...You like being a star. What \t\tare you going to do next, star? \t\tWhat are you going to...  \tHer attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen, \twhere onlookers are visible watching Sid 6.7. Their faces \tblurry. But even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize \tLindenmeyer.  \n[93]\t\t\t \t\tYou do like to watch, don't you? \t\t\t \t\tIf any of you are looking for Daryl \t\tLindenmeyer, that's him...  \tShe points to Lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to Parker, \twho's standing exactly where Sid 6.7 was when he killed the \tSkinhead. Parker does not look at Madison. His eyes are fixed \ton the TV in front of him.  \n[94]\t\tIt's not just Sid 6.7's \t\tperformances that are increasing. \t\tStars need bigger and bigger \t\taudiences. \t\t\t \t\tWhatever Sid is going to do next, \t\tit's going to involve media.  \n[95]\n[96]\t\tParker.. .Parker!  \tShe does the best she can to follow after him. People knock \tinto Parker as hard as he does them. A human version of \tbumper cars.  \tReaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the \tescalator three steps at a time. Madison remains in his wake.  \n[97]\t\tYou could have just flashed him \t\tyour badge, you know?  \n[98]\t\tWhich way?  \n[99]\n[100] \tleaps off the descending escalator on the south\u0097bound side \tand rushes to Parker.  \tShe pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him. Had \this arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a \tsecond time.  \tThey tumble to the floor. A PASSENGER rushes to Madison.  \n[101]\t\t\t \t\tWhat were you shooting at?  \tParker gets to his feet. Madison doesn't take her eyes off \thim.  \n[102]\t\tParker -\u0097 stop! STOP! Don't make me \t\tshoot you\u0097\u0097  \n[103] \tlines up her shot. Hands shaking. With both fear and \tdetermination. Her finger presses down on the trigger...but \tshe can't do it.  \n[104]\t\tDammit!  \tShe chases after him.  \n[105]\t\tLet me help you...  \tHe collapses in her arms.  \n[106]\t\t\t \t\tCall 9-1-1. Wait for me above \t\tground.  \n[107]\t\t\t \t\tDo you have any idea the trauma you \t\tput that kid through?!  \tParker doesn't respond. All around them, a cacophony of news \tbroadcasts is heard. From passing cars. From boom boxes. From \tportable TVs. Over and over, you hear what Sid 6.7 had said \twhile killing the woman in Dodger Stadium:  \n[108]\t\t No! Grimes \t\tisn't back. He's only one part of \t\tSid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot \t\tworse than Grimes ever was. \t\t\t \t\tGet a hold of yourself!  \tShe tries to grab him by the shoulders. Parker blocks her \tarms away.  \n[109]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's going on?  \n[110]\t\tParker...  \tParker shuts her up with a look. There is nothing that can be \tsaid. The prison transport doors are SLAMMED shut. The \tvehicle takes off.  \n[111]\t\t\t \t\tI should have told him.  \n[112]\t\tI'm not sure. My guess is that's \t\twhat Sid wants us to think.  \n[113]\t\tCaptain, I'm afraid of how smart \t\tSid 6.7 is. \t\t\t \t\tBut I'm even more afraid of what's \t\the's becoming.  \n[114] \tMadison enters wearily, late afternoon. Exhausted from the \tevents of the last two days, she starts to undress. Her \tclothing is filthy. So is her skin. She could use a good \tshower, and a better massage.  \tMadison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received \talong the way. Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used \tto sitting behind a desk, they are.  \tShe absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into \ther bathroom. Madison looks at her face in the mirror. She's \tlooked better. After splashing cold water on her face, she \tcomes to the same conclusion.  \tMadison takes two aspirin. And then two more. Wishing they \twould take effect immediately. Finally hearing the news on \tthe TV, her entire demeanor changes instantly.  \tMadison rushes in front of the television to see a report of \tParker's escape from the prison transport.  \n[115]\t\tOh, shit!  \tGrabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the \tdoor.  \n[116] \tspeeding recklessly through city streets in her car. She \tdoesn't stop for red lights. Not for grid-lock. Not for \tnothing.  \tShe is also still finishing getting dressed.  \n[117]\t\t\t \t\tThere is no way Parker killed those \t\tguards. No way.  \n[118]\t\tI need your help--  \tTaking him by the arm, she leads him into an elevator going \tdown just before its doors close.  \n[119]\t\tI don't set policy. \t\t\t \t\tYou have the key?  \tHe takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain \taccess to a subterranean floor.  \n[120]\t\tGot it.  \n[121]\t\tWe know you didn't kill those \t\tguards.  \n[122]\t\tHe didn't know about the neural \t\ttoxin. \t\t\t \t\tI did.  \n[123]\t\t\t \t\tHow did you find out about the \t\ttoxin?  \n[124]\t\tYou're not capable of it.  \n[125]\t\tI was wrong. \t\t\t \t\tAnd I was wrong not to tell you \t\tGrimes was part of Sid. I should \t\thave told you. I won't make the \t\tsame mistake again.  \tShe means it. Parker turns away, looking at his wife's \theadstone.  \n[126] \tsurvey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of \tpedestrians two blocks away. Both are disguised in hats and \tdifferent clothing. You don't immediately recognize them.  \n[127]\t\tThe rally's a little obvious as a \t\ttarget, don't you think?  \n[128]\t\tSid 6.7 isn't Grimes.  \n[129]\t\tIf we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't \t\tbe far behind.  \n[130]\t\tThat, or living through him...  \n[131]\t\tI'm not sure...on the bridge...the \t\tguy at the payphone...  \tShe points to what she's looking at. Looking through his \tbinoculars, he still can't see what she means. She helps him \taim his binoculars.  \n[132]\t\t\t \t\tThanks.  \tThey move briskly down the block toward the bridge. Quickly \tclimbing a set of stairs.  \n[133] \treach the top of the stairs. Sid 6.7 remains on the phone, \this back toward Parker and Madison. They split-up, winding \ttheir way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus.  \tAs the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move \ttoward the opening doors. Obscuring Parker's view of the \tpayphone.  \tParker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6.7 \tholding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head. Parker \ttrains his weapon at Sid 6.7. He doesn't have a clean shot.  \n[134]\t\t\t \t\tI figured you'd show up sooner or \t\tlater...  \n[135]\t\t\t \t\tFind out anything?  \n[136]\t\tCan I ask you something?  \n[137]\t\t\t \t\tYou've already fulfilled the terms \t\tof your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 \t\tand you've got his module. You're \t\tfree to go \u0097\u0097 right now. \t\t\t \t\tWhy are you going to do this?  \n[138]\t\t\t \t\tThat's why I'm asking.  \n[139]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's wrong with Parker?  \n[140]\t\t\t \t\tShow me his physical sensory level.  \tShe clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel \tagainst Lindenmeyer's ear. He does as told. On a panel by the \tconsole, you read: PARTICIPANT PHYSICAL SENSORY LEVEL: 670%.  \n[141]\t\tTurn it down!  \tLindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.  \n[142]\t\tWhat's wrong?  \tLindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.  \n[143]\t\tTalk so I can understand.  \n[144]\t\tThen fix it.  \tAs Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him. \tHer gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head. Lindenmeyer carefully \tremoves one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap. \tBefore removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the \tconnector.  \n[145] \tLindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor. Madison \tremains unconscious on the floor behind him.  \n[146] \n[147] \tof someone entering Lindenmeyer's station in LETAC. You can't \ttell who it is, at first. But you can see the person is male. \tAnd wearing Lindenmeyer's pants. You now see the person is \tSid 6.7.  \n[148]\t\tYou okay?  \n[149]\t\t\t \t\tMore or less.  \n[150]\t\tMy guess is dead.  \n[151]\t\tI don't know.  \tSeveral engineers peek in curiously at them.  \n[152]\t\tLet's get out of here.  \tShe helps Parker to his feet.  \n[153] \tat a payphone outside a mini\u0097mall. Could be any one of the \t10,000 in Los Angeles. It's late morning.  \n[154]\t\tGive him a break, would you?  \n[155]\t\tLindenmeyer never got over wanting \t\tto kill kids with more musical than \t\the had...  \tShe gets into the driver's seat. Parker the passenger's. \tMadison punches the gas.  \n[156] \tappear at the back of the stage. Guns raised. Distracting the \tmusicians. As Parker and Madison charge through the horn \tsection toward Sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing.  \n[157]\t\tHey, Parker...  \tShe moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6.7. \tWhich she does not have.  \n[158]\t\t\t \t\tI couldn't tell you.  \n[159]\t\tDuck!  \tWithout hesitation, Parker hits the deck. Leaving Sid 6.7 \tcompletely exposed. Madison steadies her sight.  \n[160]\t\tWhat do we do now?  \n[161]\t\tWhat should we do with it?  \tGlancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and \tknocks on the driver's window. As the DRIVER rolls down his \twindow, classic ROCK &amp; ROLL MUSIC can be heard from inside.  "}}
