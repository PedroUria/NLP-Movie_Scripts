You got a mind for this shit, E. \n[40]What, Cube? Nah, he in a group right now, got some other business goin' on. But I got this group called H.B.O. from the east coast. Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song for `em that's crazy. \n[41]Y'all got somethin' to say about Compton? Cause we might have a problem up in this bitch. \n[42]Then do the lyrics.

Stage was shaking so much-- thought my needles was about to jump off the record! \n[59]That'll work. Priority Records? I'm not familiar with your label. What artist do you got over there? \n[60]Aiight! If your rhymes ain't tight, you ain't makin' the record. So you better have your shit together. Yella Boy -- Rewind that shit! \n[61]I'm expressin' with my full capabilities, And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities... \n[62]Now this is what I'm talkin' about.

I'm out here day and night bustin' my ass, tryin' to create something, and you gonna come up in here talkin' about some bitches? Are you crazy? \n[66]Nah, you don't get it. \n[67]Fuck no.

Any of y'all named Felicia? \n[86]I think her man's outside. And that nigga strapped. \n[87]Nah, I think you over reacting. Eazy's one of us, Cube. What you thinking don't even make sense -- \n[88]Look, I hear that, but I think we should ride this wave. Don't be jumpin' to conclusions until you know for sure, \n[89]We gotta stop. Gotta get somewhere with a phone -- \n[90]Stop the fuckin' bus, man! \n[91]My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother... \n[92]He got into a fight near Leimert Park. A big mothafucka fell on top of him -- broke his neck. He killed Tyree. I can't believe this shit. \n[93]He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened... \n[94]If I brung him out on tour with me, like he wanted -- \n[95]We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got -- \n[96]Damn, they comin' after us, too? \n[97]You just got a snapshot of how Americans honestly feel. \n[98]Isn't it obvious. Real recongnize real. \n[99]You ain't signed? \n[100]Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..? \n[101]Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed. \n[102]Cube, we Ruthless. \n[103]  \n[104]Wuddup, Suge -- You good? \n[105]Fucked up about what? I been bangin' that shit. \n[106]How you figure? That record's still the hottest shit out there. \n[107]  \n[108]Wuddup. \n[109]Goddamn. Is he paralyzed? \n[110]Vocal chords? \n[111]I don't know. \n[112]He aiight. I guess. \n[113]I dunno. I just focus on the music. . Maybe your people could look into my shit too? \n[114]... We started out with too much cargo. So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold. \n[115]Still can't believe it. It's like they're enjoying themselves. \n[116]Yep, we got they asses this time. Tape don't lie. \n[117]What you mean by that? \n[118]Nah. I got this. \n[119]I know you don't like hearin' this shit. But it's about Jerry. We gotta get rid of that muthafuck -- \n[120]I found out some information, Eric. Real shit. I had some people look at this, and I ain't gettin' my fair share. \n[121]Cube was right, fool! You gotta look at these papers, E. Just look and you'll see. \n[122]We made it because our shit is dope, Eric, not because of Jerry. We can keep going and own the goddamn world, we just can't be fuckin' with him no more. \n[123]Dude. We go back a long, long way. You and me. We started this NWA shit. I just want it to be right. \n[124]You mean all he's done for you. \n[125]Look at me, man. Why won't you look at me? It's like I don't mean shit to you. Like I never meant shit. \n[126]Thought you were my brother. \n[127]None of this means anything, while I'm under contract with Ruthless. \n[128]Glad y'all came by. Your demo was tight. \n[129]Well listen, I'm workin' on a track for this movie called \"Deep Cover.\" I want you to get down on it. \n[130]  \n[131]What you fools doin' out here? \n[132] Snoop at the wheel, they ride listening to ATOMIC DOG by George Clinton. Snoop's at the wheel, smoking a JOINT , Dre shotgun, Warren G and D.O.C. in the back.  \n[133]I'm cool. \n[134]First time in my life, I feel like I'm forcin' it. \n[135]Too much outside interference -- Eazy and Jerry tryin' to starve me out. Playin' games with my money. Tryin' to get me back in there on my hands and knees -- \n[136]Nah, that ain't me. I'm good. \n[137] \n[138]Wow. What is in this shit? \n[139]No. I can feel it in my nuts, man. Is that normal? \n[140]      \n[141]           \n[142]You look like you're ready to go. \n[143]You're not having fun? \n[144]Yeah, it does get crazy around here sometimes. Hi, I'm Andre. \n[145]Hey Nicole, why don't you come over here with me and kick it for a while til your friend gets back. \n[146]Do it look like I give a fuck right now? Can't you see I'm tryin' to make a Love Connection? \n[147]A friend connection? \n[148]You want me to help you? \n[149]I'mma find you, Nicole! \n[150]Yeah.  Shit's crazy, right. \n[151]\n[152]What do you mean that everyone is passing on this record? \n[153]It's not hip-hop? Shit, it's the future. Ain't no more money in sampling everythang. \n[154]Okay, shoot. \n[155]Dre's cool. How are you doing? I heard John McClain gave you my album. What did you think? \n[156]I did. \n[157]I did. \n[158]Thank you. \n[159]Man, this is just the beginning... We're building an empire. \n[160]Suge, it's cool -- \n[161]Aren't you glad I tracked you down? \n[162]So wassup, you been havin' good time? \n[163]Well I mean, I like comin' over your place, but you know, your neighbors be complainin' about \"the noise\" -- \n[164]I think a little more privacy would be better. \n[165]Yeah, maybe. I know of a perfect spot. Plenty of room, and I know the owner. \n[166]Yeah. I'm really feelin' you like that. \n[167]Hey you know what, don't worry about it right now. Was just a thought... \n[168]Listen, I don't mean to change the temperature in here. But it had to be crazy, bein' married to a Laker. \n[169]Look, no offense, but I'm a little glad he was an asshole. His loss is my gain. To assholes. \n[170]Really? Good night? \n[171]No. \n[172]See, I can't help thinkin', maybe you want me to come inside... \n[173]So what's different now? \n[174]What do you mean? \n[175]But I thought we been havin fun. \n[176](A little dazed and \n[177]Where's Pac at? \n[178]Wha'up Pac? \n[179]Nigga what? I do...guess who I worked with last night. \n[180]Roger fuckin' Troutman. Man this shit is fire. Wait til you hear it. \n[181]I'm thinking about calling it California love. \n[182]Press play \n[183]What the fuck y'all doin? \n[184] \n[185]   \n[186]This shit is stupid! Do ya'll know what it took for us to get here. Do y'all know what you doin'? Y'all fuckin' it up! Y'all fucking it up! And what the fuck ya'll doing here?! \n[187]Really, ok... \n[188]Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us. This other shit -- is you! \n[189]'Tha fuck you talking too? \n[190]What the fuck?!!! \n[191]Get the fuck off me. \n[192]Come on, come on, come -- \n[193]Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway. \n[194]Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation. \n[195]`Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care. \n[196]I fucked up. But I've had a lot of time to think in here, and I promise you, things are gonna be different from now on. \n[197]  \n[198]Hello? \n[199]Yeah? Wassup wit you? \n[200]Yeah. Okay. Wassup? \n[201]Just makin' tracks. \n[202]Good lookin' out. \n[203]Really. Well it's about time. He's the reason why we broke up. \n[204]Yeah me too-- cause I'm not proud of all the shit I did, either. \n[205]Yeah, that's sounds cool -- Let's stay in touch. \n[206]What up. \n[207] \n[208]Good to see you, Cube. \n[209]He looks the same -- like Eric just sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a machine breathing for him -- \n[210]  \n[211]Okay. \n[212]He's gone. \n[213]I'm out, man. I'm out of Death Row. \n[214]Gonna do my own thing now. Start fresh. Nobody to answer to but myself. It's time, Suge. \n[215]What we created? Ha -- Well you can have it. \n[216]Do what you gotta do. I'm still out. \n[217]I don't give a fuck-- You can't put a price on peace of mind. So you can keep the artists, the money, the masters and the bullshit. I'm startin' my own thing. \n[218]Aftermath. ", "Tyree": "\n[1]Grabbed some of your stuff, man. \n[2]When you comin' back? \n[3]Can I come with you? \n[4]You know she's just want the best for you. \n[5]Do I know you!? \n[6]Nigga, you heard me! \n[7]Muthafucka over here lookin' at me like he know me! \n[8]Yo Dre, there's something outside you need to take care of. Trust me. \n[9]What happened, Dre? What she say? \n[10]Come on. I could meet up with y'all in Dallas or -- Yo, you gotta let me come fuck with you in Miami! \n[11]You know it! \n[12]You did. \n[13]So I'm paying for your shit? \n[14]She good, but nah, you know her, constantly workin'. \n[15] ", "Jerry": "\n[1]I heard your record. \n[2]Jerry Heller. \n[3]Pleasure to meet you. Would it be possible to have a word with you, Eric? \n[4]I thought your record was good. \n[5]No-no-no, hang on.  I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down. \n[6]Let's try this again. As a music manager, let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric -- \n[7]You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon -- \n[8]Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy. \n[9]That's what I do for you. I will make you legit. I will take you into that building. I will protect you. I will block out all the noise of this business and we can build something big. \n[10]But you're gonna have to believe in me like I believe in you. If you don't think you can do that... \n[11]You got more music for me? \n[12]Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway? No Whites Allowed? \n[13]Hey fellas, sorry I'm running late. I'll be honest. We've had a lot of passes. People are scared of you guys big time. They think you're dangerous. But I think that's a good thing. And we've had a couple nibbles, from a couple labels. Epic, Capitol, Priority... \n[14]Here's the thing. You guys can make a real record. Sell it nationwide. But we're not there yet. These labels, they're still gonna need some... convincing. So I invited a few of them to your show. So you have to kick ass tonight. Can you do that? \n[15]Let me go and make sure they're all here. \n[16]Try not to look so scared, Bryan. They smell it on ya, you're finished. \n[17]Relax. You're in for a real treat! \n[18]So what do ya think? \n[19]That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice. \n[20]This is Eazy E and NWA. Guys, this is Bryan Turner. \n[21]Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you. \n[22]Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform. \n[23]Our deal with Priority is done. I have the contracts for you to sign. \n[24] \n[25]The lyrics you're writing is really good, Cube. \n[26]The lawyers just started drawing them up. \n[27]Excuse me officer, what's going on out here?! \n[28]These are not thugs, they're artists! \n[29]They're rappers working in the studio right here. \n[30]I'm the manager. \n[31]   \n[32]This is only the tip of the iceberg, fellas. The days of selling records out of your trunk are a thing of the past, Eric. \n[33]Are you crazy? Had a enough of that shit in the 70's. I'll fly out a couple of times and check on'em. \n[34]What's wrong with that? Bryan, controversy's good -- It's gonna help us sell more records. \n[35]Excuse me. \n[36]What ya got in there, Mr. Wright? \n[37]Have you lost your mind? You are not taking that on the bus. \n[38]I'm not gonna let you take that arsenal on tour, Eric! \n[39] \n[40]Yeah well, you start making a little money, problems come with it. \n[41]Money problems are race neutral. But I'll help you through all of it. I'll put you in touch with -- \n[42]Evening, Cube... \n[43]It's all right, Eric. Cube's right to ask, and I'm remiss in not updating you guys. Contracts are being finalized as we speak. Truth is, attorneys will bleed you dry going over `em. Wish I was paid by the hour... \n[44]Everybody knows how important you are, Cube. Just give us a little more time. \n[45]He wants to be you so freaking bad. This kid has issues. At some point, you gotta trust somebody... \n[46]Moving up on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Holding our bullet the R&amp;B, Hip-Hop chart. I mean, you have any idea how many records we're selling? Ruthless has arrived. Eric, we are huge! \n[47]It's a warning. A message to our record label about \"Fuck the Police\". We should really think about not performing that song for a while. \n[48] \n[49]Well, uh. If that's what you wanna do, then maybe we -- \n[50]You have no right! This is illegal! You can't do this -- \n[51]What the fuck were you guys thinking? They can hold us libel for inciting a riot! No one cares that the police started it... \n[52]Whether you like it or not, you are a political group. Never give these assholes a reason to hurt you. Next time they might take it. \n[53]   \n[54]It's nice to see you, Cube. \n[55]I know you've been very eager to sign a contract with Eric's company, Ruthless Records. \n[56]That's incorrect. It's not my company. I work for you. I've made that clear from the beginning. \n[57]Cube, lawyers get paid to make trouble. That's what they do -- create problems where problems don't exist. \n[58]I can assure you, it's all standard. You can read it now, if you like. \n[59]Cube, I thought you knew? Everyone else signed already. You're the only one who hasn't. \n[60]Look. Cube. This is a great thing. This is what you always wanted your whole life. And there's also this. \n[61]Soon as you sign this contract, the money is all yours. \n[62]That's ridiculous. \n[63]You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free? \n[64]Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind. \n[65]It's gonna be fine, Eric. It's not just NWA anymore, it's our whole Ruthless roster. \n[66]We've got D.O.C., we've got Michel'le, we've got Above the Law. We're moving up to the next level. \n[67]Look at him. You think he needs anymore motivation than that? \n[68]You gotta stop worrying so much. Let me do the worrying for you. Fact is, Ren can write just as good as Cube. Maybe even better. Come over here a minute -- \n[69]Need your autograph on these checks and a few other things. Just sign right here -- \n[70]We're done. \n[71]   \n[72]We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard. Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight -- \n[73] \n[74]Well call Dre and you guys go do it! \n[75]    \n[76]Help you with something? \n[77]Who's asking? \n[78]Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube? \n[79]Just need a word with Dre -- \n[80]    \n[81]Jesus Christ, Eric. You can't just... I thought you were -- \n[82]Are yo okay? Eric. Why don't we go inside? All right? Come on... \n[83]  \n[84]Hey. You gotta tell me what's going on. I can tell when something's -- \n[85]You're not gonna do that. \n[86]You do that, it's gonna ruin everything we've built -- \n[87]Eric. Listen to me. I never said we won't hit back. But this isn't Compton. We don't hit back with bullets. We do it with lawyers. We drain those assholes. \n[88]Of course it is. You're smarter than those criminals. You wanna kill somebody? Then you'll be in prison, forever. No more family. No more Ruthless. No more anything. \n[89]If you kill this man. His problems are over and yours are just beginning -- Lets hit 'em where it really hurts. \n[90]  \n[91]We're about to get back into the game in a big way, Eric -- \n[92]Are you just trying to insult me? \n[93]Did you forget about Ren's album? Or the fact that you're working on an album that I believe is gonna be bigger than anything NWA ever -- \n[94]Dre's a fuckin' producer, Eric! Producer's don't rap! It's never gonna work! Period! \n[95]Eazy. You may wanna see this. \n[96]  \n[97]Sorry... \n[98]Eric -- \n[99]Can you come by my office? I need you to sign some checks -- \n[100]Eric -- \n[101]  \n[102]Wait, aren't you gonna sign -- \n[103]But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it -- \n[104]I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost -- \n[105]  \n[106]Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you -- \n[107]So what was it, the groupie? The executive assistant? Did she even go to college? Come on. You're smarter than that, Eric -- \n[108]Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork -- \n[109]Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight. \n[110]I know what's best for you, and for Ruthless, and we've built a trust over years of hard work. That trust is our foundation, Eric. \n[111]Are you okay? You don't look -- \n[112]Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric. \n[113]Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we do things! This is a business and I won't let you -- ", "Heller": "\n[1]I heard your record. \n[2]Hey fellas, sorry I'm running late. I'll be honest. We've had a lot of passes. People are scared of you guys big time. They think you're dangerous. But I think that's a good thing. And we've had a couple nibbles, from a couple labels. Epic, Capitol, Priority... \n[3]Here's the thing. You guys can make a real record. Sell it nationwide. But we're not there yet. These labels, they're still gonna need some... convincing. So I invited a few of them to your show. So you have to kick ass tonight. Can you do that? \n[4]Let me go and make sure they're all here. \n[5]What's wrong with that? Bryan, controversy's good -- It's gonna help us sell more records. ", "Warren": "\n[1]My bad. \n[2]Watching you daydream for the last five minutes. \n[3]No you not. You been up in that house for a month now, and not one track? Wassup, what's wrong? \n[4]Why? \n[5]Come on, big bro. Loosen up. \n[6]Yo Dre, we're can I dump this shit? \n[7]Aiight, regulate that shit! \n[8]Your house is on fire. \n[9]Maybe I shouldn't have thrown them coals in the trash. ", "G": "\n[1]              \n[2]  \n[3]     \n[4]\n[5]HOUSE -- lots of YELLING as they PIN everyone to the floor, it's too late, nobody can escape; nobody but -- \n[6]     BAM-BAM! A fist on a locked door. The music stops as Dre removes his headphones. We now see --  DRE'S ROOM, populated with turn tables -- one side spinning the record he's listening to -- DJ station and a vast sea of LPs scattered around the room. A music junkie's paradise.  On the other bed, his brother TYREE  chills as Dre opens the door to find --  \n[7]    \n[8]  \n[9]\n[10]Shut the fuck up, Blood! You young muthafuckas wanna die today?! \n[11]\n[12]You little Crab ass niggas could've got this whole bus shot the fuck up! We saw that bullshit you was throwing up out the window!

If not, I might be the one that kill yo' dumb ass! Remember me! This that Crenshaw Mafia, Blood! \n[15]  \n[16]    \n[17]   \n[18]You really wanna be here? This club is full of Pirus. \n[19]ATHLETES. A true hood cross-section. AS WE MOVE through the place, we see CUBE, JINX and TYREE standing near the wall: JINX and TYREE are busy clocking the GIRLS, but CUBE is studying a ripped-out page of LYRICS. ON STAGE, wearing purple satin jackets with WORLD CLASS WRECKIN CRU on the back, DRE spins some `80s R&amp;B while his boy, YELLA, leans down, hollers at a GIRL in the crowd. Dre spots someone moving through the mass of people -- \n[20]  \n[21] \n[22]  \n[23]  \n[24]  \n[25]   \n[26]1580 KDAY, this is Greg Mack -- Mack Attack. That was \"Boyz n tha Hood\" by Eazy-E, local rapper out of Compton. Sounds like he's about 15 years old -- \n[27]-- I know you like it. It's been the most requested record on this station ever since I played it. The freshest song of 1986 -- \n[28]  \n[29]   \n[30]  \n[31] IN THE BACK OF THE CLUB, from a corner, a big man is watching, mind going, This is SUGE KNIGHT.   \n[32] \n[33]Back and forth. Doing some bodyguard work among other things. If ya'll need my services, just let me know. \n[34]You never know what you need until you need it. \n[35]I just came back here to give ya'll your props. I got my people out here waiting on me. But I'll be around. \n[36]  \n[37] \n[38]\n[39] \n[40]   \n[41]   \n[42]THUMPING from DIFFERENT CARS flossing on the `Shaw. Literally, every car. LOW-RIDERS bounce their hydraulics in approval. PEDESTRIANS HOLLER at the RIDERS and Riders holler back. It's like the entire hood is partying. And in the thick of it all -- Eazy, Dre, and Cube creep down Crenshaw in Eazy's `64 Impala, Ren and Yella just behind them in Yella's Porche. They can't believe their eyes, their hood now worshipping their music. Some full circle shit... \n[43]   \n[44]  \n[45]   \n[46]     \n[47] 46pt1   INT.

Heard she was up here in one of these rooms. \n[50]Mind if I take a look? \n[51]You forgot my name, muthafucka? \n[52]She in there or what? \n[53]What the fuck did you say? \n[54]For the sake of our children, I implore each of you to be unyielding and inflexible in your opposition to drugs. Our young people are helping us lead the way. Not long ago in Oakland, California, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs. And I answered, just say no. \n[55]  \n[56]   \n[57]    \n[58]   \n[59] 55pt1   -- Rural farmland. Flyover-ville.

BOUNCING and THRASHING like a MOSH PIT. Pure ELECTRICITY--  Jerry Heller is suddenly alarmed by the song selection.  As Cube slices throughout the first verse --  Cops are getting agitated -- Waiting for the order to pounce. After their CAPTAIN has seen enough-- He gives the order.  At that moment, the PLAINCLOTHES COPS in the crowd pull out their BADGES and start MOVING FORWARD through the sea of people, trying to make their way to the STAGE --  Cube keeps SPITTING -- lyrics are approaching that mighty hook.  The UNDERCOVER COPS are causing a lot of commotion in the crowd... When CUBE hits the hook the CROWD JOINS IN, because they know all the lyrics --  \n[68]  \n[69]  \n[70]   \n[71]  \n[72]   \n[73]  \n[74]Are you? \n[75]Just figured you might be a bit fucked up after hearin' Cube's shit. \n[76]I'm on it. \n[77]\n[78]  \n[79]  \n[80]  \n[81]Doc shouldn't even be alive. He got thrown from the car-- hit a tree. \n[82]Nah. His throat got crushed. Doctor said he'll never talk right again. \n[83]All fucked up. Career could be in jeopardy . Where's Eazy and Jerry? \n[84]Them niggas ain't loyal. Taking they're fuckin' time to come see the man. That's why I got my people looking into his contracts at Ruthless. Gotta protect what he got left. \n[85]What do you think about Jerry? \n[86]What about your paperwork? Is it cool? \n[87]Most definitely. I can arrange that. \n[88]  \n[89]   \n[90]    \n[91]This your house? \n[92]It's a real nice house. \n[93]Have yourself a good night, Jerry. \n[94] \n[95]Ruthless, muthafuckas! \n[96]  \n[97]It can wait. Let the man work. \n[98]Yo Dre. Hold up. \n[99]I did what you asked. Had my people look into your contracts. \n[100]It ain't good. Not that I'm surprised or anything. Gotta watch yourself. \n[101]Everything you need to know. It's all in there. \n[102] \n[103]   \n[104]This shit sounds good. \n[105]Don't worry about that. I promise you that I'll get you out of your contracts. \n[106]Yo who the fuck's this, Warren? \n[107]My bad. \n[108]  \n[109]We need to talk about them contracts. \n[110]Don't wanna talk to Jerry. It's your company. You're the man. \n[111]Come by the studio. We'll be here all night. Just workin'. We just wanna squash this. Make it right for you. \n[112]   \n[113]Don't worry about Dre.  Truth be told, he ain't got nothing to do with this right here. \n[114]Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna sign these. Releasing Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless. \n[115]Naw. I think you gonna stay awhile. \n[116]You can talk tough all you want-- but this ain't no record. Don't make me change you, Eric Wright. \n[117]These niggas will take something from you that you can't get back. \n[118]Naw. That's too easy. I got a whole night planned for you if you don't sign them release forms. \n[119]It could happen quick, Eric. Or it could take a long, long time. You better choose right. Because you know where I come from. This Bompton nigga! \n[120]   \n[121]  \n[122]Watching you daydream for the last five minutes. \n[123] Snoop at the wheel, they ride listening to ATOMIC DOG by George Clinton. Snoop's at the wheel, smoking a JOINT , Dre shotgun, Warren G and D.O.C. in the back.  \n[124]No you not. You been up in that house for a month now, and not one track? Wassup, what's wrong? \n[125]Why? \n[126]Come on, big bro. Loosen up. \n[127]      \n[128] \n[129]Yo Dre, we're can I dump this shit? \n[130]Aiight, regulate that shit! \n[131]Your house is on fire. \n[132]Maybe I shouldn't have thrown them coals in the trash. \n[133]What do you think? \n[134]They all turned it down. \"Too many live instruments. It's not hip- hop.\" \n[135]This guy has a lot of money. This is the only shot we got. \n[136]We'd love to bring it to Interscope. But there's a problem. \n[137]Ruthless. Lawsuits. Contracts. \n[138]  \n[139]  \n[140]   \n[141]  \n[142]  \n[143]Times are hard. Eazy's not ballin' like he was. Surrounded by MOVING BOXES and basic studio equipment, a few HOMIES do their thing on the board, the makings of NEIGHBORHOOD SNIPER playing, as Eazy, Ren and Yella huddle over -- THREE HUGE, ONE-POUND BAGS OF WEED sit on the coffee table. They divide them into smaller BAGS. \n[144]   \n[145]You're in my spot! \n[146]Did you park in my muthafuckin' parking space or not? \n[147]Now move yo' piece of shit and park my car. \n[148]-- And I bet not see one drop of blood in that mothafucka. \n[149]   \n[150]  \n[151]   \n[152]Dre, you want to put some money on this red nose? \n[153]Studio A... \n[154]   \n[155]  \n[156] \n[157]Don't forget to toast Dr. Dre. you little bitch ass mothafucka! \n[158]Its okay, Dre. \n[159] \n[160]Better watch ya mouth, Blood. \n[161] \n[162]Man don't even trip off this muthafucka.

Death Row and Dr. Dre are one in the same. You can't just up and go. \n[178]You're one stupid muthafucka. You just gonna throw away all this money? `Cause if you leave, everything we created is mine. \n[179]You ain't takin nobody with you. Death Row stays Death Row. And if you even think about touching my money? You know how I handle shit. \n[180]You're not gettin none of it. \n[181]What you gonna call it? ", "D.O.C.": "\n[1]72. \n[2]Wuddup, Dre.

Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary. Ice Cube would like to say, That I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way.

What the hell was THAT? Gunfire? A fucking BOMB? Whatever it was, TOTAL CHAOS BREAKS OUT --  The CROWD starts SURGING for the EXITS. Suddenly, DOZENS MORE COPS have MATERIALIZED OUT OF NOWHERE --  All the members of NWA DROP their mics and rush off stage, while the Arena descends into mayhem behind them --   \n[23]Here we go y'all... \n[24]\n[25]  \n[26]   \n[27]  \n[28]  \n[29]  \n[30]  \n[31]Driver!

Cause he looks like a one of my old muthafuckin' history teachers. \n[29]Yeah, I trust you.

Talk some truth and people lose they minds. \n[42]Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Ice Cube, from a gang called Niggaz With Attitudes. When I'm called off, I got a sawed off, squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off -- \n[43]Indianapolis in the muthafuckin' house! \n[44]Meet y'all upstairs. \n[45]What's the deal on them contracts, Jerry? I'm still waitin' on 'em... \n[46]Yeah me too. I just like to know what's goin' on. Since I wrote a lot of lyrics on this record. \n[47]Shit's pretty good. Someday, huh? \n[48]Know what don't make sense? Eazy chillin' with Jerry eatin' steak and lobster while we at Mickey D's. That shit don't make sense. \n[49]Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious-- \n[50]Check this out -- \n[51]\"... advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\" Have they ever heard of freedom of speech? What the fuck can they do to us? \n[52]If it was from the LAPD, then I'd be worried. \n[53]I guess freedom of speech don't mean shit. \n[54]Are we finished, man? We got a show to do. \n[55]Yo hold up, hold up -- Y'all know what the muthafuckin' po-lice just told us back stage? They tired to tell us-- what the fuck we can't say-- what the fuck we can't play! \n[56]Put ya middle finger in the air! \n[57]This NWA -- We do what the fuck we wanna do! We say what the fuck we wanna say! So, all I wanna tell that cop talking shit back stage is -- Yo Dre, I got something to say! \n[58]\n[59]Here we go y'all... \n[60]My art is the reflection of my reality. What do you see when you go outside of your door. I know what i see. \n[61]And by the way, the hood gets AKs from Russia and cocaine from Columbia. \n[62]WE must of struck a nerve. \n[63]Hell no. Last I heard, this is America and we got Freedom of Speech. Pretty sure that includes rap music. Exercisin' our Free Speech across this whole damn country, openin' people's eyes. Far as I'm concerned that's our job. \n[64]Well I can barely see you, Jerry. What's with all this Godfather shit? \n[65]It's your company too, right? You and Eric. All for one, one for all. \n[66]Alright, cool. So I can take this one, show it to a lawyer or somethin'? \n[67]But I have no idea what it says. At least let me take it to show my family. \n[68]Jerry, you know I can't understand this legal shit. None of us can. That's why we need to show it to a lawyer-- \n[69]What the fuck..? \n[70]Damn.  Thanks, man. \n[71]That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months. \n[72]Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me? \n[73]Give me my money, Jerry. \n[74]Why all this now,   Jerry? Back in the beginning, if   you thought we were so good, why   didn't you just give us contracts   then? \n[75]I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody? \n[76]Bye, Jerry. \n[77]Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer? \n[78]Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. Thought we talked about this, dude? \n[79]At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat! \n[80]Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre? \n[81]Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter. \n[82]Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless. \n[83]How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours? \n[84]Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day. \n[85]You believe in love at first sight? \n[86]Yeah, I'm tired of the games. Eazy puts everything on Jerry and Jerry puts everything on Eazy. They can have it. \n[87]Well get ready--   `cause these albums are gonna   be comin' real fast. I'm hungry   and I got a lot to say that's gonna   fuck the world up. \n[88]If I can't get the best producer in the in the west. I gotta go get the best in the east. \n[89]Kickin' shit called street knowledge. Why more niggas in the pen than in college? Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate. That's from the nigga ya love to hate. \n[90]Yeah, HA-HA! I'm the nigga ya love to hate -- \n[91]I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said. \n[92]Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means. \n[93]Man, I got a kid on the way -- and I just bought a house on the strength of what you told me. You gave me your word. \n[94]It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine? \n[95]But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'. \n[96]Shoulda kept your word, Bryan. \n[97]79. \n[98]What you got, Bryan? I know you called me up here for somethin'. \n[99]Benedict Arnold. \n[100]I'm a traitor!? I didn't say shit about NWA on Amerikkka's Most Wanted! But now they're trying to diss. Okay. \n[101]I can't wait to get to the mothafuckin' studio! \n[102]God DAMN I'm glad y'all set it off. Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft. First you was down with the AK. And now I see you on a video with Michel'le. Lookin' like straight Bozos. I saw it comin', that's why I went solo. \n[103]Yella Boy's on your team so you're LOSIN'! And yo, Dre? Stick to producin'. Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-A-Dick. Eazy saw your ass, and went in it QUICK. \n[104]Y'all disgrace the C-P-T. `Cause you gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy, with No Vaseline. \n[105]... So don't believe what Ren say, cause he goin out like Kunta Kinte. But I got a whip for ya, Toby; used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me -- \n[106]You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot. With your manager, fella, fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella. But if they were smart as me, Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree. With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline. Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on. Til that Jheri curl is gone. On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation. Heard you both got the same bank account -- Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' about? Get rid of that Devil real simple: put a bullet in his temple. Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew with a white Jew tellin' you what to do -- \n[107]Fuck'd y'all say!? \n[108]  \n[109]What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial? \n[110]I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation? \n[111]Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue - - \n[112]Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes. \n[113]There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a \"sandbag reporter\" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's \"Black Korea,\" and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent? \n[114]   \n[115]Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea? \n[116]Damn... We left some good records on the table... \n[117]All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be \"ON\" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know. \n[118]Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky. \n[119] \n[120] \n[121]Thought you said it was an after- school special. \n[122]Missed you too, E. Wish we could've work shit out. \n[123]Never should've dissed each other in the first place. Made our fans choice between us. That ain't cool. \n[124]Nope. I was reminiscing with my wife the other day. What it felt like-- In the beginning. We were so young and ferocious. Doing music straight for the hood. Trying to be ghetto stars... I thought I knew everything back then -- But I didn't know shit. \n[125]Yeah. I get it. Everything changes so fast. Feels like it was 20 years ago. If we were still together do you know how large we'd be? \n[126]I'd be lyin' if I said I never thought about it. \n[127]If you can get Dre to do it, I'm in. But check this out homie-- I ain't doin' it if Jerry's around. He done made enough off us. \n[128]Cool. We done talked til the damn club closed -- I got a car coming. You need a ride back to your hotel? \n[129] \n[130]    \n[131]S'up Dre? \n[132]You see him? How he look? \n[133]Can't see him like that, man. This is bad. I asked one of his homies to call me when he wakes up. \n[134]  ", "Kim": "\n[1]Kim. \n[2]What you think? \n[3]I don't think so-- after hearing everything that happened, I would've left too. Now he has the chance to showcase all his talents. \n[4]The new house is great. Thanks for asking. How's the new office? \n[5]They're trying to call you some kind of a traitor. \n[6]Baby, tell me what you're thinking. \n[7]Look how young you guys look. \n[8]Well-- ain't nobody burnt down the table did they? Ever thought about getting back together? \n[9]That's a shame. It's terrible how money tears us apart. ", "DJ": "", "Yella": "\n[1]Why not? \n[2]Don't trip off him, homie. \n[3]Yo! \n[4]Lonzo, what you think? \n[5]Man, kiss my ass, I ain't got no Raider gear.-- Are we gettin' paid to wear that shit? \n[6]Can this muthafucka Jerry Heller bring in more pussy? That's worth 20 percent! \n[7]Did you see all the freaks that was out there? Lord, thank God for biker shorts! \n[8]Man, pussy is power. \n[9]Yeah, no doubt. \n[10]You cool? \n[11] \n[12]Whoa! Eazy, you can't be blastin inside the hotel -- \n[13]Yo, Dre. What's goin' on? \n[14] \n[15]And it ain't glamorous. \n[16]I can't wait to get out of that \"po- man's Porsche\" and get me some real shit -- \n[17]For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract! \n[18]Guess that dude's \"managing\" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act... \n[19]For real. Cube killed it -- \n[20]That shit's kinda funny. \n[21]I don't know about all that. \n[22]Yo where Dre at anyway -- \n[23]Whatchu mean? \n[24]So all this weed. It's for your Ruthless artists? \n[25]Maybe you should think about diversifying into my kinda shit. There's money in there, too. \n[26]Hey so, when are Dre and Cube gonna roll in here? \n[27]Yo, you alright, Eazy? \n[28]It's Bone Thugs' new LP. It's good, Eric. It's gonna be huge when it drops. Everybody thinks so. Want me to play it for you? ", "Nicole": "\n[1] \n[2]Oh no, it was fun. I had a lot of fun. But now it's starting to get a little wild. \n[3]I don't know, maybe another time and another place. But not now. \n[4]No, he's trying make a friend connection. \n[5]Speaking of friends, I need to go find mine before she gets too lost. \n[6]No, seems like you need to get back to your game. I'll talk to you later. \n[7]I wasn't exactly hiding. \n[8]Yeah... Why? \n[9]So what, you want me to move? \n[10]After a few months, you sure you're ready for that, Andre? \n[11]I'm feelin' you too, but... \n[12]Wasn't what I'd call a good fit. It got crazy once we moved to L.A. I definitely went through some unnecessary shit when he started acting like an asshole. But I have a beautiful son and all that other nonsense is behind me now. \n[13] \n[14]   \n[15]All right -- Good night. \n[16]Are you okay to drive? \n[17]Good night, Andre. \n[18]Of course I do. \n[19]I got a lot of things to think about. You're asking me to move in... That's a big step. I like you, Andre. But there's a lot going on around you. \n[20]I read the papers. I'm not stupid. I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting... Just seems dangerous. My son's my world. \n[21]Fun is fun, Andre. But I refuse to walk away from one crazy life into another. \n[22]I'll a call you. \n[23]Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row? \n[24]112 days? That doesn't even make sense. \n[25]You got one phone call and you called me? \n[26]You take care of yourself, Andre. \n[27]It's for you. ", "Tomica": "\n[1]This place is nice. Wow, I didn't realize this was a real \"date\" date. I thought we were just going out to eat. You bring all your females here? \n[2]You know I have a job, right? \n[3]Executive Assistant. Ya know, you don't have to impress me. We could've went to Fat Burgers. I just like hangin with you. You make me laugh. That's good enough for me, you know? We can just chill. \n[4]Yeah, she had a nice ass. But she might wanna fix those teeth. \n[5]I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you. \n[6]You had to know the truth sometime. Now you do. \n[7]Eric! \n[8]You gonna say something? Is it a respiratory infection -- pneumonia? \n[9]No. We can beat this. Together. \n[10]Who was that? \n[11]I can't. That's not the way it should happen. It's not right -- \n[12]Don't say that. \n[13]It's so... fucked up -- \n[14]Okay. I love you, Eric. "}}
