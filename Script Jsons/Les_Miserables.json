And remember when you've nicked him It was me what told you so. \n[61]I smell profit here! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt.

Shouldn't be too hard to sell. \n[72]Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood. \n[73]Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet. It's a world where the dog eats the dog. Where they kill for the bones in the street. And God in his heaven, He don't interfere Cos he's dead as the stiff at my feet! I raise my eyes to see the heavens And only the moon looks down. The harvest moon shines down! \n[74]There! That way! \n[75]I forget where we met... Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge Where the Duke did that Puke Down the Duchess's decolletage? \n[76]He's not fooled! Told you so! Show M'Sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know! \n[77]Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss. \n[78]  \n[79]What I saw, clear as light, Jean Valjean in the sewers that night, Had this corpse on his back Some boy he'd killed in a viscious attack. I was there, never fear! Even found me this fine souvenir! \n[80]And there's more! Mark this well - It was the night that the barricades fell. \n[81]Jean Valjean - the old con.

Raised in a convent Cash to spare - We want our share. \n[83]Quite the little nun, ain't she! \n[84] The convent. \n[85]Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat? Hob-nobbin' here Among the elite? Here comes a prince There goes a Jew This one's a queer But what can you do? Paris at my feet! Paris in the dust! And here's me breaking bread With the upper crust - \n[86]Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance! Life is easy pickings If you grab your chance! \n[87]Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent \n[88]But they're mostly broke! \n[89]Singing to the Lord on Sundays \n[90]Praying for the gifts he'll send - \n[91]But we're the ones who take it - We're the ones who make it in the end! \n[92]Watch the buggers dance \n[93]Watch'em till they drop! \n[94]Keep your wits about you And you stand on top! \n[95]Masters of the land \n[96]Always get our share \n[97]Clear away the barricades And we're still there! We know where the wind is blowing Money is the stuff we smell - And when we're rich as Croesus, Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!

She has nothing to hide? \n[2]At the end of the day she's the one who began it! \n[3]Yes, it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter And her father abandoned us, Leaving us flat. Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife And I pay for the child. What's the matter with that? \n[4]M'sieur Mayor, help me! I have a child! \n[5]Excuse me, is this where the Pawnbrokers is? \n[6]Thank you. \n[7]It's worth at least ten. \n[8]Alright, five. \n[9]Don't touch me! Leave me alone! \n[10]It pays a debt... \n[11]What can I do? It pays a debt. Ten francs may save my poor Cosette. \n[12]Please, you wouldn't have any work for me would you? Please, I sold you my hair. I could do anything. \n[13]You'll pay me first What I am due. \n[14]Come on, Captain, you can wear your shoes. Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse? \n[15]Easy money lying on a bed. Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head! Don't they know they're making love To one already dead? \n[16]There was a time when men were kind, When their voices were soft And their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting. There was a time... Then it all went wrong. I dreamed a dream in time gone by, When hope was high And life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. \n[17]        \n[18]I don't want you! No! No, M'sieur! Let me go! \n[19]No, not at all! \n[20]I'll kill you, you bastard! Try any of that! Even a whore who has gone to the bad Won't be had by a rat! \n[21]I beg you, don't report me, sir. I'll do whatever you may want. \n[22]There's a child who sorely needs me, Please, m'sieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die. \n[23]Can this be? \n[24]M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray It's hard enough I've lost my pride. You let your foreman send me away. Yes, you were there And turned aside. I never did no wrong. \n[25]My daughter's close to dying. \n[26]If there's a God above - \n[27]He'd let me die instead. \n[28]Bring Cosette back to me. \n[29]At an inn in Montfermeil... \n[30]Cosette, it's turned so cold! Cosette, it's past your bedtime! You've played the day away And soon it will be night. Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading. \n[31]Don't you see, the evening star appearing? Come to me, and rest against my shoulder, How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder? \n[32] \n[33]My Cosette - \n[34]Take her now! \n[35]Good m'sieur, you come from God in heaven. \n[36]Take my hand... The night grows ever colder. \n[37]Take my child I give her to your keeping. \n[38]For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping...

You got me this job as a gardener! \n[6]In this place of Holy Orders You are brought to God's domain May the sisters grant you shelter May their prayers ease your pain.

There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong. \n[5]Sit, my brother. \n[6]Madame, set one more place. Please sit. \n[7]May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest. Please, eat.

Would you leave the best behind? \n[16] \n[17]But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, \n[18]By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God. \n[19]And remember The truth that once was spoken: To love another person Is to see the face of God... ", "Myriel": "", "Jean": "\n[1]Yes. It means I'm free. \n[2]I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving. \n[3]I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law! \n[4]My name is Jean Valjean! \n[5]Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins \n[6]And now lets see What this new world Will do for me! \n[7]Monsieur can I help? A day's work? \n[8]Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? \n[9]Pontarlier. \n[10]No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. \n[11]You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? \n[12]What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! \n[13]I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? \n[14]I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. \n[15]I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! \n[16]Another story must begin! \n[17]What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus. \n[18]Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute. \n[19] \n[20]Welcome, sir Come guard our laws I'm sure we're here In common cause. \n[21]The dignity of toil To stay alive. \n[22]Your face is not a face I would forget. \n[23]Get back! It may fall! \n[24]Say what you must. Don't leave it there. \n[25]Let me help you up. \n[26]No more cart driving for you! \n[27]A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale. \n[28]You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail. \n[29]Where will she end - This child without a friend? \n[30]I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this? \n[31]Is it true what I've done - \n[32]- to an innocent soul? \n[33]Had I only known then! \n[34]In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital. \n[35]Where is she? \n[36]I will see it done! I will send for her immediately! \n[37]I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert? \n[38]You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence? \n[39]You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post. \n[40]It's your duty to obey! \n[41]They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance! Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far And struggled for so long? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[42]I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I speak they are condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[43]    \n[44]   \n[45]Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? \n[46]My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! \n[47]And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? 24601! \n[48]If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me. \n[49]Is her daughter with her? \n[50]`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this? \n[51]Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side \n[52] \n[53]- shall live in my protection. \n[54]Your child will want for nothing. \n[55]And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living. \n[56]Then I will keep you warm. \n[57]Take shelter from the storm. \n[58]Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return... \n[59]Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done! \n[60]I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run! \n[61]And this I swear to you tonight - \n[62]Your child will live within my care - \n[63]And I will raise her to the light. \n[64]I swear to you, I will be there! \n[65]Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live. \n[66]Tell me, my child, what is your name? \n[67]Cosette? \n[68]I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away. This is a duty I must heed. There is a promise I have made. For I was blind to one in need, I did not see what stood before me. Now your mother is with God. Her suffering is over, And I speak here with her voice, And I stand here in her place, and from this day, and ever more - \n[69]Cosette shall live in my protection. \n[70]I will not forget my vow. \n[71]Cosette shall have a father now. \n[72]Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed. \n[73]Now may I say we are agreed? \n[74]No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget. \n[75]Where I go, you will be. \n[76]Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you! \n[77]Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace \n[78]And delight. How was I to know That so much love Was held inside me? Something fresh and young Something still unsung Fills the night. How was I to know at last That happiness can come so fast? Trusting me the way you do I'm so afraid of failing you Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share Nevermore alone Nevermore apart You have warmed my heart Like the sun. You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me. Suddenly I see What I could not see Something suddenly Has begun. \n[79]Who are you? \n[80]Monsieur Fauchelevent! \n[81]Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear. \n[82]We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again. \n[83]What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say! \n[84]  \n[85]Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company. \n[86]No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid. \n[87]You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn. \n[88]Cosette! Cosette! \n[89]  \n[90]My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. \n[91]This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past! \n[92]Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns. \n[93]We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette! \n[94]Rue de L'Homme Armee. \n[95]And then a ship across the sea. \n[96]Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away! \n[97]Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day! \n[98]One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more! \n[99]One day more! \n[100]One day more! \n[101]One day more! \n[102]One day more! \n[103]Tomorrow we'll be far away. \n[104]Tomorrow is the judgement day. \n[105]I'll take it. \n[106]  \n[107]`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.' \n[108]They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy \n[109]Don't shoot! \n[110]I come here as a volunteer. \n[111]That's why they let me through. \n[112]There's much that I can do. \n[113]Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do. \n[114]Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him. \n[115]We meet again... \n[116]You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands. \n[117]Get out of here. \n[118]Clear out of here! \n[119]You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again. \n[120]Go! \n[121]God on high Hear my prayer \n[122]In my need You have always been there. He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! He's like the son I might have known If God had granted me a son. The summers die One by one How soon they fly On and on And I am old And will be gone. Bring him peace Bring him joy He is young He is only a boy. You can take You can give Let him be Let him live, If I die, let me die Let him live Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! \n[123]Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear. \n[124]How do I get out of here? \n[125]It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care. \n[126]Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid. \n[127]Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave! \n[128]Then I die. \n[129]She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free... \n[130]Love is the garden of the young Let it be Let it be! A heart full of love This I give you this day. \n[131]Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done... \n[132]There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime. \n[133]Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I? \n[134]Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know... \n[135]...What I have spoken, why I must go. \n[136]Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home! \n[137]I am ready, Fantine... \n[138]At the end of my days... \n[139]She's the best of my life... \n[140]Cosette? \n[141]Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day! \n[142]Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed... \n[143]Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try... \n[144]On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping. It's the story Of one who turned from hating A man who only learned to love When you were in his keeping. \n[145]I'm ready now, Fantine. \n[146]Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory! \n[147]And remember The truth that once was spoken: To love another person Is to see the face of God... ", "Valjean": "\n[1]Yes. It means I'm free. \n[2]I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving. \n[3]I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law! \n[4]My name is Jean Valjean! \n[5]Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins \n[6]And now lets see What this new world Will do for me! \n[7]Monsieur can I help? A day's work? \n[8]Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? \n[9]Pontarlier. \n[10]No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. \n[11]You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? \n[12]What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! \n[13]I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? \n[14]I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. \n[15]I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! \n[16]Another story must begin! \n[17]What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus. \n[18]Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute. \n[19] \n[20]Welcome, sir Come guard our laws I'm sure we're here In common cause. \n[21]The dignity of toil To stay alive. \n[22]Your face is not a face I would forget. \n[23]Get back! It may fall! \n[24]Say what you must. Don't leave it there. \n[25]Let me help you up. \n[26]No more cart driving for you! \n[27]A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale. \n[28]You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail. \n[29]Where will she end - This child without a friend? \n[30]I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this? \n[31]Is it true what I've done - \n[32]- to an innocent soul? \n[33]Had I only known then! \n[34]In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital. \n[35]Where is she? \n[36]I will see it done! I will send for her immediately! \n[37]I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert? \n[38]You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence? \n[39]You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post. \n[40]It's your duty to obey! \n[41]They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance! Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far And struggled for so long? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[42]I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I speak they are condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[43]    \n[44]   \n[45]Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? \n[46]My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! \n[47]And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? 24601! \n[48]If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me. \n[49]Is her daughter with her? \n[50]`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this? \n[51]Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side \n[52] \n[53]- shall live in my protection. \n[54]Your child will want for nothing. \n[55]And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living. \n[56]Then I will keep you warm. \n[57]Take shelter from the storm. \n[58]Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return... \n[59]Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done! \n[60]I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run! \n[61]And this I swear to you tonight - \n[62]Your child will live within my care - \n[63]And I will raise her to the light. \n[64]I swear to you, I will be there! \n[65]Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live. \n[66]Tell me, my child, what is your name? \n[67]Cosette? \n[68]I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away. This is a duty I must heed. There is a promise I have made. For I was blind to one in need, I did not see what stood before me. Now your mother is with God. Her suffering is over, And I speak here with her voice, And I stand here in her place, and from this day, and ever more - \n[69]Cosette shall live in my protection. \n[70]I will not forget my vow. \n[71]Cosette shall have a father now. \n[72]Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed. \n[73]Now may I say we are agreed? \n[74]No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget. \n[75]Where I go, you will be. \n[76]Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you! \n[77]Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace \n[78]And delight. How was I to know That so much love Was held inside me? Something fresh and young Something still unsung Fills the night. How was I to know at last That happiness can come so fast? Trusting me the way you do I'm so afraid of failing you Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share Nevermore alone Nevermore apart You have warmed my heart Like the sun. You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me. Suddenly I see What I could not see Something suddenly Has begun. \n[79]Who are you? \n[80]Monsieur Fauchelevent! \n[81]Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear. \n[82]We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again. \n[83]What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say! \n[84]  \n[85]Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company. \n[86]No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid. \n[87]You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn. \n[88]Cosette! Cosette! \n[89]  \n[90]My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. \n[91]This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past! \n[92]Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns. \n[93]We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette! \n[94]Rue de L'Homme Armee. \n[95]And then a ship across the sea. \n[96]Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away! \n[97]Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day! \n[98]One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more! \n[99]One day more! \n[100]One day more! \n[101]One day more! \n[102]One day more! \n[103]Tomorrow we'll be far away. \n[104]Tomorrow is the judgement day. \n[105]I'll take it. \n[106]  \n[107]`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.' \n[108]They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy \n[109]Don't shoot! \n[110]I come here as a volunteer. \n[111]That's why they let me through. \n[112]There's much that I can do. \n[113]Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do. \n[114]Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him. \n[115]We meet again... \n[116]You talk too much.

It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave. \n[3]This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man. \n[4]You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law. \n[5]Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601! \n[6]And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me - 24601! \n[7]I introduce myself, Inspector of Police. I've come to take the watch I'm here to keep the peace. Please know me as Javert. I'm here at your command With honour due to each. With justice in our hands No man's beyond our reach. Let all beware. \n[8]You've done the city proud, You've raised their banner high. \n[9]You manufacture gems That anyone can buy Your people thrive. \n[10]It seems to me We may have met. \n[11]Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared. \n[12]Forgive me, sir. I would not dare - \n[13]Monsieur le Mayor. \n[14]Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl? \n[15]She will answer for her actions When you make a full report. You may rest assured, M'sieur, That she will answer to the court. \n[16]I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years.

I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same. \n[24]I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court. \n[25]And of course the thief denies it, You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean. \n[26]He will pay, and so must I.

But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done! \n[39]Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid. \n[40]But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run? \n[41]Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him. \n[42]And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean? \n[43]   \n[44]There, out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face...

I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel. \n[53]I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight.

How right you should kill with a knife. \n[57]Don't understand... \n[58]Valjean, take care! I'm warning you. \n[59]Once a thief, forever a thief. What you want, you always steal. You would trade your life for mine. Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert! \n[60]I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed! \n[61]The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice! \n[62]One more step and you die. \n[63]Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting... 24601! \n[64]Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life! \n[65]Damned if I live in the debt of a thief! Damned if I yield at the end of the chase! \n[66]I am the law and the law is not mocked! I'll spit his pity right back in his face! There is nothing on earth that we share! It is either Valjean or Javert! How can I allow this man To hold dominion over me? This desperate man that I have hunted... He gave me my life! He gave me freedom! I should have perished by his hand It was his right... It was my right to die as well... Instead I live... But live in hell! \n[67]And my thoughts fly apart Can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved? And must I now begin to doubt Who never doubted all those years? My heart is stone and still it trembles... The world I have known is lost in shadow Is he from heaven or from hell? And does he know That granting me my life today This man has killed me even so? \n[68]I am reaching but I fall And the stars are black and cold As I stare into the void Of a world that cannot hold...
