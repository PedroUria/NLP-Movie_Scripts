Richard Crookback? \n[9]Who wrote that? \n[10]Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona. \n[11]Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds? \n[12]Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over. \n[13] \n[14]To my weekly confession. \n[15]Words, words, words\u0085once, I had the gift\u0085I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones\u0085for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery\u0085but now \n[16] \n[17]I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. \n[18]Nothing comes. \n[19]It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. \n[20]A goodly length in times past, but lately \n[21]I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again. \n[22] \n[23]On my mother's side the Ardens \n[24]Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. \n[25]yet cannot love nor write it. \n[26]Will it restore my gift? \n[27]To the Palace at Whitehall. \n[28] \n[29]No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it. \n[30]I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. \n[31]When I have fifty pounds. \n[32] \n[33]Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover. \n[34]Romeo \n[35]It's for Henslowe. He paid me. \n[36]Ten pounds. \n[37]I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. \n[38]Done. \n[39]I have lost my gift. \n[40]Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? \n[41]You see? The consumptives plot against me. \"Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it.\" \n[42]I feel a scene coming on. \n[43]  \n[44]  \n[45]  \n[46]Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! \n[47] \n[48]Burbage? \n[49]Mr. Tilney \n[50]So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. \n[51]  \n[52]You have opened the playhouses? \n[53]But the plague \n[54]Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part. \n[55]Give me to drink mandragora. \n[56]Kit \n[57]Wonderful, wonderful. \n[58]I have. And chinks to show for it. \n[59]I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business. \n[60]I hear you have a new play for the Curtain. \n[61]I love your early work. \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\" \n[62]Good title. \n[63]Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know. \n[64]Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word. \n[65]Yes, that's good. Until he meets \n[66]Do you think? \n[67] \n[68]Mercutio\u0085good name. \n[69]I'm coming. \n[70]Good luck with yours, Kit. \n[71]This is a different one. \n[72]I did not. \n[73]Tomorrow \n[74] \n[75]Your name? \n[76]Take off your hat. \n[77]Where did you learn how to do that? \n[78]Wait there. \n[79]Let me see you. Take off your hat. \n[80] \n[81]Follow that boat! \n[82] \n[83]Really? \n[84]Do you know that house? \n[85]The actor \n[86]William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and playwright of the Rose. \n[87] \n[88]Master Plum! What business here? \n[89]I seek Master Thomas Kent. \n[90] \n[91](coming round form the \n[92] \n[93] \n[94] \n[95]Will Shakespeare! \n[96]The same, alas. \n[97]A lowly player. \n[98]Oh--I am him too! \n[99] \n[100]Oh my lady, my love! \n[101]You can bring them with a word. \n[102]  \n[103]We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. \n[104]Who are you, master? \n[105] \n[106] \n[107]We are about to embark on a great voyage. \n[108]You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go \n[109]We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona \n[110]Mercutio \n[111]Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again? \n[112] (he thrust a hand between \n[113]Master Henslowe, you have your actors. \n[114]Yes, I saw it. \n[115]Better fortune, boy. \n[116] \n[117]Oh. What is your name? \n[118]I have to get back. \n[119]Cut round him for now. \n[120]Romeo. \n[121]What? \n[122]Good \n[123] \n[124]Do you understand me? \n[125]He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? \n[126]  \n[127]Of course you have not! I have not written it! \n[128]Go once more! \n[129] \n[130] \n[131]There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: \"a plague on both your houses!\" \n[132] \n[133]Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. \n[134]Row your boat. \n[135]She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? \n[136]And break her heart and mine? \n[137]She loves me, Thomas! \n[138]No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? \n[139]Your aunt? \n[140]Like a sickness and its cure together. \n[141]Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. \n[142]Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! \n[143]Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. \n[144]Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? \n[145]Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! \n[146] \n[147]For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! \n[148] \n[149]Can you love a fool? \n[150] \n[151]I am. \n[152]It is strange to me, too. \n[153]There is. \n[154] \n[155]Well perhaps better than my first. \n[156]I must. Look-- how pale the window. \n[157]No, the morning rooster woke me. \n[158] \n[159] \n[160] \n[161]It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. \n[162]Yes\u0085yes\u0085er\u0085not quite right\u0085it is more let me \"Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\" \n[163] \n[164]I must. I must \n[165]Yes, some of it is speakable. \n[166](reading through VIOLA'S \n[167]\"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel?\" \n[168]\"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee.\" \n[169]\"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\" \n[170]Oh, but it is mine too! \n[171]\"My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep: \n[172](continuing the speech with \n[173]\"Stay but a little, I will come again.\" \n[174] \n[175]Ned\u0085I know\u0085I know \n[176]Oh \n[177]Ah \n[178]Thank you, Ned. \n[179]You are a gentleman. \n[180]Sunday\u0085it is Sunday. \n[181]I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies. \n[182]In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature. \n[183]You cannot! Not for the Queen herself! \n[184] \n[185]Then I will go with you. \n[186]I know how to fight! \n[187]Here we come at last, my lord! \n[188]Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! \n[189]Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches! \n[190]A man, my lord? \n[191]A theatre poet? \n[192]Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. \n[193]Fifty pounds! \n[194]What is this rabble?! \n[195]A literary feud. Quite normal. \n[196]Stay hid! \n[197]I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country. \n[198]Is this a tavern? \n[199]It is also a tavern. \n[200]It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink. \n[201] \n[202]By God, I wish I knew. \n[203]Oh\u0085what have I done? \n[204]It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me! \n[205]It is worse. I have killed a man. \n[206]Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. \n[207]He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. \n[208]My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. \n[209]I was the more deceived. \n[210]Now? \n[211]Oh, my love You ran from me before. \n[212]You cannot marry Wessex! \n[213]No\u0085no. \n[214] \n[215]but the Friar who married Romeo and Juliet \n[216]You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again. \n[217]I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. \n[218]And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. \n[219]And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills herself. \n[220]The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering. \n[221]There's a new scene \n[222] \n[223]\"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer\u0085\" \n[224]\"\u0085thou need'st not to be gone.\" \n[225]You are on my ground. \n[226]I am more than enough. \n[227]Absent friends! This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe! \n[228] \n[229] \n[230]How will it? \n[231] \n[232] (as the awful truth gets \n[233]Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. \n[234]What do we do now? \n[235]Go on. \n[236]How will it? \n[237]Courage man. The hurt cannot be much. \n[238]\"I am fortune's fool!\" \n[239]I am fortune's fool. \n[240]You are married? \n[241]If you be married, my gave is like to be my wedding bed. The implication of her silence fills the air. WILL does not move. \n[242]\"\u0085Farewell\u0085\" \n[243]\"Trust me, love, in my eyes so do you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. Adieu\" \n[244]\"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor. Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have A dram of poison--\" \n[245]\"I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\" \n[246]\"Eyes, look your last!

Those here who are unknown will have a chance to be known. \n[46]It won't cost you a penny! Auditions in half-an-hour! \n[47]Ralph Bashford!

When can I see pages? \n[54]It starts well, and then it's all long- faced about some Rosaline. Where's the comedy, Will. Where's the dog? Do you think it is funny? \n[55]We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster. \n[56]Very well. \n[57]Yes, but very well. \n[58]Nobody. The author. \n[59]It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it. \n[60]Is it? \n[61] \n[62]The one who came with your letter? \n[63]Juliet? You mean Ethel. \n[64]A sonnet? You mean a play. \n[65] \n[66] \n[67]Not with my props! \n[68]We need that for the balcony scene! \n[69] \n[70]I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business \n[71]The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end? \n[72]By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife! \n[73]Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles. \n[74]The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity! \n[75]Mr. Tilney, what is this? \n[76]What?! \n[77]Why so? \n[78]He's a woman! \n[79] \n[80] \n[81]\n[82]Will! \n[83]We'll be needing a Romeo \n[84]No, it will turn out well. \n[85]I don't know, it's a mystery. \n[86]Another little problem. \n[87]The show must \u0085 you know \n[88]Juliet does not come on for twenty pages.

It's a mystery. \n[90]Can we talk? \n[91] \n[92]it will be all right, madam. \n[93]Who are you? \n[94]Do you know it? \n[95] ", "Queen": "\n[1]Well played, Master Crab, I commend you. \n[2]Stand up straight, girl. \n[3]I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond. \n[4]What do you love so much? \n[5]Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love? \n[6] \n[7]And--? \n[8]Above Lord Wessex? \n[9] \n[10]But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true. \n[11]I thought you were here because you had none. \n[12] \n[13]Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion arises. I have not seen anything to settle it yet. So--the fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola's audience. Have her then, but you are a lordly fool. She has been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it. \n[14]Have a care with my name, you will wear it out. \n[15]The Queen of England does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you. \n[16]Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from you, Maser Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here. \n[17]There was a wager, I remember\u0085as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play? \n[18]Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to Greenwich, Come as yourself and we will speak some more. WILL bows deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The waves part for her. \n[19]Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon? \n[20]As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder. \n[21]  \n[22]Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA. \n[23] \n[24]Too late, too late.
