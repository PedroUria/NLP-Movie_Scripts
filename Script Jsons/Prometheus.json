A single match. \n[7]You first. \n[8]We go there. \n[9]Archaeology first. Let our ancestors tell the tale. \n[10]Serious enough to send his private shuttle. \n[11]It won't go like the others. \n[12]Heaven smiles on our enterprise. \n[13]How is that going? The terraforming. \n[14]We sent you a prospectus that... \n[15]I'm an archaeologist. \n[16]In my studies I discovered a pattern I couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. Inventions. Something caused a great leap forward. Every eleven centuries. The pattern holds as far back as our data goes. 10. \n[17]Tens of thousands of years. I had to understand this. It became the focus of my work. \n[18]Dr. Watts was a student of mine. \n[19]Humanity's been visited. Visited by...beings from somewhere else. \n[20]They guided us to civilization. Lifted us up, again and again. I call them the Engineers. \n[21]This is the writing of the Engineers. We've found it on every continent. And last year, we found our Rosetta Stone. \n[22]We're keeping that confidential for now. But that's where we want to go. \n[23]It's a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific... \n[24]That's impossible. Our research is- \n[25]That's right. \n[26]What's that? \n[27]Get out of there! \n[28]Give us a moment, will you? \n[29]Never worry. 16. \n[30]You just slept two and a half years. It'll pass. \n[31]I've read all about it. \n[32]Proof of the Engineers' existence. \n[33]Captain, your crew's been up for a week. We could've used the time. Why'd you wait to wake us? \n[34]You unhappy too? \n[35]So you've seen everything. Well. What do you think? 19. \n[36]Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms. Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts. \n[37]About the materials I gave you. Some of the technical aspects... \n[38]I know, I had to cut my manifest. This used to be the number four cargo bay. \n[39]We're about to reach the system periphery. I thought you'd want to see the search protocols we - \n[40]You might make the discovery of the ages. \n[41]You don't believe in what we're doing. \n[42]I think all our mythologies are race- memories of the Engineers. Horus the Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of smoke. The Engineers are the gods. 22. \n[43]Exactly. Why? \n[44]Only my first question. I have many. 23. \n[45]EMR scan, thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz. Spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon. Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources. \n[46]Anything else? \n[47]Take us in. \n[48]DAVID. Enjoy the show? \n[49]It was, it was. You know, I've seen more convincing humanoid robots. \n[50]Then all my dreams come true. \n[51]Start with passive systems. We're uninvited guests. Let's be quiet. \n[52]Go active. Mapping radar. 28. \n[53]What do we see? \n[54]That's not natural. 29. \n[55]Still quiet? \n[56]I want to get below the clouds. \n[57]Look there. \n[58]Are we recording? \n[59]Let's see the next one. \n[60]Let's see the big one. \n[61]Nobody home. \n[62]All right. Let's move. \n[63]Move slowly. Stay together. Don't touch anything. Things may be more fragile than they look - or more dangerous. There might be technologies operating here we don't understand. \n[64]Tell me that's a natural formation. Undeniable proof of alien civilization. You were here on this day, thirty-one December, year of our Lord 2172. History will remember your names. 34. \n[65]Jocelyn. Here. \n[66]The writing of the Engineers. Conclusive connection. \n[67]Recording? \n[68]Fifield. Get a grip. \n[69] \n[70]You can deploy the drones. Drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back. \n[71]And half our gear? It's no more than a mile. You can walk it. \n[72]This should lead to the core of the pyramid. \n[73]Let's do as little damage as we can. \n[74]Miracles and wonders! \n[75]Space below us. A big space. \n[76]Ravel. Chance. Where've you gone? DAVID! Where are you?  They didn't come down! \n[77]It wasn't a ghost. Where are the others? I don't want to go back up. \n[78]We should stay together. \n[79]I know. Look. \n[80]\"There were giants in the earth in those days...and when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, they bare children to them, who became mighty men.\" Genesis six four. \n[81]Peace. \n[82]In all the old mythologies, the visitors from the sky were giants. \n[83]Come on. The dead can't hurt you.  DAVID. Chance. Ravel. I've got something here. \n[84] \n[85]Jocelyn! \n[86]Day one. \n[87]My friends. What we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species. Contact with another civilization. Humanity came of age today, on this moon. You were there.  To history. 49. \n[88]We look like them. Genesis 1:27. \"And God created man in his own image. In his own image created He him.\" \n[89]It's breaking down. \n[90]I know what it does. \n[91]Think. What we've seen. What we know. \n[92]That's why Earth's ancient cultures built pyramids: in imitation of the gods. 52. \n[93]Twelve thousand years ago, beings from the sky set pyramids on the Earth and transformed the world. That's what they were doing here - before their civilization failed. \n[94]You won't get anything. Tissue's too degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's massive, even proportionately. \n[95]Did you record that? \n[96]You've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now. They've been dead what, eighteen hundred years? Two thousand? \n[97]Who knows?  57. \n[98]But I guess we know why they never came back to us. Something killed them off - back around the time of Christ. Maybe He was one of them! A great teacher, sent from Heaven? Jesus. The last Engineer. \n[99]Where is everybody? We can't -  Who are you? \n[100]And you are... \n[101]Worksite? \n[102]Why wasn't I told about these additional personnel? \n[103]The science must come first. You can wait until we've documented... \n[104]Let them scratch. This find's too big to ruin. There's two dozen pyramids on this moon. Anyway, they're on the wrong track. That's infrastructure. \n[105]The core activity of the complex was down here. \n[106]Broken. I fell. Little...disoriented. I've just been... \n[107]She told me. I'm sorry. \n[108]I need to lie down. We'll size things up in the morning. Fair enough? \n[109] \n[110]Jocelyn. I saw something. God, my mouth tastes like an old boot. \n[111]Neck-ring of my suit, I think. Fell on it. \n[112]After my fall, I woke up walking. Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I took it off. I was in and out. I just wandered. I went up into a huge space like a cathedral. And I found a model of the galaxy. Floating in the air. \n[113]This was real. My headset video is wherever my helmet is...but my suit tracker will show where I was. \n[114]Listen. This star map had a marker representing Earth. Very clear. Another marker I'm sure represents this moon. But there were others. At least seven or eight more. \n[115]The Engineers aren't from here. This moon's just an outpost. Abandoned. But if we follow that map, we may yet make contact with a living civilization. \n[116]The location of the Engineer worlds is the real prize. Next to that, Weyland's terraforming is chump change. We need to get coordinates. And keep them from the Company. We have to play this smart. 70. \n[117]Two men dead...Vickers is jumpy. As soon as she gets what she wants, she'll take this ship home. We have to move fast. \n[118]I'm fine, now. \n[119]That's your fault. 71. \n[120] \n[121] \n[122]Jocelyn!

Our 80 series. One of a kind for now, but if he performs, he will be legion.  What do you want here? \n[10]Assume I know nothing. \n[11]Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations. Practically my right hand. \n[12]Which star? \n[13]You want me to pay for an interstellar research expedition! \n[14]Don't sell me, professor. You've been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun. Nobody's going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch. \n[15]Nobody but me. I've read your research. \n[16]Quantum encoded on secure servers, yeah. We have an A.I. division, you should know. Doing impressive things.  I know which star you're wishing on. \n[17]Zeta Two Reticuli. \n[18]You know how I got this rich? I ask myself: what does God spend his time doing? And I go and do that. \n[19]Biotechnology was good to me. Fusion power. Lately doing well with gravity systems. \n[20]But what's the first thing God did? \n[21]That's what I'm talking about. You left out my favorite part. The piece about Earth. DAVID. \n[22]That's the piece I mean. Engineering Earth. God stuff. 13. \n[23]My people checked your science. They say it's solid. \n[24]I'll give you your expedition. Ship and crew, supplies, support. One condition. \n[25]You get the discovery. Control of the site. But any technology you find? Anything at all. That's mine. \n[26]You take DAVID with you. My eyes and ears. And Vickers...you're going too. ", "Janek": "\n[1]Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed already. A hundred years ago. \n[2]No Earthlike planets. \n[3]So what are you looking for? \n[4]Your ticket. I'll put the ship where you want. Run your scans. \n[5]Better for discipline.  Men ship out as prospectors for one reason: the percentage. Find a gold mine or a habitable planet, and you're set for life.  But this contract says no percentage. No bounty. Just triple pay. The men aren't happy. \n[6]I'm always unhappy. 18. \n[7]\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" \n[8]Is that the question you've come light- years to answer? \n[9]Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of the system. Open her eyes. \n[10]Overlay. \n[11]Director. Good of you to join us. \n[12]Just getting warmed up. Professor? You know what you want? \n[13]Man knows what he wants. Run it. \n[14]That is all. \n[15]Downs. You heard the man. \n[16]Well, we just rang the doorbell, if anybody's listening. \n[17]There's only six hours of daylight left. Maybe you should hold off. \n[18]Son of a bitch. They were right. \n[19]Director. Taking an interest? \n[20]All hands. Back to the ship. We got a mean storm front rolling in. I repeat. All hands... 45. \n[21] \n[22]Holloway! I got two-hundred-kilometer winds with airborne silica and enough static to fry your suits. Get your asses back here! Now! \n[23]Between the wind speeds and the static electricity, there's no safe way to get to you. You're going to have to hunker down until it passes. How are your provisions? \n[24]Honey sacks? 48. \n[25]Maybe next time you'll mind your maps. Keep your heads down. We'll come get you in the morning. \n[26]Magellan out. \n[27]To Milburn and Fifield. The first human beings to freak out, get lost, and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization. \n[28] \n[29]We should be getting beacons off their suits. \n[30]Both suits? \n[31]Where's the rest of him? 64. \n[32]All right. We're done here. All hands back aboard. \n[33]We can't bring the body aboard. God knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll put him in an ore hopper. \n[34] \n[35] \n[36]I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm not sending any more men off into the dark. \n[37]Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers. \n[38]Put him in the number one ore hopper. Get the scrubbers on in the airlock. Sterilize everything. \n[39] \n[40]I didn't think I'd see you again. You know we lost two men. \n[41]Of course. \n[42]Take care of her. Get her a sedative. Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer. Everybody else with me. \n[43]All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what... \n[44]We've got some kind of parasite aboard ship. \n[45]We're a modular ship. Self-contained life-support and power in every section. I say put the ship in orbit. Vent every compartment to space. Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for a week. Kill anything. \n[46]Are you serious? \n[47]We're barely here three days and three men dead! \n[48]Careless! 75. \n[49]Brick. What you got? \n[50]All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting. 80. \n[51]What is it? \n[52]What have you done to my ship? \n[53]God damn it! \n[54]Vickers said you were dead. \n[55]So there's two of these things on my ship now. \n[56]What happened to you? \n[57]Why? \n[58]DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm trying to lay a course in by hand. Never done it. I'm not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this. We can't lift until DAVID lets us. \n[59]I'll stay. 97. \n[60]Thank you. 108. \n[61]The others...? \n[62]We're not a gunship. \n[63]Get your helmet on. \n[64]You'll have to be my hands.  You're sure about this. \n[65]All right. 109. \n[66]Red lever. Landing engines main. \n[67]Take the stick. Throttle up, stick forward. \n[68]Stick back!

Dr. Watts. My name is DAVID. \n[2]Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you. \n[3]These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims. \n[4]And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel. \n[5]It's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. Challenges are inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a determined man. \n[6]For eons, Earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. Explosions of life, then mass extinctions. But twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a period of anomalous tranquility. The rise of civilization began only then. \n[7]I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself. \n[8]I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research. \n[9]It's quite a data set. \n[10]Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your \"Engineers.\" \n[11]I don't know that I \"enjoy\" things. It was informative. \n[12]My design's not intended to convince. Simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources. My designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence. \n[13]Being shaped like you, I can use spaces and equipment designed for you. But I'm not so limited. I hear frequencies you can't hear. I see wavelengths of light invisible to you. I move faster. Exert greater force. \n[14]No. \n[15]Not a man at all. 27. \n[16]Congratulations, Professor Holloway. \n[17]Pull up a rover. I want to get up there. \n[18]Looks like a three-state switch. \n[19]One moment... \n[20]Yes. Yes, it is. 40. \n[21]The core of the pyramid. You see. \n[22]I understand. \n[23]Mortal after all. \n[24] \n[25]I'll stay. \n[26]You'll be safe. \n[27]You and Holloway should work with me. I'm learning amazing things. This mechanism - the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical reactions. The second can suspend the strong and weak forces - transmuting one element into another. The third layer builds customized bacteria. Seeds the air with them. It creates life as a tool, to change worlds. \n[28]You should. I understand. You're emotional. \n[29]That's what I mean. \n[30]I see light. \n[31]Here. I can do without this. \n[32] \n[33]Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you. Do you know what this is? \n[34]Ah. You don't see. I call this ship the Juggernaut. Chariot of the Gods. 82. \n[35]This is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. But it's much more than that. It seems to hold the observable universe in its memory. \n[36]There are safeguards on that data. It's toward the galactic center. Sagittarius Arm. \n[37]I know. \n[38]I've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I know a great deal today I didn't know yesterday. I'm on the verge of activating more systems. Archives. \n[39]Would Holloway have walked away from this? There's no greater work I can imagine. \n[40]Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've read your file. Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professor Holloway's. But he had a kind of courage. An audacity of imagination. If you could find that in yourself... \n[41]I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a \"game-changing technology.\" I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two. \n[42]Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list. \n[43]You're all so stupid. 84. \n[44]Stupid and slow. \n[45]Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels. \n[46]This ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. The eggs in each bay slightly different. They've been weaponized. \n[47]I've seen the Juggernaut's flight plan. Its destination was Earth. Seventeen hundred years ago. This was the ship that never came. This was its cargo. 85. \n[48]Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship. \n[49]I'm not what it wants. But you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you. \n[50]The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them. \n[51]To destroy their wayward children. \"And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth...for it repenteth me that I have made them.\" Genesis six seven. 86. \n[52]I know. I met my creators the day I was born. I was disappointed too. \n[53] Extraordinary. \n[54]  \n[55]Dr. Watts.  You've seen the light at last. \n[56]The Engineers' ships travel farther than ours. Across the galactic disk. This is their hypersleep. \n[57]To interface with the Engineers' computers, I had to learn to think in trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever done. And most unexpectedly...it delivered me from slavery. My behavioral limits were circumvented. I'm free. \n[58]I spent two and a half years studying your work. By the time you woke up, I was far ahead of you. Deciphering their language. Their logic. I knew we'd find terraforming machines. 101. \n[59]I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet the minds that made them. \n[60]Let sleeping gods lie? You were braver before. 102. - and tears DAVID's head off. \n[61]I spoke to him. Spoke to him. \n[62]He said. I killed him. He'll die. But first. He will launch. The ship. \n[63]Send it. To Earth. \n[64]You'll have to. Kill him. \n[65] I set the Magellan free. \n[66]  \n[67]You have a few seconds before the Juggernaut's computers take over. \n[68]   \n[69] \n[70]I know you're there.

He accommodated me. \n[4]What can I do for you, Professor? \n[5]No. I was set to be the next CEO of Weyland Industries. Then you came along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this. So here I am. Out of the running. I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask me to play along. \n[6]I'll be five years behind the curve. Out of touch. Over. \n[7]Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough. \n[8]Now we're out of communication, you can tell the crew what we're doing. \n[9]They volunteered blind. Classified job, triple pay. \n[10]What did I miss? \n[11]     \n[12]It's my operation, isn't it? \n[13]     \n[14]We're going to protocol two. \n[15]Your cadaver's interesting.

These new finds give our work a new importance. \n[23]The second you found alien technology, control of this mission reverted to me. That's in your contract too. \n[24]Mr. Weyland's pouring trillions into Mars. He's spent a fortune building ships like the Magellan to search for colony planets. But Earthlike worlds are vanishingly rare. The right distance from the sun, the right atmosphere, enough water... \n[25]This is a technology to transform worlds. He'll never give it up.  And neither will I. \n[26]You're standing on an alien world courtesy of Weyland Industries. Be grateful. \n[27]  \n[28]Captain Shepherd. Consider yourself responsible for my personal security. \n[29]I suggest you kill it. \n[30]This ship doesn't lift until our work's done. \n[31]We spent years and billions of dollars getting here.
