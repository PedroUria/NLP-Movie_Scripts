Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of... smallness, inadequacy. \n[2]This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little... Larger than life. \n[3]He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century. \n[4]Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see -- \n[5]My research suggests that exposure to a high-energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life. \n[6]In six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass Earth's orbit.  A study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life -- \n[7]Give kids the chance to be stronger, healthier, less prone to -- \n[8]But I haven't fully explained my -- \n[9]You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain... \n[10] \n[11]You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee-- \n[12]Not at all. \n[13]You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or -- \n[14] \n[15]Hilarious. \n[16]Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works -- \n[17]We got what we wanted.  That's enough. \n[18]Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and -- \n[19] \n[20]I, uh, think I remember the number. \n[21]As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission -- \n[22]External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in -- \n[23]Youthful high spirits. \n[24]I'm sure he's matured since then. \n[25]When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do? \n[26]I had it at four. \n[27]Wow.  Fantastic. \n[28]Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this. \n[29]He's made a few changes. \n[30]Victor's better at these things. \n[31]Yes.  Yes it is. \n[32]The shields on the station should protect us. \n[33]Let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben. \n[34]Sure. \n[35]No...no...impossible.  It's...too fast. \n[36]The cloud is accelerating! \n[37]I don't know what happened. \n[38]We've got minutes until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort. \n[39]Ben's still out there -- \n[40]Ben, we need you back inside. \n[41]Ben.  This is serious.  Turn around. \n[42]Come on, Ben, come on... \n[43]Not until Ben is back inside! \n[44]Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.  \n[45]He's not responsive -- \n[46]How's she doing? \n[47]Blood panels show no irradiation. Good.  You'll step up this protocol, every -- \n[48]Sue...I want to tell you...I'm... \n[49]She's allergic to orchids.  Put that Amaryllis Apapathos by her bed.  The African lilies?  They're her favorites. \n[50]Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling? \n[51]I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers. \n[52]I should have done more, run more tests -- \n[53]Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect -- \n[54]What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor -- \n[55]He's smart, powerful, successful -- \n[56]Ben.  He'll give her the life she deserves.  She ended up with the right guy.  Things worked out for the best. \n[57]Are you alright? \n[58]Feeling better? \n[59]That's good.  That's uh...good. \n[60]I'm really happy for you and Victor. \n[61]I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- \n[62]Passion. \n[63]For science. \n[64]What?  What did I say? \n[65]I...I...I just wanted to -- \n[66]Uh, Sue...?  I can't. \n[67]Sue...look at your hands. \n[68]Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap. \n[69] \n[70]We have to find Ben. \n[71]Ben, are you there? \n[72]...Ben? \n[73]Ben did this. \n[74]He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one. \n[75]He's going home. \n[76]Look, we've got a friend out there in trouble.  We need to get to him before -- \n[77] \n[78]Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them. \n[79]You've been working out. \n[80]Uh, Sue? \n[81]Ben.  Are you okay? \n[82]         \n[83]I swear to you, I will do everything in my power until there is not a breath left in me: you are going to be Ben again. \n[84]We're not going public with this. We're scientists, not celebrities. \n[85]Uh, during our recent mission to the Von Doom space station, we were exposed to as yet-unidentified radioactive energy, most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun-- \n[86]Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde-- \n[87]Look, we went up to space to find a way to understand DNA, to cure disease, save lives.  Well, now it's our DNA, our disease, our lives on the line... Thank you.  No more questions. \n[88]I'm afraid so... \n[89]Any visitors while I was away? \n[90]We had a tough year. \n[91]Oh, it is. \n[92]That's what we're here to find out. \n[93]We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes... \n[94] \n[95]Victor!  What are you doing here? \n[96]Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage. \n[97]Victor wait... I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned -- \n[98]I ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort -- \n[99]Victor, if we could understand what happened to us -- \n[100]If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes. \n[101]No, just sit back.  We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck.  We need to find the source of your strength. \n[102]Okay, this might smart a little. \n[103] \n[104]Back it down, Johnny! \n[105]Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it. \n[106]Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal... \n[107]Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask -- \n[108]O-kay.  We'll skip that question. \n[109]Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you -- \n[110] \n[111]It's not \"invisibility\" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge. \n[112]Have you had any side-effects, from your powers? \n[113]You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better -- \n[114]I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when -- \n[115]Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or... \n[116]How's that coming -- whoa -- \n[117]What in the world would give me that idea? \n[118]I mean, you broke up with me, right? \n[119]No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door.  Ergo... \n[120]I think it was a little more complicated than -- \n[121]There were a lot of variables to consider -- \n[122]Sue...I just...I thought... \n[123]Our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us.  So they can transform like us, becoming invisible, changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame. \n[124]They're not costumes. \n[125]   \n[126]Nothing...nothing...nothing... \n[127]Of course...of course...the cloud... \n[128] \n[129]If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity -- \n[130] \n[131]Of course.  Of course. \n[132](preoccupied, mind \n[133]There's a system to it. \n[134]Wait!  Sue, don't touch tha-- \n[135]That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to -- \n[136]No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments. \n[137]BEN!  What?  What's going on!? \n[138]He talked me into it. \n[139]Ben!  Slow down a second and -- \n[140] \n[141]This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again. \n[142]You need to control yourself and think before you -- \n[143]A higher calling like getting girls and making money? \n[144]Victor, are you...are you okay? \n[145]What are you doing here? \n[146]But I'm not done with the machine -- \n[147]Mass-produced?  This isn't a toaster.  You have no idea how it works. \n[148]The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us... \n[149]Victor, please.  We need time to verify the data... We can't afford any mistakes -- there's only enough ions for two or three attempts. \n[150]  \n[151]He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- \n[152]Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- \n[153] \n[154]I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage -- \n[155]You were? \n[156]You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late? \n[157]Sue, you were right.  It wasn't complicated.  I just wasn't ready to be...to become... You can be a little intimidating. \n[158]You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted. \n[159]Why didn't you say something? \n[160]Ben -- \n[161]We're working as hard as we can -- \n[162]Come on, this is nothing. \n[163]Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe-- \n[164]I am looking.  That's why I can't make a mistake!  I've got to get it right, and it's not right yet!  We need to test this. \n[165]I'm OK.  Just go, go after him.  Stop him. \n[166]I can...make it work. \n[167]The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm -- \n[168]Oh god Ben.  Are you okay? You did it, you really did it... \n[169]Victor...?  What, what happened to you?  What did you do to your -- \n[170]Victor, this isn't the way to -- \n[171]Sue.  The only thing I ever knew without thinking was... I...love... \n[172]\n[173]Johnny.  SUPERNOVA. \n[174]Now. \n[175]Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration -- \n[176]Time for your lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...? Ben... \n[177]Well, we do have the suits... \n[178]Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings... \n[179]Sue, can I talk to you for a second? \n[180]I found a broken gasket, from space -- \n[181]If one of us were to wear it... \n[182]No more thinking, no more variables...

You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing. \n[6]See you round, Benny... \n[7]I'm Alicia, by the way. \n[8]I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in? \n[9]Relax, it's casual. \n[10]My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.

You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants... And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard...seen... Reed, look at me. \n[34]What?  What do you mean you -- \n[35]It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA. \n[36]Apparently I can disappear. \n[37]Johnny. \n[38]Stop it. \n[39]Open up Ben, we need to talk. \n[40]I think that thing is Ben. \n[41]Victor, are you feeling alright? \n[42]We need to find him. \n[43]Victor, I'm sorry I -- \n[44]What now?  Reed...?  What do we do? \n[45]Ben's out there.  Let's go get him. \n[46]What? \n[47]What...? Oh. \n[48]Shut up. \n[49]Any more ideas, Reed?  Maybe you should strip down next, see how it feels to have fifty people staring -- \n[50]Oh.  Well then... \n[51]\n[52]Johnny, slow down.  Let's think this through, a second. \n[53]We don't know much more than you do, at this point.  Which is why we will be going directly to the lab, where we can diagnose our symptoms and -- \n[54]Jimmy.  Good to see you again. \n[55]How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? \n[56]If it happened to him, then it could... \n[57]Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life? \n[58]    \n[59]Victor, your scar -- \n[60]I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to -- \n[61]Thank you, that's generous, but I think I should stay here.  With my brother.  Until we get a handle on this. \n[62]We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. \n[63]You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- \n[64]That's the temperature of the sun. \n[65]He cooked the equipment. \n[66]What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope? \n[67]Bruises...from the bridge? \n[68]I've had some headaches.  Migraines. \n[69]Excuse me? \n[70]Anger.  Rage.  Frustration. \n[71] \n[72]I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- \n[73]Are you kidding? \n[74]Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked. \n[75]I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? \n[76]No.  There weren't.  There was you. And me.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does. \n[77]Same old Reed.  Too much thinking... \n[78] \n[79]We're not taking them out.  Johnny, we need to stay here till we've stabilized. \n[80]What are you doing? \n[81] \n[82]But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...? \n[83]And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well. \n[84]You really need to get a janitor. \n[85]This must be what it looks like inside your head. \n[86]Sorry.  My fault.  I won't...touch anything. \n[87]You said it was urgent. \n[88] \n[89]He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before -- \n[90]If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us. \n[91]Please don't make this personal -- \n[92]Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready. \n[93]That's new... \n[94]Have you read these...?  From all over.  People want us to fight crimes... save their kids...solve their problems... ...when we can't even solve our own. \n[95]Reed.  How close are we to a cure? \n[96]We're not specimens, we're patients. This isn't just another science project to you, is it...? \n[97]He didn't. \n[98]What did he do to the uniform?! \n[99]Girl...?! \n[100]I'm driving. \n[101]You gave us names?  What are you, the \"face\" of the Fantastic Four now? \n[102]You two need a time-out. \n[103]Damn it, Johnny. \n[104]Ben!  Slow down... \n[105]He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- \n[106]Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- \n[107]No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. \n[108]Can I talk to you? \n[109]Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- \n[110]Better than your life.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  We are. \n[111]Every variable but yourself.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like -- \n[112]So clear it out.  Get out of your head.  Get out of here... \n[113]Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up. \n[114]Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous. \n[115]Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you. \n[116]I gave him twenty. \n[117]I didn't want that night to end. \n[118]I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted you to be that man. \n[119]When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. \n[120]That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed... I'm saying it now. \n[121] \n[122]That's my nose, genius... These are my lips. \n[123]Ben!  Stop it!  Or I'll stop it. \n[124]Johnny?  Did you see Ben? \n[125]Is that what you call it?  \"Real\"? \n[126]Johnny, slow down.  Think.

Thanks for the lesson, bro. \n[70]Not too much, but I will say that it's all weather and no leather.  Kind of Armani meets Astronaut. \n[71]I go by the Human Torch.  The ladies call me Torch. \n[72]Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl. \n[73]Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader. \n[74]That's it.  Just The Thing.  We would have gone with The Rock, but it was taken.  And \"Thing\" pretty much sums it up. \n[75]Actually, between us, I think he's got some problems staying rigid. \n[76]Dude.

You serious? \n[89]You talk to Reed and Sue about this? \n[90]Christmas come early!  Check it out! \n[91]Hey!  That's a prototype! \n[92]Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world. \n[93]At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project. \n[94]Look around, sis!  She's not here.

One more thing he's got. \n[7]What about his first born? \n[8]He knew about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down -- \n[9]Maybe you should think about yourself for once.  You always let this guy push you round -- \n[10]I know, I know.  I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which... \n[11]Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave? \n[12]Can't do it.  I cannot do it. \n[13]No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator. \n[14]They crashed it into a wall.  A flight simulator. \n[15]Five times. \n[16]This makes five. \n[17]I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them? \n[18]Isn't that your speech? \n[19]This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there. \n[20]I'll be watching over you. \n[21]Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock. \n[22]What the hell you smiling at?

Even you can't compute every little thing. \n[42]It was a freak of nature.  Last I checked, you don't have a crystal ball.  Let it go. \n[43]You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life. \n[44]Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie. \n[45]I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws? \n[46]Well maybe you should date him. \n[47]Do I have to do everything myself? \n[48]Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting. \n[49]Hey Reed, what are you doing here? Great, why don't you join us? \n[50]God, I'm starving.  Gonna hit the buffet. \n[51]Pardon me... \n[52]I think I need to lie down.

Take a good look, pal, how bad could it be? \n[70]Okay, easy there, buddy. \n[71]You had to choose my spot, didn't you? \n[72]This is really not my day. \n[73]A little help here?!
