He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years. Fairly good political connections. He's also trained most of their attack boat skippers. They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster. Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something captures his attention: \n[28]The doors, Admiral, are the problem. I don't know what they are and neither do the English. it's just pole our friends at the Ustinov Design Bureau have come up with something new. With your permission, I'd like to show these to someone. Do you know Skip Tyler? \n[29]  \n[30]Right now if it's OX with you?

What it that thing? \n[34]That's what a DSRV looks like. \n[35]What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision.

No, this is Dr. Ryan. Affright. He stares at Tyler quizzically, waiting: \n[44]Yes, Admiral, I'm --- \n[45]Yes, sir, but what's - \n[46]I got a line on the doors. You know what they are? Greer doesn't answer. Impatient, Ryan follows him into \n[47]       \n[48]Jesus... ! This is unbelievable. The Kirov, too. They've sortled their whale bloody fleet! \n[49]Where're we going anyway? \n[50]Who's giving the brieefing? \n[51]  \n[52]into the White House Briefing Room. Joint Chiefs are gathered around a thirty foot conference table. Greer introduces Ryan to a GENERAL and an ADMIRAL, then mingles. Left alone, Ryan spot, a lectern at the foot of the tabl. Nearby, a yeoman tends a slide machine, an overhead projector and a large bulletin board. Ryan heads for the lectern. The yeoman has a list of slides, some photos and mustrations. Trying to gather his thoughts, Ryan steps behind the lectern. \n[53]Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was -- this ship, the Red October. A variant of the typhoon class, she's some six hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement, roughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier. Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters, Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s, which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads. That's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in. We believe these doors on the bow, and here again on the stern, enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar, which may allow the sub to run totally silent. it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain, a man named Marko \n[54]to elude one of ' our attack boats, the Dallas, which trailed Red October f r om harbor this morning. This drive, if it's working, could render Red October invvsihl8 to our SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic. \n[55]There's no doubt about that, sir. She is designed to approach by stealth, and fire on a target with little or no warning. \n[56]Precisely, Admiral.. if I may continue. Shortly after the Dallas lost contact, there were additional Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have \n[57]That's her uncle! \n[58]  \n[59]This is the twenty-gird, isn't it? Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain: SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him. \n[60]Uhhmm...I was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider. Ryan takes a deep breath. \n[61]Ramius might be trying to defect. Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles: \n[62]Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer Corps. He'd be in a position to sect men willing to help him. And he's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth, and by heritage. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, who was a fisherman. He has no children, no ties to leave behind and - This morning was the first anniversary of his wife's death. \n[63]I know Ramins, General. He's. been a maverick for his entire career. I even met him once at an embassy dinner. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmet captain Ramius, sir? Have you ever The General darkens. Making a decision, Pelt turns to the Admiral: \n[64]It wasn't my intention, sir - \n[65]Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him. \n[66]      \n[67]  \n[68]dng hands) Jack Ryan, Admiral..

I'm not sure that --- \n[72]Can't remember. Every time I get. the chance, somebody puts me on another airplane. \n[73]  \n[74]brushing his teeth in the head adjacent to his stateroom on the Kennedy. Through an open door, his unmade bunk. Catching sight of himself in the mirror: \n[75]We'd have to get rid of the crew. How do you get the crew off a nuclear submarine? \n[76]Morning, Admiral. \n[77]Like the dead.  Our friends have been busy. \n[78]Could you get me aboard the Dallas? \n[79]  \n[80]  \n[81]Wait a minute! \n[82]Jesus Christ! I cant believe it! Jesus Christ --\u00c2\u00bb \n[83]When I hit the water, it was like Ice. I thought I was going to freeze -- \n[84]  \n[85]Captain, we have to find the Red October. She's a Russian -- \n[86] \n[87]I have to talk to - \n[88] \n[89]What do you mean battle stations? Look, I've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October. Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket: \n[90]  \n[91]Wail! Think about this a second. Naturally the Soviets would tall us he is insane. They want us to sink him before he has an opportunity to defect. \n[92]Listen to me, Captain. There must be some way you can establish contact without violating your orders. I'm telling you, he wants to defect. If there's ever going to be peace in the world somebody has to take a risk. Give the man a chance. He's defecting. I know it. Please. \n[93] \n[94]What does it mean? \n[95]American government told you intend to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach U.S. coast. Repeat. Do not approach U.S. coast, or you .w&gt;7 . be attacked. If you understand, ping once. He can do that, can't he? \n[96]  \n[97]Just send it. And ten him to ping again if he agrees. \n[98](to Mancuso,., \n[99]  \n[100]  \n[101]He's not going to change his mind. \n[102] \n[103]Russian Cigarette? Could I try one? Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS: \n[104]  \n[105]You have a good memory, Captain. We meet briefly years ago. But I'm not a naval commander. I work for the CIA. \n[106]Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm just an analyst. I write books. Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL: \n[107] \n[108] \n[109]  \n[110]Pardon? \n[111]  \n[112]What happened? \n[113]So we're safe? \n[114]  \n[115]Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here... \n[116]Sensitive stuff...in here ...I have to... be careful... of course. The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD: \n[117]I have to be careful what I shoot at.. He doesn't have to be careful... He can shoot at anything he wants. \n[118]Flame LEAPS from the BARREL of the .45. The pistol KICKS like a MULE. Loginov is delivered to eternity.

There is hope for your small brain yet. And like Mozart at Saltzburg, you have labored to produce... hiclocdc. \n[5]A whale, Beaumont. A whale.

Suddenly, \n[15]Don't know. \n[16]It disappeared, sir. \n[17]Running diagnostics, now, Captain. Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning, he stares blankly at Mancuso: \n[18]Sonar is working, sir. The Russian just disappeared. One minute he was steady four thousand yards off our bow and then he was gone. And r a second, I thought I heard... well ;-- \n[19]  \n[20]Jesus Christ. Somebody just stepped on the gas. Sonar contact, Captain. Very loud. Viktar Class Soviet submarine. Cutting big holes in the water. Bearing six- five-zero. \n[21]Jeez. There's another one. Bearing .,even-three. Hold on. There's two more out there. They're all in a hurry and don't care who the hell knows it. Have the Soviets scheduled submarine races today, sir? \n[22]working his tape recorder in the Dallas' sonar shack. Varying speeds, \u00e2\u0082\u00acftering extraneous noise, Jones is isolating the eer9e \n[23]at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter. \n[24]  \n[25]I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement. \n[26]Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines - \n[27]Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map: \n[28]The first contact was at zero-nine-Been hours and the bearing was two-six-nine. Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero. I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two. The last signal was real faint and I didn't have a very good lock on it. \n[29]Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern: \n[30]Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast. \n[31]  \n[32]Yes, sir.

Way over the ham. Your trout is so wrinkled it's about to faU off. \n[38]Speaking of which, what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head? \n[39]For many months, seaman Beaumont, there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew's head. it was community property. Then one day, it disappeared. The ..COB. here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished. \n[40]I have a theory, seaman Beaumont. I believe the CO B Is like a black widow, spider.

The counter-measure is MOVING AWAY. Waiting until. Stadnyuk has gone, Ramius turns to the Kamarov: \n[73]Bottom the damn ship! \n[74]This Is the Captain. The explosion you Just heard was the first operational test of a new counter-measure. The torpedo was launched by our friends in Soviet aviation. Borodin stares at Ramius: \n[75]Until now, orders required that I keep this aspect of our mission secret so that you might be evaluated under simulated battle conditions. Pump us off the bottom and engage the c\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtaerpa'T]ar. Nobody moves. Ramius is indomitable: \n[76]Diving officer, bring the ship to one hundred meters. \n[77]in a cramped tunnel beneath Red October's engineering compartment. Melekhin is holding a steel. pipe. Above, a piece of rope dangles from some gears. A slipknot has been tied on the loose end. \n[78] \n[79] We21. have to find a way to get the crew off this ship, now. We are in danger every second they are aboard. \n[80]in the Conn on Red October, surrounded by activity. Urgently, he speaks into a mike: \n[81]Sonar, this is Ramius. Can you identify the contact? \n[82]as before in Red. October's -Conn. The crew has come to battle stations. Borodin is at fire control.. \n[83]  \n[84] No. Lock the (ring solution into computer.

Borodin smiles at Ramius fondly: \n[89]I think they w91 let you live wherever you want, my find. \n[90]I said, keep your voice down. The \n[91]it's probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes. That happens. Now let's take' another sample. But quietly. We don't want to panic the crew. \n[92]Evacuate the compartment-' Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the compartment. Melekhin SCREAMS: \n[93]Get us to periscope depth.We ]i ventilate! \n[94]  \n[95]All right. Instruct the crew to secure the rafts to the deck. When all. personnel are aboard the rafts, we will scuttle the ship out from under us! \n[96]  \n[97]  \n[98]  \n[99]Doctor. When you get home. You will. hear many stories about me and some are true. But tell them that in the end I did my duty. Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it. \n[100]  \n[101]Gentlemen, I am Marko Ramius. I and my offers request political asylum in the United States. Before I go any further, I want to know whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan? \n[102]       \n[103] \n[104]Get back to engineering and give me some power! \n[105]No, Vasily. I need you in fire control.

Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly. CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP. Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on: \n[117]Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand. \n[118]  \n[119]Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits.

I designed this one. lt's aan d the Mystic. \n[6]Rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with British, German, other kinds of subs. This one here is designed to be super mobile. We can get it anywhere in the world in twenty-four hours. If that lunatic doesn't crash it fast:. Admiral Greer says you have some pdr ures.- - \n[7]high tech naval architecture. Technicians, graduate students move about in the background. Tyler is hunched over the Red October \n[8]Bigger than a regular typhoon. What are these doors? \n[9]Could. Question is why would you?

So it's' potentially very quiet. \n[14]Try silent If this works, we'll have to find a whole new way to track submarines. Ryan grapples with the implications. Tyler trips down memory lane: \n[15]We messed with it. Years ago. Never could make it work. They really built this? This isn't a mock-up or anything? \n[16] \n[17] ", "Painter": "\n[1]fifties, a man of puritanical integrity, takes a hit of the ooze in his quarters on the Kennedy.. KNOCK on the DOOR. Ryan and Davenport enter. \n[2]You want coffee? Something to eat? Alright:. What can I do.for you, son? You gonna tell me what all this activity is about? Ryan hands Painter a lettew. Opening It, Painter studies the contents. Davenport leans on a bulkhead, staring at Ryan. Painter returns the letter: \n[3]Can't get any higher authority than that. Now, what's going on? \n[4]For the sake of argument, let's assume you're right and Ramius intends to defect. What are you gonna do with the boat? You cant keep it. The Russians will. want it back. And theyRl know you've got it, :`because the crew wl]l tell them so. Or do you intend to keep them too? \n[5]  \n[6]Well, I agree with chuck on one thing, son. You've got your neck stretched way out there. Didn't Greer ever teach you the rules of survival in a bureaucracy?  Still, it would be nice to keep it. When's the last time you slept? \n[7]OK. Why don't you rack out fear a while. The chief outside will find you quarters. We'll be in CIC in the morning. It's gonna get real interesting out here the ' next couple of days. \n[8]When you shook hands with him, you notice the ring on his finger,, Chuck? Class of M.

Replete with lights, the status board reveals details of force deployment. Ryan enters, carrying copse: \n[11]Sleep well? \n[12]During the night, they positioned most of their front line submarines at barrier stations between Greenland and Iceland. Here, here and here. The majority of their Northern Fleet surface vessels are moving in a line abreast through here. It's an old anti submaxlne tactic. Like beaters in the jungle making a lot of noise, driving the prey into the guns of waiting hunters. One of our submarines, the Da71as, reports intermittent contact with Red October and is positioned here at the bottom of Red Route One. With luck, the Dallas will inte pt her. \n[13]We could fly you out there in a helicopter. But I don't think you'd like that much. \n[14]That's all there is, I'm afraid. Putting down his coffee cup, Ryan stares at the status board. A sal]ci r arrives with a message. Reading it, Painter glances at Ryan: \n[15]DaIlas found Red October and is backing her now.

Following him, Bonavia's stomach growls. \n[5]Has it occurred to you that Red October may already be in position? That Ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive? Waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself? \n[6]I will not break radio silence. We wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours. If Ramius hasn't arrived by then, I'll contact Red Fleet Command. \n[7]I Care little for your concerns, Comrade. Tupolev leaves. Bonavia glances at the quartermaster. His stomach growls again. \n[8]Mother of God. Down scope. Dive the ship. Saes in the Conn, prepare to dive. Tupalev is furious.
