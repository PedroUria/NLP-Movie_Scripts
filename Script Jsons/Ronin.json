And I coordinate. \n[8]Things.  This is my country, you know. \n[9]Of course. \n[10]And what is it you do? \n[11]Let's go for a ride. \n[12]To see a man about a thing. \n[13]Pretty much what you'd expect. \n[14] \n[15]Something like that... \n[16]I didn't know that you spoke French. \n[17]If you think we should. \n[18]I asked if we could give him anything else. \n[19]That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo? \n[20]Same thing, isn't it? \n[21]What's the difference? \n[22]Help yourself. Since when do you smoke? \n[23]A cigarette?  As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that? \n[24]Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse. It's just so damned pleasurable. \n[25] \n[26]Like Larry or Swede. \n[27]Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this. \n[28]So is the woman. \n[29]I wonder if she truly left the IRA. \n[30]I wanted to see who you were. \n[31]You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around. \n[32]They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something. \n[33]Lovely, isn't it? \n[34]Do you have it? \n[35]He's company. \n[36]What do you mean? \n[37]I just wanted to see something. \n[38]I needed to know. \n[39] \n[40] \n[41] \n[42]Where's my information? \n[43]Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be. \n[44]I needed to see if you were a cop. I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops... \n[45]How did you know? \n[46]That there was a gun pointed at me. \n[47]But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did? \n[48]You saved my life back there in the park. I know this doesn't begin to make it right between us... \n[49]I owe you a heavy debt. \n[50]We kept it... \n[51] \n[52]And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned. \n[53]Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is. What did we steal? \n[54]When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on. \n[55]And I don't believe you... \n[56] \n[57]Who do you think, Larry?  The IRA. \n[58]The question still remains: what do we do now? \n[59]You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... Including you... \n[60]You were smoking? \n[61](very sincere, offering the \n[62] \n[63]That was a bad bit of business, today. \n[64]A lot of people died. \n[65]I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it? \n[66]I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't. \n[67]I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun. \n[68]He's going north. That's Aix en Provence, where he used the phone. \n[69]Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore. \n[70]I hate to interrupt a conversation of such cultural depth... \n[71]...but we've got to get back on the road. \n[72]We've got him. \n[73]I know those men. \n[74]Don't even think it. \n[75]You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you. \n[76]Vienna. \n[77]That double-crossing bitch. \n[78]That makes twice now you've saved my life. \n[79]You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor. \n[80]No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital. \n[81]   \n[82]You're with Interpol -- you're a cop. \n[83]And what job is that? \n[84]It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group. \n[85]I'm going with you. \n[86]It isn't about money for me, not anymore. \n[87] \n[88]Hello, Jean-Pierre. \n[89] \n[90]Alright, it's done. \n[91]Clearly. \n[92] \n[93]Yes, Sam's tough alright. \n[94]Of course.  Don't you? \n[95](beat, trying to find a way to \n[96]How did you know? \n[97]I'm alright.  And you? \n[98]A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes. \n[99]I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new. \n[100]Do you have the tape? \n[101]You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape? \n[102] \n[103] \n[104]I get the picture. \n[105]Tony and I have to talk some business, first. \n[106]It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long. \n[107]Yes. \n[108]The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them. \n[109]If Tony says this is it, then it's it. \n[110]Tell me, Sam: why do you do this? \n[111]Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up. \n[112]Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam. \n[113]It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer. \n[114]Dark ops? \n[115]Very ugly. \n[116]Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all. \n[117]I know.  Jean-Pierre did. \n[118]I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to. \n[119]I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have. \n[120]Because I owe you. Look at that... \n[121] \n[122]You think? \n[123]What the fuck happened? \n[124]You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out. \n[125]Why didn't you kill her? \n[126] \n[127](slamming the dashboard in \n[128]You put everything on the line because you... \n[129]Fuck... \n[130]Left left left!!! \n[131]Right now? \n[132]  \n[133]We don't have much time. \n[134]  \n[135] \n[136]Something like that. \n[137]So I do it. \n[138]If our positions were reversed, would you leave me? \n[139]I think not. \n[140] \n[141]If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing. \n[142]Just like that? \n[143]  \n[144]Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that. \n[145]Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for. \n[146]Why not? \n[147]Closest and oldest. \n[148]And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it? \n[149]Do you have a good answer? \n[150]That's one less I owe you... \n[151]You have to stop doing that! \n[152]Finish the job... \n[153] \n[154]I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go out and get the bastard. \n[155]  \n[156]You son-of-a-bitch... \n[157]You speak French. \n[158] \n[159](repeating the Doctor's words \n[160] \n[161]Tell me something first. The package: what was it? \n[162]What happened to it? \n[163] \n[164]Sam, when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake, you could have killed the two of them with one shot.  You could have had the package, finished the job.  But you didn't, you sacrificed the job to save her life.  Why? \n[165]Would you just smoke already... \n[166]Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone. How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked. \n[167]So where do you go from here? \n[168]I'm up for that... \n[169]She's got a point. Besides, I know of a job that's available. \n[170] \n[171](a little louder, bordering \n[172](thrusting the cigarettes out to \n[173]Goodbye, Sam...

There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it. \n[4]It's been known to happen. \n[5] \n[6]Just testing, lass.  Forgive me, but I had to do it. \n[7] \n[8] \n[9](he's almost foaming at the \n[10]Ease up, man...I'm just checking to make sure you're on the level. \n[11]And it seems to me I saw a sign in there that says they got a late afternoon delivery.

Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together. \n[29]What's a little hate between business partners? \n[30]Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him. \n[31]It looks, Gentlemen, as if we're gonna have to sit down to table and work out an agreement. \n[32]I can't take it anymore.

You're the one did this to my face, are you? \n[35]Have a nice afterlife. \n[36]Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking bullet in his head! \n[37]Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can find that stinking Gregor, he's got the bloody package!

But the language he's speaking is universal. \n[28]I guess we oughta give them something... \n[29]  \n[30]What'd you say to him? \n[31] \n[32]Jujitsu. \n[33]Not at all.  Similar, but not the same. \n[34]One's a lot more painful than the other. \n[35]Could I get one of those? \n[36]  \n[37] \n[38]I do. \n[39](blowing a smoke ring with  \n[40]So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy. \n[41]Exactly.  Why not bring them? \n[42]Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is. \n[43]Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous. \n[44]I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me? \n[45]Who am I? \n[46]That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this. \n[47]Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless. \n[48]They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up. \n[49] \n[50](that edge creeping into his \n[51] \n[52](looking at Vincent, truly \n[53]You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent. \n[54]Now would be a good time to get the fuck out of here. \n[55]You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit. \n[56](insulted that Vincent would \n[57]Know what? \n[58]I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy. \n[59] \n[60]What I did back in the park I did because we're working together -- we're on the same team. This is business -- this is work.  We did it together, we share the spoils, even split. \n[61]Whatever you say. \n[62]Hazard pay... \n[63]We weren't real thrilled about it either... \n[64]  \n[65]I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed. \n[66]Is that right? \n[67]Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you. \n[68](returning the kiss, just as \n[69]   \n[70]No goodbye? \n[71]You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre. \n[72]You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me. \n[73]Duty calls? \n[74] \n[75] \n[76]  \n[77] \n[78] \n[79](continuing without missing a \n[80]Like it or now, we're on the same side: we're here and the package isn't. You're not the boss any more, you're our partner.  So tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this mess. \n[81]Now, what did we steal? \n[82]Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us. \n[83] \n[84] \n[85]Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think... \n[86]  \n[87] \n[88]  \n[89]  \n[90]   \n[91]  \n[92]What's going on? \n[93]I came up here to sneak a smoke. \n[94]I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table. \n[95] \n[96]I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own. \n[97]It was at that. \n[98]I've seen a lot of people die before. \n[99]You don't.  You just learn to live with it. \n[100]We live in a singular world, my friend. \n[101]You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits. \n[102] \n[103] \n[104]It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there. \n[105]   \n[106]  \n[107]Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when your partners come back out, you make sure you're here with the motor running. \n[108]After you, asshole. \n[109]You might have been one mean technical spook, Gregor, but you wouldn't have lasted a week in the field. \n[110]Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you. \n[111]Bullshit! \n[112]Then where is it? \n[113]Sent it where? \n[114]But you can't. \n[115]  \n[116]Hey... \n[117]I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit. \n[118] \n[119] \n[120]Not exactly. \n[121]If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do. \n[122]My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish. \n[123]We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me. \n[124]This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this. \n[125]You don't have to do this. \n[126]American. \n[127]  \n[128]Douse the wound with alcohol. \n[129] \n[130] \n[131]Peel back the skin and attach the clamp. \n[132]You see the bullet? \n[133]Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out. \n[134] \n[135]Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out. \n[136] \n[137]Soon. \n[138]Yeah. \n[139]It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them. \n[140]Vincent doesn't owe me a thing. \n[141]I didn't expect that he would. \n[142]Vincent told you that I'm a cop? \n[143]So this is what, a test? \n[144]If I was healthy, I could take that away from you. \n[145]So what is it you want to know? \n[146]Created? \n[147]Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai. \n[148]A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire. The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival. \n[149]  \n[150]  \n[151]What's the story? \n[152] \n[153]I'm sure. \n[154]Why's that? \n[155]It's the Irish tape we want. \n[156](repeating it, he knows this \n[157]I know of him. \n[158]The Irish representative? \n[159]What's this? \n[160]Thorough man. \n[161]You sure your friend got the right place? \n[162]Do what? \n[163]It's my job. \n[164]Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said. \n[165]I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops. \n[166]Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination. \n[167]It is at that. \n[168]I never made that claim. \n[169]You were behind the door? \n[170]You would have done that? \n[171] \n[172] \n[173] \n[174]You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him. They're going to get it. \n[175]Don't do it... \n[176]Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission? \n[177]Don't even think that I'm buying that. \n[178]I didn't say I was. \n[179]Don't even think it. \n[180]I'd kill you before you had it halfway out. \n[181]Put your seatbelt on. \n[182]I don't know... \n[183]Give me a cigarette. \n[184]Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!! \n[185]Nice place. \n[186]Business keeps you on the road? \n[187]I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it. \n[188]No you don't, and you know it. \n[189] \n[190]Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined. \n[191]   \n[192]Not here.  They might see it. \n[193]Time to quit. \n[194]Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette. \n[195] \n[196]  \n[197]Because I don't walk away. \n[198]It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not? \n[199]And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job. \n[200]That's a good question. \n[201](he's really just considering \n[202]I'm on point, Vincent. \n[203]Let's work our way through the building. I'll take one wing, you take the other. \n[204]Watch your back, Vincent. \n[205]Go on, them... \n[206]I'll work on it... \n[207]That's me. \n[208] \n[209]And now... \n[210]Deirdre, wait up -- \n[211]Are you alright? \n[212]I'm sorry, I can't allow that. \n[213]Call that number and ask them what you should do. \n[214]Thank you very much. \n[215]Here and there, I guess. \n[216]What? \n[217]What of it? \n[218]You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt. \n[219] \n[220]I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon. \n[221]Gone.  Destroyed. \n[222]It's what you would have done. \n[223]I told you, I quit. \n[224]Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. \n[225]How much does it pay? "}}
