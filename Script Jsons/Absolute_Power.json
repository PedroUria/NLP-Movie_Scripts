You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning. \n[57]Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there.

They were drunk. I hid in the vault. Sex got rough. He was going to kill Christy, but she turned the tables, was going to kill him. Two guys came in, shot her dead. \n[89]Probably only one of them. I think Walter Sullivan might have hired the other. \n[90]Not as powerful as the President of the United States. \n[91]Richmond was drunk. The two guys are Secret Service.
