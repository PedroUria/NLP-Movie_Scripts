Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model.  \n[2]\t\t\t...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.  \n[3]\t\t\tI'm sorry I'm late.  \n[4]\t\t\tDo you know how much information \t\t\tcan be dispensed in one minute alone?  \n[5]\t\t\tSo are you telling me everyone knew \t\t\tabout this get-together except you?  \n[6]\t\t\tPeople, you can attempt to pull a \t\t\tRodman like our friend Delacroix, \t\t\tbut I guarantee you'll be sent \t\t\tpacking just like him.  Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an overhead projector.  \n[7]\t\t\tThese are the standings.  Read 'em \t\t\tand weep.  As you can plainly see \t\t\tthe Continental Network System is \t\t\tlanguishing.  \n[8]\t\t\tLook at 'em people.  We are BOOTY, \t\t\tCA CA.  We are DOO-DOO.  Doo-doo on \t\t\ta stick, if you will.  \n[9]\t\t\tI do not like to be the laughing \t\t\tstock of the broadcast industry.  I \t\t\thave pride and people, you better \t\t\tstart getting some too.  These \t\t\tnumbers have to go up.  Dunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand.  \n[10]\t\t\tQuestion?  \n[11]\t\t\tWhat I want everyone to do is write \t\t\tsome material that is FUNNY.  The \t\t\tjunk you've been writing is about \t\t\tas funny as a dead baby.  It's not \t\t\tfunny, it's not new.  It's not sexy. \t\t\tIt, it, it...  \n[12]\t\t\tSUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This \t\t\tmeeting is over but I want everyone \t\t\tto seriously think about what I \t\t\tsaid and how you can deliver.  People scurry out.  \n[13]\t\t\tMonsieur Delacroix, in my office now.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.   \n[14] Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.  \n[15]\t\t\tDo you know what C.P. Time is?  \n[16]\t\t\tLet's sit down over there.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.   Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.  \n[17]\t\t\tI'm sorry about my blowup but I \t\t\thave to have a whipping boy every \t\t\tmeeting.  \n[18]\t\t\tForget it.  I believe you're my \t\t\tmost creative person I've got on \t\t\tstaff.  You're hip.  You know \t\t\twhat's happening.  I got some corny \t\t\twhite boys and girls writing for me.  Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it.  \n[19]\t\t\tI understand Black culture.  I grew \t\t\tup around black people all my life. \t\t\tIf the truth be told I probably \t\t\tknow \"niggers\" better than you, \t\t\tMonsieur Delacroix.  Please don't \t\t\tget offended by my use of the \t\t\tquote-unquote N word.  I got a \t\t\tblack wife and three bi-racial \t\t\tchildren, so I feel I have a right \t\t\tto use that word.  I don't give a \t\t\tdamn what Spike says, Tarantino is \t\t\tright.  Nigger is just a word.  If \t\t\tDirty Ole Bastard can use it every \t\t\tother word so can I.  \n[20]\n[21]\t\t\tThe material you've been creating \t\t\tis too white bread.  White people \t\t\twith black faces.  The Huxtable's, \t\t\tCosby, revolutionary.  But that's \t\t\tdead.  We can't go down that road \t\t\tagain.  \n[22]\t\t\tI'm telling you it's not.  He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window.  \n[23]\t\t\tThe middle class black family moves \t\t\tinto a white suburban enclave.  The \t\t\tmiddle class black family moves \t\t\tinto a small Southern town that is \t\t\trun by the KKK.  The middle class \t\t\tsingle black father raises his \t\t\tteenage daughter.  The middle class \t\t\tsingle black father raises his \t\t\tteenage daughter.  The middle class \t\t\tsingle black mother raises her \t\t\tteenage son.  And so on and so \t\t\tforth.  It's too clean, too \t\t\tantiseptic...  \n[24]\t\t\tDelacroix, wake up, brother man. \t\t\tThe reason why they didn't get \t\t\tpicked up was because nobody - and \t\t\tI mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers \t\t\talike wants to see that junk.  \n[25]\t\t\tYou got your head stuck up your ass \t\t\twith your Harvard education and \t\t\tyour pretentious ways.  Brother \t\t\tman, I'm blacker than you.  I'm \t\t\tkeepin' it real and you're frontin', \t\t\ttrying to be white.  \n[26]\t\t\tThat's exactly what I think.  I \t\t\twant you to create something that \t\t\tpeople want to see.  Let's be \t\t\thonest, the majority of the people \t\t\tin the country are deaf, dumb and \t\t\tblind and I'm including 35 million \t\t\tAfrican-Americans.  You know and I \t\t\tknow \"niggers\" set the trend, set \t\t\tthe styles.  This is a golden \t\t\topportunity now.  These idiots have \t\t\tto be led to the water.  \n[27]\t\t\tYou will or you'll be back at BET \t\t\tso quick you'll never know what hit \t\t\tyou.  I need a mid-season \t\t\treplacement and pronto.  It will be \t\t\ton the fast track.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  12.   \n[28]\t\t\tYes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show \t\t\tthat will make headlines, that will \t\t\thave millions and millions of \t\t\thouseholds tuned in, glued to their \t\t\ttelevisions every week.  I want \t\t\tadvertisers dying to buy on this \t\t\tshow.  I'm gonna squeeze this show \t\t\tout of you if it kills you.  \n[29] One by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the sofa.  \n[30]\t\t\tDelacroix, I'm glad you got your \t\t\tmind right.  \n[31]\t\t\tGood.  I like the names.  Very \t\t\ttheatrical.  \n[32]\t\t\tI'm wid it.  \n[33]\t\t\tGo on.  Good so far.  \n[34]\t\t\tWord!!!  \n[35]\t\t\tThe name of the show?  \n[36]\t\t\tI'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? \t\t\tBecause I'm getting a boner, my \t\t\tJohnson is hard, no disrespect my \t\t\tsister.  Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.  \n[37]\t\t\tI'm feelin' dis'!  \n[38]\t\t\tDon't worry about that, that's my \t\t\tdepartment.  Now who do we cast? \t\t\tWe need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or \t\t\tdance?  \n[39]\t\t\tAre these our two stars, sitting \t\t\there in front of my nose?  Which \t\t\tone is Mantan again?  \n[40]\t\t\tThat's a great handle.  \n[41]\t\t\tI want you take it there.  All the \t\t\tway to the edge and back.  Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.  \n[42]\t\t\tWhat are there character traits?  \n[43]\t\t\tExactly!  \n[44]\t\t\tAnd Sleep 'n Eat is his comical \t\t\tsidekick?  \n[45]\t\t\tThis could be bigger than \"Amos and \t\t\tAndy.\"  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  31.   \n[46]\t\t\tLet'em try.  I will kill to make \t\t\tthis happen.  Delacroix looks at Sloan.  \n[47]\t\t\tSo what.  We would just give the \t\t\tNAACP a donation that would be the \t\t\tend of that.  No such thing as bad \t\t\tpublicity.  So what.  Earlier you \t\t\tsaid singing and dancing.  \n[48]\t\t\tWho are the other characters?  \n[49]\t\t\tWe gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY \t\t\ton dis' one.  What's the setting?  \n[50]\t\t\tYa first bad move.  Projects been \t\t\tdone.  That's one of the problems \t\t\tnow, everything, movies, TV, are \t\t\tset in the urban jungle, da hood. \t\t\tThat's so tired.  Mantan's \t\t\tMillennium Minstrel Show should be \t\t\tset on a plantation.  In Alabama. \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  32.   \n[51]\t\t\tAnd every week these Alabama porch \t\t\tmonkeys will make us cry, make us \t\t\tlaugh, make us look at our own \t\t\thumanity.  Make us feel good to be \t\t\talive.  \n[52]\t\t\tWhat are you talkin' 'bout?  It's \t\t\tthe move.  Stay wid me now.  We're \t\t\tmovin' fast.  What does everybody \t\t\telse think about this?  \n[53]\t\t\tI like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's \t\t\tfunny.  Mantan, how do you feel \t\t\tabout performing in black face?  \n[54]\t\t\tShow me a little somethin' somethin'.  Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.  \n[55]\t\t\tDelacroix, you dug deep, deeper \t\t\tthan deep.  Mantan is ready.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  33.   \n[56]\t\t\tThat'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. \t\t\tThat'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's \t\t\toff the hiz-hook!  \n[57]\t\t\tSleep 'n Eat, what do you do?  \n[58]\t\t\tOh you do so?  \n[59]\t\t\tYou da man.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  34.   \n[60]\t\t\tI'm gonna run upstairs with this. \t\t\tIf CNS doesn't want to do this, \t\t\tsomebody else will have da balls to \t\t\tpull the trigger.  I want to thank \t\t\teach and every one of you.  This is \t\t\tgreat, Delacroix.  I'll get back to \t\t\tyou later today.  \n[61] \n[62]\t\t\tTo hire someone solely on their \t\t\tethnicity, gender or religion is \t\t\tnot right.  It's un-American.  I \t\t\twill hire someone who is most \t\t\tqualified for this particular job.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  45.   \n[63]\t\t\tI want a hot, young white director. \t\t\tMaybe the kid, that pheenom who \t\t\tjust did that hot new sexy Madonna \t\t\tvideo.  \n[64]\t\t\tI just want you to meet him.  Keep \t\t\tan open mind.  \n[65]\t\t\tProbably nuthin', but that's why \t\t\tit's such a sexy way to go. \t\t\tSometimes an outsider has a fresh \t\t\tnew outlook, a different unique \t\t\tperspective.  A black director, \t\t\ty'know what he's gonna do given the \t\t\tsubject matter?  With this kid, the \t\t\tpossibilities are endless.  \n[66]\t\t\tIf Spielburg can direct \"The Color \t\t\tPurple\" and \"Amistad\", our whiz kid \t\t\tcan direct the Mantan pilot.  \n[67]\t\t\tNo!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's \t\t\tall I'm asking.  Look, I'll even \t\t\tlet you choose your own musical \t\t\tdirector.  You can have that.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  46.   \n[68]\t\t\tDerrick Coleman, he possessed all \t\t\tthe talent in the world, coulda, \t\t\tshoulda, been a great ballplayer \t\t\tbut alas D.C. didn't want it bad \t\t\tenough.  Delacroix, do you want it? \t\t\tBad enough to kill for it?  Do you \t\t\twant it that much.  Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.  \n[69]\t\t\tDelacroix.  This is the director I \t\t\twas telling you about.  Jukka Laks.  \n[70]\t\t\tI'm gonna leave you two creative \t\t\tgeniuses alone.  \n[71] Delacroix charges in as Dunwitty and Jukka go over the same \"pink\" revisions.  \n[72]\t\t\tCalm down, please.  \n[73]\t\t\tWe just punched it up a bit.  Made \t\t\tit funnier.  \n[74]\t\t\tI seriously doubt that will ever \t\t\thappen.  Didn't I tell you I know \t\t\tyour people better than you do. \t\t\tBut if by some miracle you're \t\t\tcorrect, I'm gonna invite them \t\t\tinside my house and we'll have a \t\t\tsit down, discuss it like civil \t\t\thuman beings.  \n[75]\t\t\tI want you to meet my lovely wife \t\t\tVerna.  Honey, this is Pierre \t\t\tDelacroix and Sloan Hopkins.  \n[76]\t\t\tYo, DeLa, I just got the news from \t\t\tthe CNS brass.  They saw some clips \t\t\tfrom the pilot and they're rushing \t\t\tit onto the air.  Yo, we're a \t\t\tmidseason replacement, ordered 12 \t\t\tshows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya \t\t\thear what I just said, Yo?  \n[77] \n[78]\t\t\tThey didn't even view a rough cut, \t\t\tjust some scenes we quickly cut \t\t\ttogether.  \n[79]\t\t\tThe big mistake was my not believing \t\t\tin your genius earlier.  From the \t\t\tgitgo, from jump street.  \n[80]\t\t\tI want to meet her one day, please \t\t\ttell her the great news.  I'm OUT \t\t\tlike Vanilla Ice.  \n[81] Dunwitty, Delacroix and Sloan are joined by a young Caucasian woman, MYRNA GOLDFARB.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  87.   \n[82]\t\t\tI know all of you have seen the \t\t\tovernight ratings.  Through the \t\t\troof.  But in this game you gotta \t\t\tbe one, two, three steps ahead.  I \t\t\tintroduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. \t\t\tShe's the best media consultant in \t\t\tthe biz.  \n[83]\t\t\tMyrna is here to help us plan our \t\t\tstrategy.  \n[84]\t\t\tGoldfarb, run it down for them.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  88.   \n[85]\t\t\tWe all stick to this, it's smooth \t\t\tsailing.  \n[86]\t\t\tLet Myrna finish.  \n[87]\t\t\tYes you!  \n[88]\t\t\tYou couldn't hold out any longer, \t\t\thuh?  \n[89]\t\t\tStop the tape.  Stop the tape. \t\t\tDelacroix.  Get me Delacroix.  \n[90]\t\t\tDrop the curtain.  Drop the curtain.  Bunning drops the curtain.  Security rushes onto the stage and grabs Manray.  \n[91]\t\t\tEscort him out the building now!  \n[92]\t\t\tBut you are finished.  Done. \t\t\tNigga's like you are a dime a dozen. \t\t\tI'm gonna slide Honeycutt right \t\t\tinto ya spot.  We won't miss a step. \t\t\tGet him outta here.  The security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at Delacroix.  Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to the top.  \n[93]\t\t\tDeLa, I'll deal with you next.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 123.   \n[94]\t\t\tHello, my name is Thomas Dunwitty. \t\t\tI'm the Senior V.P. of the \t\t\tentertainment division here at CNS. \t\t\tI come to you with a heavy heart.  \n[95]\t\t\tThis abduction is a cowardly, vile, \t\t\tsinful and dastardly act and I \t\t\tpromise these creeps will be \t\t\tprosecuted to the fullest extent of \t\t\tthe law.  This is an attack on your \t\t\tAmerican way of life...  \n[96]\t\t\tWe here at CNS are offering a \t\t\t$100,000 cash award to any \t\t\tinformation that leads to the safe \t\t\treturn home of our dear friend, \t\t\tMantan.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 127.   \n[97] \n[98]\t\t\tHelp us and in addition you will \t\t\tget a guest-starring speaking role \t\t\ton the next Mantan - The New \t\t\tMillennium Minstrel Show, plus an \t\t\tadded bonus: a lifetime of Da Bomb \t\t\t125% Malt Liquor.  Let's you get ya \t\t\t\"freak on\", as well as a full \t\t\twardrobe of Timmi Hillnigger Active \t\t\tGit Toe Wear.  Mantan, may God \t\t\tbless you...  \n[99]", "Manray": "\n[1]\t\t\tWell do something about it.  \n[2]\t\t\tI'm starvin' like Marvin.  \n[3]\t\t\tHurry up, I wanna watch HBO.  \n[4]\t\t\tI guess that will come with the \t\t\trent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  13.   \n[5]\t\t\tYo, check it.  This is good and all \t\t\tthat but one day soon I want to \t\t\thave much Benjamins so I can have a \t\t\tnice crib and pay all my bills. \t\t\tYou hear me.  \n[6]\t\t\tAnd I'm the feet.  \n[7]\t\t\tI'm tired of waiting.  \n[8] They both are devouring the chicken with rice, as they watch bootleg HBO.  \n[9]\t\t\tMy tap shoes.  \n[10]\t\t\tWe ran out without my shoes and the \t\t\tfloor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What \t\t\tabout our savings?  \n[11]\t\t\tSloan!  She knows us.  The security guard stops.  \n[12]\t\t\tWe got evicted from our home. \t\t\tWe've both been on the streets for \t\t\tthe last week.  \n[13]\t\t\tIf it's not too much trouble could \t\t\tyou order us some food?  \n[14]\t\t\tWhat do I have to do?  \n[15]\t\t\tWhere do I sign?  \n[16]\t\t\tHow different?  \n[17]\t\t\tDeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get \t\t\tto hoof and get paid too!!!  \n[18]\t\t\tBet.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  23.   \n[19]\t\t\tTo what?  \n[20]\t\t\tMantan?  I don't even care as long \t\t\tas I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, \t\t\tI need some new kicks.  \n[21]\t\t\tI never had a really real pair \t\t\tbefore.  \n[22]\t\t\tNot a class, not a thing, just \t\t\tpicked stuff up by myself.  \n[23]\t\t\tYou sing and dance?  \n[24]\t\t\tSo what's up with you and DeLa?  \n[25]\t\t\tAre you and him kicking it? \t\t\tKnocking boots. \t\t\tY'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  24.   \n[26]\t\t\tI'm sure that was the only thing he \t\t\twas impressed with.  You look \t\t\tbeautiful like that.  \n[27]\t\t\tYou're welcome.  You shouldn't give \t\t\tup on performing.  \n[28]\t\t\tI think that would probably make \t\t\tyou the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, \t\t\tI mean really doing my thing, \t\t\thitting it, nothing compares to \t\t\tthat feeling in the world.  \n[29]\t\t\tHow do you do?  \n[30]\t\t\tWhy?  \n[31]\t\t\tDeLa, I don't know 'bout this.  \n[32]\t\t\tMantan?  \n[33]\t\t\tI'm not playin' myself no mo'.  \n[34]\t\t\tI won't do it anymore.  \n[35]\t\t\tI'm always gonna be that.  But I \t\t\tain't doing no more buck dancing.  \n[36]\t\t\tNo.  No.  Manray leads the way to the stage.  \n[37]\t\t\tCousins, I want all of you to go to \t\t\tyour windows.  Go to your windows \t\t\tand yell, scream with all the life \t\t\tyou can muster up inside your \t\t\tassaulted, bruised amd battered \t\t\tbodies.  \n[38] \n[39]\t\t\tI'm sick and tired of being a \t\t\tnigger and I'm not gonna take it \t\t\tanymore.  \n[40] He collapses onto the stage and the AUDIENCE sits on their hands.  Manray gets up and begins to dance.  \n[41]\t\t\tI wasn't finished doing my dance.  \n[42]\t\t\tWhaddup?  No one comes out.  \n[43]\t\t\tWhaddup?  The doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out.  \n[44]\t\t\tDon't start none, won't be none.  The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.  Manray tries to walk through them.  They block him.  Manray attempts to climb over the suburban.  He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle.  \n[45]\t\t\tWhat did I do?  \n[46] His face says he can't believe this is happening.  \n[47]\t\t\tFor singing and dancing?  \n[48]\t\t\tIf you're gonna kill me, kill me.  \n[49]\t\t\tThere is nothing you can do to me. \t\t\tI'm wearing the taps of Bill \t\t\t\"Bojangles\" Robinson.  Manray is shot in one foot.  Then the other.  \n[50] He dances like his life depends on it.  Despite the fact his feet are a bloody mess.

Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.  \n[17]\t\t\tFour minutes ago.  \n[18]\t\t\tI wasn't told about this until \t\t\tMarie informed me as soon as I got \t\t\toff the elevator.  All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.  \n[19]\t\t\tWhy didn't you tell me about this \t\t\tstaff meeting?  \n[20]\t\t\tWhat good are you if you don't tell \t\t\tme stuff like this?  \n[21]\t\t\tC.P. Time is Colored People's Time. \t\t\tThe stereotypical belief that \t\t\tNegroes are always late.  That \t\t\tNegroes have no sense of time - \t\t\ttime except when it comes to music \t\t\tor dance.  They both laugh.  \n[22]\t\t\tI understand.  But again, in all \t\t\thonesty I was not informed.  \n[23]\t\t\tI would prefer you not use that \t\t\tword in my presence.  \n[24]\t\t\tSay it again.  C'mon, say it again.  \n[25]\t\t\tWho's a nigger now?  POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.  \n[26]\t\t\tI don't agree.  The Negro middle \t\t\tclass does exist, and it's rich \t\t\tmaterial for a dramatic series or \t\t\tsitcom.  \n[27]\t\t\t...to white?  I still feel all of \t\t\tmy scripts would make good shows.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  11.   \n[28]\t\t\tI've never been given a fair shot.  \n[29]\t\t\tI'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I \t\t\tdon't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM \n[30]\t\t\tI'm not sure if I can deliver what \t\t\tyou want.  \n[31]\t\t\tWhat is it you want from me?  Some \t\t\tplantation follies?  Some sitcom \t\t\tthat takes place on a watermelon \t\t\tpatch?  Some show that follows four \t\t\tnigger generations of junkies and \t\t\tcrackheads?  You want me to go back \t\t\tto the ante bellum days?  \n[32] He sits in front of a large flat-screen television, watching the Yankee game and eating his takeout Chinese food.  On top of the monitor, he has attached a sign that reads \"FEED THE \n[33] Delacroix sits at his desk, a ream of white bond paper in front of him, a box of number-two pencils and an electric pencil sharpener.  \n[34]\t\t\tI was never good at performing \t\t\tunder the gun.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  14.   \n[35]\t\t\tWell, this wasn't a gun, it was a \t\t\tbazooka and it was pressed dead \t\t\tblank right against my dome.  \n[36] Delacroix grabs a pencil and put it to paper.  \n[37] Delacroix is already in the bed, the lights are out.  \n[38] \n[39]\n[40] The phone rings.  \n[41] Delacroix picks it up.  They yell in unison.  \n[42]\t\t\tManray!  \n[43]\t\t\tHow did you know?  \n[44]\t\t\tHow can this be?  You and me at the \t\t\tsame time, the exact same thought. \t\t\tIt's scary.  \n[45]\t\t\tManray was under our nose the whole \t\t\ttime.  \n[46]\t\t\tNot yet, but this thing will never \t\t\tget made.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  18.   \n[47]\t\t\tDunwitty wants a Coon show.  And \t\t\tthat's what I'm going to give him, \t\t\tit's going to be so racist, so \t\t\tnegative, he won't have the balls \t\t\tto put it on the air.  Hence I'll \t\t\tprove my point.  \n[48]\t\t\tThe point being that him, the \t\t\tnetworks don't want Black people on \t\t\ttelevision unless they are buffoons.  \n[49]\t\t\tYou getting cold feet?  \n[50]\t\t\tGood.  I'm going to need your \t\t\tsupport.  \n[51]\t\t\tAnd lose out on my money?  The only \t\t\tway I get paid is if I get fired. \t\t\tAnd that's what I intend to do.  \n[52]\t\t\tEverything was going according to \t\t\tplan.  I was working on the outline. \t\t\tDunwitty was off my back for now.  \n[53]\t\t\tBut there was a catch.  A big catch.  \n[54]\t\t\tManray and Cheeba were nowhere to \t\t\tbe found.  \n[55]\t\t\tIt was like they had disappeared \t\t\toff the face of the earth.  \n[56]\t\t\tI had no contact numbers, no \t\t\taddress, no beeper.  \n[57]\t\t\tNo nuthin', no clues...  \n[58]\t\t\tManray better not be bleeding to \t\t\tdeath.  I need him.  After we're \t\t\tdone he can do whatever he wants to \t\t\tdo, until then, he's ours.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  20.   \n[59] He sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old \"Amos 'n' Andy\" show.  Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in.  \n[60]\t\t\tEureka!  Where've you been?  He hugs them both.  \n[61]\t\t\tSloan and I have been looking all \t\t\tover for you.  \n[62]\t\t\tNo offense.  \n[63]\t\t\tI apologize.  What would you like \t\t\tto eat?  Anything you want.  \n[64] A feast of McDonald's is taking place.  Cheeba and Manray are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries into their mouths.  They were famished.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  22.   \n[65]\t\t\tI have this concept for a TV pilot. \t\t\tThere's no guarantee it will get \t\t\tmade but regardless, you'll still \t\t\tmake some money.  \n[66]\t\t\tFirst things first.  I have to know \t\t\tif Manray is up for this.  \n[67]\t\t\tSome tap dancing, some singing.  \n[68]\t\t\tDifferent.  \n[69]\t\t\tTrust me.  Of course I still have \t\t\tto pitch it to my boss, but we'll \t\t\thave an answer one way or the other.  \n[70]\t\t\tThat's right.  Money turns the wheel.  \n[71]\t\t\tYou'll both get an advance and you \t\t\tcan stay with me.  \n[72]\t\t\tI would like to change your name.  \n[73]\t\t\tYou're now Mantan.  \n[74]\t\t\tIt's right and tight.  Good morning, \t\t\tlet me introduce you to everybody. \t\t\tYou know my assistant, Sloan.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  28.   \n[75]\t\t\tThis is Cheeba.  \n[76]\t\t\tAnd this is Manray.  \n[77]\t\t\tWe're all happy to be here and I'm \t\t\tgoing to paint a picture for you.  \n[78]\t\t\tI've done a lot of soul searching \t\t\tand once again you are right.  In \t\t\tmy previous work it's been all \t\t\tsurface, superficial.  I have never \t\t\treally dug deep.  Not anymore.  As \t\t\tMark Twain fully understood satire \t\t\tis the way.  Race has always been a \t\t\thot button in this country's \t\t\thistory and it needs to be pushed \t\t\tharder.  If we are ever to live \t\t\tside by side in peace and harmony. \t\t\tIt's about promoting racial healing.  \n[79]\t\t\tI know you're familiar with minstrel \t\t\tshows.  They came about at the turn \t\t\tof the 19th century.  It was a \t\t\tvariety show in which the talent \t\t\twas in blackface - singing, dancing, \t\t\ttelling jokes, doing skits. \t\t\tDunwitty, I ask you when was the \t\t\tlast time there was a good variety \t\t\tshow on the air.  Carol Burnett? \t\t\tHeeHaw?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  29.   \n[80]\t\t\tSo let's take this great form, this \t\t\tvery American tradition of \t\t\tentertainment into the 21st century, \t\t\tinto the new millennium.  \n[81]\t\t\tIt is called: MANTAN - THE NEW \n[82]\t\t\tIt will take a lot of courage and \t\t\tbackbone on the part of the CNS to \t\t\tget this on the air.  In fact, I \t\t\twould understand fully if the \t\t\tsubject matter is deemed too \t\t\trisque, too controversial.  \n[83]\t\t\tI don't know if Whoopi is the way \t\t\tto go.  \n[84]\t\t\tAnd Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.  \n[85]\t\t\tMantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real \t\t\tcoons.  I know we're way out there \t\t\tbut it's satire.  \n[86]\t\t\tEvery week we follow the trials and \t\t\ttribulations of two real coons - \t\t\tMantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky \t\t\tDuo.  \n[87]\t\t\tIgnorant, dullwitted, lazy, and \t\t\tunlucky.  \n[88]\t\t\tMantan is an uneducated Negro who \t\t\talways by some stroke of \t\t\tunbelievable stupidity makes his \t\t\tbest laid plans go haywire.  \n[89]\t\t\tYep, you guessed it.  \n[90]\t\t\tProtest finally forced \"Amos and \t\t\tAndy\" off the air.  Could stop us \t\t\tfrom ever getting on.  \n[91]\t\t\tNegroes would be in an uproar.  \n[92]\t\t\tMantan right here is a gifted \t\t\thoofer.  He has educated feet.  \n[93]\t\t\tDo we have characters?  How about \t\t\tHoneycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, \t\t\tNigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, \t\t\tand how could we forget Aunt Jemima.  Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.  \n[94]\t\t\tIn the projects.  Like Eddie \t\t\tMurphy's \"The PJ's.\"  \n[95]\t\t\tI don't know about that plantation \t\t\tangle.  \n[96]\t\t\tWe think so.  \n[97] Delacroix sits with Manray and Cheeba in the living room.  \n[98]\t\t\tI want you to start using the name \t\t\tMantan and not Manray if you don't \t\t\tmind.  \n[99]\t\t\tYou have to start getting into your \t\t\tcharacter.  \n[100]\t\t\tThis is Mantan Moreland.  \n[101]\t\t\tHe was a clown, a buffoon but he \t\t\twas funny.  \n[102]\t\t\tGentlemen, the show, our show will \t\t\tbe satirical.  You know what that \t\t\tis, don't you?  Trust me on this one.  \n[103]\t\t\tThat can be done.  \n[104]\t\t\tMantan!!  \n[105]\t\t\tIt looks delicious.  \n[106]\t\t\tC'mon, Mommy, don't start with that \t\t\tI'm an ungrateful son stuff.  \n[107]\t\t\tCan't beat it with a hammer.  Well, \t\t\tsince you asked, it looks like I \t\t\tmay have a new show, a pilot being \t\t\tshot.  \n[108]\t\t\tIt was.  It is.  But this is a \t\t\tdifferent kind of show.  \n[109]\t\t\tMommy, please don't call me that.  \n[110]\t\t\tI know what's on my birth \t\t\tcertificate.  You heard from Daddy?  \n[111]\t\t\tTo answer your question, there are \t\t\ta lot of Negroes in it and what is \t\t\tyour definition of buffoons?  \n[112]\t\t\tPlease let me know when you hear \t\t\tfrom Daddy, get a number or \t\t\tsomething.  \n[113]\t\t\tI feel like somebody hit me upside \t\t\tda head with a sledgehammer.  \n[114]\t\t\tI'm happy for all of us.  It's just \t\t\twe have a great responsibility now. \t\t\tThe pressure is on.  \n[115]\t\t\tI didn't mean it to sound like that.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  41.   \n[116]\t\t\tNow I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because \t\t\tI didn't grow up on food stamps and \t\t\twelfare?  Because I didn't call \t\t\thome a cardboard box?  No, I never \t\t\tever went to bed hungry and I'm \t\t\tproud of it, too.  Whoever told you \t\t\tthat living in poverty earns you \t\t\tsomekind of badge of honor flat out \t\t\tlied to you.  \n[117]\t\t\tMy problem is MANTAN THE NEW \n[118]\t\t\tIt was the principle.  Dunwitty had \t\t\tto be enlightened.  I was making a \t\t\tpoint.  I take pride in my work. \t\t\tPlus, I already told you I wasn't \t\t\tgonna walk away from my money.  \n[119]\t\t\tEven if money wasn't an issue, \t\t\tDunwitty will still go ahead \t\t\twithout me and that could be more \t\t\tdangerous.  \n[120]\t\t\tI wouldn't bet against it.  My \t\t\tNegroidal ass is stuck between the \t\t\tproverbial rock and a hard place.  \n[121]\t\t\tI strongly feel that a Negro should \t\t\tdirect this.  This kind of satire \t\t\tis a high wire act in a gale storm. \t\t\tOne misstep and we're doing \"Amos \t\t\tand Andy.\"  Only a Negro will have \t\t\tthe sensitivity and cultural \t\t\tawareness to navigate this dangerous \t\t\tterrain.  \n[122]\t\t\tI was hoping to perhaps direct some \t\t\tepisodes myself, if not the pilot \t\t\tsoon after.  \n[123]\t\t\tYou're telling me some white boy is \t\t\tgonna direct this pilot?  \n[124]\t\t\tBesides, what does he know about \t\t\tNegroes?  \n[125]\t\t\tWhat are his qualifications besides \t\t\tbeing a white male and directing a \t\t\thot new sexy freaky Madonna video?  \n[126]\t\t\tThat's exactly my point.  Has he \t\t\teven directed actors before in \t\t\tanything?  \n[127]\t\t\tIn the immortal words of Derrick \t\t\tColeman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!  \n[128] All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female.  Every single last one.  \n[129]\t\t\tGood morning, for those of you who \t\t\tdon't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. \t\t\tI'm running things and this here is \t\t\tmy assistant Sloan Hopkins.  \n[130]\t\t\tI've never worked with any of you \t\t\tand you've never worked with me so \t\t\twe'll be starting from scratch. \t\t\tI'm a fair person, a straight \t\t\tshooter and I don't hold my tongue. \t\t\tEverybody up in here should know I \t\t\thad nothing to do with you being \t\t\thired. \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  47.   \n[131]\t\t\tI would have preferred at least one \t\t\tother Negro writer.  Any questions? \t\t\tComments?  MONA raises her hand.  \n[132]\t\t\tYes, your name?  \n[133]\t\t\tHi, Mona.  \n[134]\t\t\tOh, is that what I'm doing?  BETH jumps in.  \n[135]\t\t\tI've heard this somewhere before.  David raises his hand.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  48.   \n[136]\t\t\tThis thing was rigged, the deck was \t\t\tstacked, the fix was in.  Could Don \t\t\tKing be near?  Good thing Sloan had \t\t\tmy back.  She's my rock.  This was \t\t\tgoing to be a whole lot of work.  \n[137]\t\t\tDavid, I appreciate your comments. \t\t\tAnybody got an ideas?  Everybody \t\t\tjust talk out loud.  \n[138]\t\t\tThe mission was accomplished.  All \t\t\tof these people left the room \t\t\tthinking they would have real input. \t\t\tI was writing this pilot alone, \t\t\tmyself, me.  \n[139]\t\t\tNow came the fun part, finding the \t\t\ttalented performers to cast in the \t\t\tshow.  WE DOLLY past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed African American actors, many of them dressed in various costumes.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  50.   \n[140]\t\t\tEverybody and their mother was \t\t\ttrying to get in, trying to be seen. \t\t\tTrying to get their piece of the \t\t\trock.  \n[141]\t\t\tThis was amazing.  Who had told \t\t\tthese Negroes that this was what we \t\t\twere looking for?  The same old \t\t\timage, it damn for sure wasn't me.  \n[142]\t\t\tWere people this desperate to get \t\t\twork?  \n[143]\t\t\tThanks, Ms. Lulu.  \n[144]\t\t\tThat's good.  We've seen enough. \t\t\tWe'll get back to you.  Lulu scurries off stage.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  51.   \n[145]\t\t\tWhich one is your brother?  \n[146]\t\t\tWhat's your name?  \n[147]\t\t\tAnd what are the Mau-Mau's going to \t\t\tdo for us today?  \n[148] \n[149]\t\t\tWe're ready when you are.  \n[150] \n[151]\t\t\tGood.  We're really blacked-oops, \t\t\tbacked up, so shall we begin?  \n[152] A look of disbelief is on his face.  \n[153]\t\t\tNeedless to say, the Mau-Mau's did \t\t\tnot fit into our plans.  \n[154]\t\t\tAs I told Sloan, there's a black \t\t\tsheep in every family.  \n[155]\t\t\tFinland.  This is a travesty.  A \t\t\tdebacle.  A mockery.  \n[156]\t\t\tNice to meet you.  If you don't \t\t\tmind me asking you - how old are you?  \n[157]\t\t\tDunwitty, don't leave.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  54.   Dunwitty is out.  \n[158]\t\t\tWhere are you from?  \n[159]\t\t\tFinland.  \n[160]\t\t\tYes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever \t\t\tseen a Negro person before?  Even \t\t\thad a real conversation with a real \t\t\tNegro before?  \n[161]\t\t\tA fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. \t\t\tAn abomination.  \n[162]\t\t\tDid you just ask me what's a Negro? \n[163]\t\t\tWell before there was BLACK or \t\t\tAFRICAN AMERICAN, there were \n[164]\t\t\tHow did you get this gig?  \n[165]\t\t\tThis is a TV show, not a music video.  \n[166]\t\t\tThis is a travesty.  A debacle.  \n[167]\t\t\tI'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my \t\t\tthroat.  For the love of Joseph.  \n[168] He's sitting behind his desk, reading new \"pink\" revisions of the \"MANTAN\" pilot.  He screams.  \n[169]\t\t\tFor the love of Joseph and Mary.  Delacroix bolts out from his office.  \n[170]\t\t\tI will not be held responsible for \t\t\tthese revisions.  These changes are \t\t\tnot the way I want to go.  This is \t\t\tan outrage.  This is a sham.  A \t\t\tviolation!  \n[171]\t\t\tI don't give a good goddamn about \t\t\tFinland, Norway, Sweden or wherever \t\t\tya blond ass came from.  \n[172]\t\t\tFunnier to who and at who's expense? \t\t\tDunwitty, when Negroes start to run \t\t\tamok, the boycotts, when the \t\t\tdemostrations commence, I'm giving \t\t\tthem your home address.  Let's see \t\t\thow you like it when they picket \t\t\tyour lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.  \n[173]\t\t\tJust want to say good luck.  \n[174]\t\t\tWait a minute.  Hold up.  They all laugh.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  57.   \n[175]\t\t\tCan I kiss you too?  \n[176]\t\t\tYou feel good, not nervous?  \n[177]\t\t\tNot nervous?  Relaxed?  \n[178]\t\t\tFired up.  \n[179]\t\t\tThe material is fine.  Sloan cuts a look at this liar.  \n[180]\t\t\tWe're trying to do something new \t\t\there, some groundbreaking stuff.  \n[181]\t\t\tYour life will never be the same.  \n[182]\t\t\tWhat do you want me to say?  \n[183]\t\t\tGood luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.  \n[184]\t\t\tSame here.  \n[185]\t\t\tI guess it was divine inspiration.  \n[186]\t\t\tI was trying to be nice.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  60.   \n[187]\t\t\tC'mon.  You were only doing what \t\t\tfamily is supposed to be doing for \t\t\tfamily.  You gave your brother a \t\t\tshot.  That's all anybody can ask \t\t\tfor, an opportunity, a chance, a \t\t\tshot.  He got his.  \n[188] Delacroix looks like he has seen a ghost.  \n[189] Delacroix is in the same position as the scene before.  Face buried in his hands.  \n[190]\t\t\tHello?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  66.   \n[191] \n[192]\t\t\tThis has to be a big mistake.  \n[193]\t\t\tHold on a sec, I got a call.  \n[194]\t\t\tHello, Mommy, let me get rid of \t\t\tthis other call.  \n[195]\t\t\tI gots to go, it's my Moms.  \n[196] \n[197]\t\t\tI'll be right over.  \n[198]\t\t\tHe said that?  \n[199]\t\t\tWhere is he?  \n[200]\t\t\tI can't go all the way down south.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  68.   \n[201]\t\t\tI don't even know why you're still \t\t\tconcerned over him.  Daddy's not \t\t\twith you.  \n[202]\t\t\tIt's gonna be hard for me to get \t\t\taway with the show taking off.  \n[203]\t\t\tC'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been \t\t\timpressed with anything I've ever \t\t\tdone.  From winning my fifth grade \t\t\tSpelling Bee to the present.  \n[204]\t\t\tI figured this was a good time to \t\t\tget away.  Just jump in my ride and \t\t\tgo.  I always did my best thinking \t\t\twhen I was driving alone.  I needed \t\t\tto think out clearly what I was \t\t\tgoing to do with this MANTAN - THE \n[205] This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from \"Luke\" video.  \n[206] He looks around.  \n[207] It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty.  \n[208]\t\t\tBrother man, that's my father up \t\t\tthere and I drove a long way to see \t\t\thim perform.  Please take this \t\t\tfifty, go buy you and the young \t\t\tlady some drinks in the club.  The guy looks him up and down.  \n[209]\t\t\tI want to speak with you.  \n[210]\t\t\tIt's me, Peerless.  \n[211]\t\t\tIt's been a long time.  \n[212]\t\t\tPleased to meet you.  \n[213]\t\t\tIs that so?  \n[214]\t\t\tDaddy, she's younger than me.  \n[215]\t\t\tI thought you had promised Mommy \t\t\tyou stopped.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  73.   \n[216]\t\t\tHow did you end up here?  \n[217]\t\t\tThat's what I'm askin'.  \n[218]\t\t\tDaddy, it can't be just because of \t\t\tthat.  There had to be other factors.  Junebug pours himself another stiff one.  \n[219]\t\t\tAnother one of your conspiracies to \t\t\thold ya career back?  \n[220]\t\t\tThe same old, same old.  Trying to \t\t\tget my stuff through.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  74.   \n[221]\t\t\tNuthin' I can't handle.  \n[222]\t\t\tWhere do you go from here?  \n[223]\t\t\tI didn't mean that, in life.  \n[224]\t\t\tLet's get him over to the bed.  \n[225]\t\t\tI love you too, Daddy.  \n[226]\t\t\tHow long has my father been like \t\t\tthis?  \n[227]\t\t\tSo he drank himself into a stuper?  \n[228]\t\t\tSo what's up with you?  \n[229]\t\t\tDon't tell him it's from me or he \t\t\twon't take it.  \n[230]\t\t\tHe never showed it.  \n[231]\t\t\tMy Daddy.  I'm not mad at him.  Not \t\t\tat all.  Junebug was the reason I \t\t\tgot into this business in the first \t\t\tplace.  \n[232]\t\t\tAnd I thank him for that.  However, \t\t\tit did me no good seeing him in \t\t\tthat state.  Daddy was a broken man. \t\t\tHe had been a strong man, with \t\t\tconviction, integrity, principles \t\t\tand look where it had gotten him. \t\t\tI had to ask myself did I want to \t\t\tend up where he was?  \n[233]\t\t\tThat was the last time I ever saw \t\t\tmy father.  \n[234]\t\t\tWho's side are you on?  \n[235] He sits in front of the television, which is off.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  83.   \n[236]\t\t\tIt was the Day of Reckoning.  After \t\t\ta massive advertising and publicity \t\t\tcampaign...  \n[237]\t\t\t...the public would finally get a \t\t\tchance to view Mantan.  I was \t\t\tfeelin' a little bit like Dr. \t\t\tFrankenstein.  \n[238]\t\t\tWhat would their reaction be?  I \t\t\thadn't the foggiest.  \n[239]\t\t\tI was sunk, dead.  My goose was \t\t\tcooked.  The cat was in the bag and \t\t\tthe bag was in the river.  \n[240]\t\t\tWhy are you here?  \n[241]\t\t\tI thought it was the other way \t\t\taround.  \n[242]\t\t\tThese are black folks we're talkin' \t\t\tabout, not some lab mice in a cage.  \n[243]\t\t\tYeah, show dem pearly whites.  She ignores him.  \n[244]\t\t\tMe?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  89.   \n[245]\t\t\tI'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!!  \n[246]\t\t\tA small victory isn't that small \t\t\twhen you've been use to losing.  \n[247] Sloan hands Delacroix a wrapped gift.  \n[248]\t\t\tWhat is this?  \n[249]\t\t\tFor what?  \n[250]\t\t\tThe Jolly Nigger Bank.  \n[251]\t\t\tThanks.  \n[252]\t\t\tIs that good or bad?  \n[253]\t\t\tHow so?  \n[254]\t\t\tBecause race has always been a \t\t\tsensitive issue in this country. \t\t\tGary, I have no problem with people \t\t\tdisagreeing with the show, it's \t\t\twhen folks start trying to mess \t\t\twith my inherent right as an \t\t\tartist, that's when I get mad.  No \t\t\tone, in any way, shape or form \t\t\tshould be censored.  \n[255]\t\t\tYes.  And I say yes because who is \t\t\tto judge?  Who is to stand before \t\t\tus and say this is righteous and \t\t\tthis is not?  Who?  Who can play God?  \n[256]\t\t\tDon't you people get it?  We're in \t\t\tthe 21st Century.  Slavery was over \t\t\tfour hundred years ago.  All that \t\t\tstuff people talked in the old \t\t\tdays, it's over.  Folks always \t\t\tcrying, white man this, white man \t\t\tthat.  Let's all grow up.  \n[257]\t\t\tCan I finish?  Thank you.  I had a \t\t\tgreat Aunt, we called her Sister. \t\t\tShe went to her grave not believing \t\t\tman had walked on the Moon. \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  92.   \n[258]\t\t\tWhen I was a little kid, I would \t\t\targue with her, \"it's on TV.\"  She \t\t\twould answer \"I don't care what's \t\t\ton that idiot box.  No MAN is on \t\t\tthe MOON.\"  Well, there are a lot \t\t\tof your Negroes just like my Aunt \t\t\tSister.  Face up to it.  The world \t\t\thas changed and if you don't adapt, \t\t\tchange with it, you will be left \t\t\tbehind.  This show is a parody. \t\t\tAre you telling me that nobody can \t\t\tuse some humor, have some laughs in \t\t\ttheir lives?  Is that what you're \t\t\ttelling me?  \n[259]\t\t\tWhen American people want something, \t\t\tthey want it now, they want it big.  \n[260]\t\t\tThey wanted the hula hoop...  \n[261]\t\t\tThey wanted their yo-yo's.  \n[262]\t\t\tWho could ever forget those lovable \t\t\tpet rocks.  \n[263]\t\t\tBeanie Babies...  \n[264]\t\t\tNow the latest, hottest, newest \t\t\tsensation across the nation was...  \n[265]\n[266]\t\t\tIt was the rage.  \n[267]\t\t\tThe Mantan - The New Millennium \t\t\tMinstrel Show at www.nigger.com was \t\t\tgetting 500,000 hits a day.  \n[268] Delacroix has now decorated his entire office with Black Collectibles Art.  WE SEE black jockey lawn pieces, banks, mammies, signs for products, etc.  \n[269]\t\t\tSo they can be on TV.  \n[270]\t\t\tThis is nothing.  It will blow over \t\t\tby tomorrow.  \n[271]\t\t\tTomorrow it will be all about \t\t\tcruelty to animals or some sex \t\t\tscandal.  Besides, there is no such \t\t\tthing as bad publicity.  He hands Mantan a wrapped gift.  \n[272]\t\t\tRest your mind.  It's a little \t\t\tsomethin' something.  Mantan opens it.  He pulls out an old pair of tap shoes.  \n[273]\t\t\tThose were the last pair of tap \t\t\tshoes worn by Bill \"Bojangles\" \t\t\tRobinson.  In fact, he died with \t\t\tthem on.  Mantan starts to laugh.  \n[274]\t\t\tNo joke.  Serious.  \n[275]\t\t\tIn time.  \n[276]\t\t\tTo my astonishment, not only did \t\t\tthe people in TV land love us, but \t\t\talso the critics. _ \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 102.   \n[277] \n[278]\t\t\tMantan was being hailed as \t\t\tgroundbreaking, barrier breaking, \t\t\talso earth shaking.  I looked \t\t\tforward to my awards.  Just \t\t\tvindication for all my hard work, \t\t\tall my talent that had been \t\t\tpreviously overlooked.  \n[279]\t\t\tAlec Baldwin, this is the very \t\t\tfirst time we've ever met, you \t\t\tdon't know this, I'm your biggest \t\t\tfan and I want you to have my Emmy. \t\t\tIt's for you, out of the deep \t\t\tbowels of my heart - I don't \t\t\tdeserve this.  You take it.  Alec Baldwin is shocked.  He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug and they both cry like babies.  \n[280]\t\t\tIf I did that I'd be assured to \t\t\twork forever.  Delacroix the \t\t\tgrateful Negro.  \n[281]\t\t\tThat routine would go over like \t\t\tgangbusters.  I would be a dancing \t\t\tfool, Hollywood's new favorite \t\t\tNegro, move over Danny, Morgan, \t\t\tSamuel L., move over Whoopi.  \n[282]\t\t\tI had it all planned.  To the T.  \n[283]\t\t\tPull ya self together.  Mantan is distraught.  \n[284]\t\t\tWhat are you?  A man or a mouse? \t\t\tAre you a punk?  Punking out on me?  \n[285]\t\t\tYou getting scared because some \t\t\tpeople don't like what you are doing?  \n[286]\t\t\tYou've made it from the guttermost \t\t\tto the uppermost.  Don't you know \t\t\tyou should never let them see you \t\t\tsweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  \n[287]\t\t\tAnd now is definitely not the time \t\t\tto bitch up.  \n[288] Sloan turns off the TV.  \n[289]\t\t\tWhy'd you do that?  \n[290]\t\t\tHow long have you and Hambone been \t\t\thangin' out?  \n[291]\t\t\tThat crazy brother of yours doesn't \t\t\tthink so.  \n[292]\t\t\tOh, is he?  You getting jiggy with \t\t\tMantan?  \n[293]\t\t\tDunwitty and I feel you've been \t\t\tgetting too close to him, getting \t\t\this mind all messed up.  \n[294]\t\t\tDo you have to be so damn forthright?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 113.   \n[295]\t\t\tLight?  \n[296]\t\t\tYou can talk all that mumbo jumbo \t\t\tif you want to but your hands are \t\t\tmuch bloody.  I know where I made \t\t\tmy big mistake.  I have a general \t\t\trule, never get involved \t\t\tromantically with somebody crazier \t\t\tthan you.  \n[297]\t\t\tThis is crazy.  \n[298] \n[299]\t\t\tThe first and only time.  A big \t\t\tmistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you \t\t\tnot to see Mantan anymore.  \n[300]\t\t\tOtherwise.  I trust you know the \t\t\tdifference.  You're an intelligent \t\t\twoman, finished at NYU.  \n[301]\t\t\tAnd that's how you got me in the \t\t\tfirst place.  Sloan pulls a 3/4 inch cassette out of her bag and hands it to him.  \n[302]\t\t\tYou shouldn't even be mad at me \t\t\tover Sloan.  \n[303]\t\t\tOh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this \t\t\tbusiness if people don't produce, \t\t\tthey get fired.  \n[304]\t\t\tLet me ask you a question, if I may. \t\t\tHow do you think she got the job in \t\t\tthe first place?  I don't mean to \t\t\tburst your bubble, Mantan the \t\t\tMarvelous, but Sloan is an \t\t\topportunity.  \n[305]\t\t\tDo I have to spell it out for you? \t\t\tIn fact, go ask Sloan yourself.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 115.   \n[306] Delacroix sits behind the desk.  He's bought even more Black Collectibles, he's surrounded by them.  \n[307] He dials the phone.  \n[308]\t\t\tHello, Mommy, how are you?  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 117.   \n[309]\t\t\tYou going to attack me too.  The \t\t\tshow is a hit.  Aren't you happy \t\t\tfor me?  \n[310]\t\t\tYes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy \t\t\tcalled?  \n[311] \n[312]\t\t\tNot at all?  \n[313]\t\t\tIf and when he calls, please don't \t\t\tforget to ask him if he's seen \t\t\tMantan.  \n[314]\t\t\tSoon.  Delacroix hangs up the phone.  He takes out some change from his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly Nigger Bank.  \n[315] He is incredulous.  \n[316]\t\t\tWhen I thought or imagined that my \t\t\tfavorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an \t\t\tinanimate object, a piece of cold, \t\t\tcast iron, was moving by itself...  Delacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it off the table.  \n[317]\t\t\t...I knew I was getting paranoid. \t\t\tDid I really see what I saw or was \t\t\tI buggin'?  \n[318]\t\t\tDelacroix.  What?!  I'll be right \t\t\tdown.  Dunwitty looks at him.  \n[319]\t\t\tMantan, we got a show to tape.  \n[320]\t\t\tKook and the Gang, it's Manray. \t\t\tLet's do the taping.  You go back \t\t\tto your dressing room, get dressed \t\t\tand blacken up.  \n[321]\t\t\tHow you sound?  \n[322]\t\t\tManray, I'm very sorry about ya boy \t\t\tCheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it \t\t\tgave me no joy pulling ya coattail \t\t\tabout her, just lookin' out for a \t\t\tbrother.  I feel you, all this \t\t\tstuff happenin' at once but you \t\t\tcan't let if affect your work.  You \t\t\tgotta be professional.  \n[323]\t\t\tNo costume.  No blackface.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 121.   \n[324]\t\t\tAnd I should put my foot dead up in \t\t\tyo' ass.  \n[325]\t\t\tThe Mau-Mau's had come up with a \t\t\tbrilliant, sadistic plan to \t\t\tbroadcast Mantan's execution LIVE \t\t\tover the internet.  \n[326]\t\t\tThe Mau-Mau's sent anonymous e-mail \t\t\tproclamations to the websites of \t\t\tCNN, ABC, MSNBC and CBS.  It was an \t\t\tinvite to witness the Dance of \t\t\tDeath, 9 PM, prime time, tomorrow \t\t\tnight on a site to be designated at \t\t\ta later date.  \n[327]\t\t\tIt's no joke getting grilled by the \t\t\tFBI for five houts.  Delacroix SCREAMS.  \n[328]\t\t\tI don't know anything.  \n[329]\t\t\tSomehow, someway, somebody had \t\t\ttipped the sharks off.  It was a \t\t\tfeeding frenzy.  Delacroix and Cheeba start pushing people out of the way as they get in to their waiting car.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 126.   \n[330]\t\t\tThe X-Force was brought onto the \t\t\tcase.  When something involves the \t\t\tinternet, these are the people IBM, \t\t\tXEROX, the CIA, FBI, even the US \t\t\tGovernment go to.  \n[331]\t\t\tIt was a race against time.  The \t\t\tDance of Death.  \n[332] He's watching the same.  \n[333]\t\t\tThere oughta be a law...  \n[334]\t\t\tSWAT teams all up and down the East \t\t\tCoast busted in on known dissidents \t\t\tlooking for Manray.  All the tips \t\t\tcalled in, info gathered through \t\t\tsurveillance proved for naught.  \n[335]\t\t\tThank you for your help.  \n[336] He sits in front of his GIANT SCREEN, on the desk in front of him is the 3/4 inch cassette Sloan gave him.  He picks it up and turns it on.  \n[337]\t\t\tIt was ten o'clock and the Dance of \t\t\tDeath was about to commence.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 129.   \n[338]\t\t\tSince a lot of people still didn't \t\t\thave computers, the networks sought \t\t\ta court order to carry it live, \t\t\ttaking the feed off the internet. \t\t\tIt was granted.  A life snuff \t\t\tbroadcast right into your living \t\t\troom.  \n[339] \n[340]\t\t\tI had to give it to the Mau-Mau', \t\t\tthey definitely had a sense of \t\t\tirony.  They chose www.nigger.com \t\t\tas the website to pirate.  \n[341]\n[342] He screams at the monitor.  \n[343]\t\t\tDon't dance.  Don't do it.  \n[344] Delacroix's head is on his desk.  He has been crying.  On cue the Black Collectibles start to move.  The Jolly Nigger Bank, Aunt Jemima's, Mammies, etc., they are animated for \n[345] His head pops up as he sees the objects.  He too is in BLACKFACE.  In a rage, he starts to throw them against the wall.  \n[346]\t\t\tLeave me alone.  Get away from me. \t\t\tYou spearchucker.  You black sambo. \t\t\tYou nigger pickaninny.  Fat Mammie.  Delacroix has finally lost it.  He looks at the shambles he's made of his office.  \n[347] Delacroix is on the floor when the doorknob turns.  It's Sloan and she has a gun in one hand and her inhaler in the other.  She's wheezing like mad.  \n[348]\t\t\tI didn't think this was in your \t\t\tstudies at NYU.  Delacroix hits the PLAY button.  \n[349]\t\t\tI'm sorry.  I didn't know anyone \t\t\twould get hurt.  I'm sorry, please \t\t\tgive me that gun before you hurt \t\t\tyourself.  Give me the gun.  He reaches for it.  BOOM!  Sloan screams.  \n[350]\t\t\tGive me the gun.  She reluctantly hands it to him.  \n[351]\t\t\tGo, get out of here.  Go home.  Sloan runs out.  Delacroix slumps to the floor, WIPES HER FINGERPRINTS off the revolver.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 134.   \n[352] He looks at the monitor, the tape still playing.  \n[353]\t\t\tAs I bled to death, as my very \t\t\tprecious life oozed out of me all I \t\t\tcould think of was that I never \t\t\tmade my father proud.  My mother \t\t\tdidn't count.  \n[354]\t\t\tEverything I did, no matter how \t\t\tgreat or small, was always \t\t\textraordinary to her.  With Daddy \t\t\tit was a different ball game.  He \t\t\tnever saw me.  Pierre Delacroix.  \n[355] A pool of blood has formed around his dying body.  \n[356]\t\t\tNow it was time to buy the farm, \t\t\tfor me to meet my maker.  Goodbye \t\t\tcousins, and please tune in next \t\t\tweek for the Best of Mantan - The \t\t\tNew Millennium Minstrel Show.  \n[357] He looks at Mantan.  \n[358]\t\t\tFor the love of Joseph and Mary, \t\t\twhat have I done?  My God, what \t\t\thave I done?!  Delacroix slumps over dead.  ", "Honeycutt": "\n[1]\t\t\tEverybody say Ho!  \n[2]\t\t\tThat'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! \t\t\tThat'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!

Even the lost souls \t\t\twho don't know it are niggas cuz \t\t\tniggas is a beautiful thing.  \n[33]\t\t\tWe apologize for the holdup but \t\t\twithout further delay, ladies and \t\t\tgentlemen, boys and girls, let's \t\t\tgive it up for Mantan.  \n[34]\t\t\tC'mon, don't be niggardly, give it \t\t\tup.  Show Mantan some love.  The CURTAIN RISES and MANRAY stands before them in his regular street clothes and NO BLACK FACE.  ", "Junebug": "\n[1] He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often.  \n[2] \n[3]\t\t\t'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please \t\t\tshow me some respect.  I'm up here \t\t\ttrying to make a living.  \n[4]\t\t\tDon't make me have to come over \t\t\tthere and whoop you upside ya head.  The sparse AUDIENCE laughs.  \n[5]\t\t\tJust messin' with ya.  But please \t\t\tif you and your lady need to \t\t\tdiscuss something, take it outside. \t\t\tThank you.  He continues on with his show.  \n[6] \n[7]\t\t\tDon't bring your woman out if you \t\t\tcan't keep her in deep check.  If \t\t\tmy woman ever did something crazy \t\t\tlike that I'd put my size 12 dead \t\t\tup in her ass.  This gets the biggest laugh of the night.  \n[8]\t\t\tWhat do you want?  \n[9]\t\t\tGo away, unless you got my money.  \n[10]\t\t\tSon.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.  \n[11]\t\t\tPull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, \t\t\tthis is my lady DOT.  \n[12]\t\t\tHoney, pour me and my son a drink.  They both sit down as drinks are poured.  \n[13]\t\t\tGood woman.  I trained her right.  \n[14]\t\t\tMy game is still strong.  No Viagra \t\t\tfor me, don't need no chemicals. \t\t\tJust my tonic.  He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp.  \n[15]\t\t\tPurely for medicinal purposes.  \n[16]\t\t\tI did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I \t\t\tjust like to drink.  \n[17]\t\t\tHow did I end up at the third rate \t\t\tchittlin' circuit greasy hole in \t\t\tthe wall in West Hell, Virginny? \t\t\tIs that what you're asking ya Daddy?  Delacroix takes a sip of his drink.  \n[18]\t\t\tBecause I had too much pride.  Too \t\t\tmuch integrity.  I wouldn't lick \t\t\tnobody's butt.  Some material I \t\t\trefused to do.  \n[19]\t\t\tThat's the only reason, period. \t\t\tThey only want one certain kind of \t\t\tblack comic.  \n[20]\t\t\tAll I know is what happened to me. \t\t\tAll that other mess I just file \t\t\tinto the \"life's too short\" category.  He downs another one.  Junebug drinks like a fish.  \n[21]\t\t\tEnough about me, what's happening \t\t\twith you?  \n[22]\t\t\tDem white boys giving you a hard \t\t\ttime?  \n[23]\t\t\tThe truth is never let them seeya \t\t\tsweat.  You do that, that's half \t\t\tthe battle.  \n[24]\t\t\tThree nights Charleston, South \t\t\tCarolina.  \n[25]\t\t\tIn life?  I'ma keep on living, \t\t\thaving a good drink, got me a good \t\t\tyoung woman, make a couple of \t\t\tdollars and make people laugh. \t\t\tHaven't I always tol' you all \t\t\tnigga's are entertainers?  The \t\t\tquestion is what are you gonna do, \t\t\tPeerless?  \n[26]\t\t\tI'm not an alcoholic.  I just like \t\t\tto drink.  \n[27]\t\t\tBaby, you treat me so good. \t\t\tPeerless, you're a good son, I love \t\t\tyou.  You never gave me no trouble.  They lay him down on the bed.  \n[28]\t\t\tAlways keep 'em laughing.  Dot takes off his shoes.  He's out like a light.  Gone.  \n[29]", "Orchid": "\n[1]\t\t\tYou must think I'm some kind of fool.  \n[2]\t\t\tYou hear me talkin' to you.  The \t\t\tonly time you come up here when \t\t\tsomething is wrong.  \n[3]\t\t\tI said no such thing.  All I said \t\t\tis that something must be wrong.  She sits down with him.  \n[4]\t\t\tHow's the food?  \n[5]\t\t\tThat's wonderful.  Isn't that what \t\t\tyou always wanted, a show of your \t\t\town?  He talks between mouthfuls.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  39.   \n[6]\t\t\tIf at first it's not what you want, \t\t\tjust work that much harder, Peerless.  \n[7]\t\t\tSon, Peerless is your name.  Now \t\t\tyou might be one of these Hollywood \t\t\ttypes, change your name and all \t\t\tthat but Peerless Dothan is on your \t\t\tbirth certificate.  \n[8]\t\t\tI guess he's still on the road. \t\t\tWhat kind of show is this?  Are \t\t\tthey some Negroes in it without \t\t\tbeing buffoons?  \n[9]\t\t\tPeerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. \t\t\tWe have enough of those on \t\t\ttelevision already.  \n[10]\t\t\tI will.  And good luck with your \t\t\tshow.  I hope it's a huge success. \t\t\tYou've worked very hard.  You \t\t\tdeserve it.  Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  40.   \n[11] She is on the phone with her son.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  67.   \n[12]\t\t\tPeerless, your father called.  \n[13] Delacroix sits at the kitchen table.  \n[14]\t\t\tHe wants you to come and see him.  \n[15]\t\t\tYes he did.  \n[16]\t\t\tHe's performing at some place \t\t\toutside of Richmond, Virginia.  \n[17]\t\t\tRichmond is not all the way down \t\t\tsouth.  \n[18]\t\t\tRegardless, he still is your father.  \n[19]\t\t\tEven more reason to see him.  He'll \t\t\tbe overjoyed with your success.  \n[20]\t\t\tPeerless, last time, go see your \t\t\tfather.  \n[21]\t\t\tI'm doing okay.  Been reading about \t\t\tyour show, it's all over everywhere. \t\t\tI watched it's all over everywhere. \t\t\tI watched it once.  I thought you \t\t\tsaid there would be no buffoonery.  \n[22] \n[23]\t\t\tOf course I'm happy for you. \t\t\tYou've worked very hard for your \t\t\tsuccess.  \n[24]\t\t\tNo.  \n[25]\t\t\tYou know how your Daddy is.  \n[26]\t\t\tI won't forget.

He was excited to \t\t\tsee you.  \n[5]\t\t\tThe drinking is for the pain.  It \t\t\tdoesn't kill it, just dulls it.  \n[6]\t\t\tI was a hostess at this club, your \t\t\tDaddy was performing and I had \t\t\tnever laughed so hard in my life. \t\t\tHe asked me to come with him.  I \t\t\tquit my job and we've been together \t\t\tever since.
