I've done a lot of things in my life, worked very hard, but being here, looking around-- at all these shining, radiant faces, I know that my best work is right here in this room, right now... I'm deeply proud of all of you. That's the best gift your mother and I could have hoped for, so, thank you... \n[22] \n[23]Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too! \n[24]Now, I'm aware that may seem uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me sixty years to realize what's truly important -- and it's you guys so thank you all very much. \n[25]Kids are wild. \n[26]No, no no, you should have-- I want more \"you's\" around. \n[27]Yeah, yeah yeah... \n[28]What? \n[29] \n[30] Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can. \n[31] Well, you gonna keep skirting around it? \n[32]My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view. \n[33] \n[34] \n[35]Office. \n[36]Yeah I gotta finish up that thing. \n[37] \n[38] Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay? \n[39]Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late.  It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you. \n[40]The show's gonna be beautiful. \n[41](slight beat, then \n[42] \n[43]You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very... \n[44]I'm here. \n[45]Jeffrey, I told you, I'm... \n[46] \n[47]What do you want me to say? \n[48]I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly. \n[49]As soon as they sign the contract. \n[50]...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!... \n[51]You were a friend of mine!... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 13. \n[52](stands, heading to door \n[53] \n[54]...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again? \n[55] Not your fuckin problem... \n[56]  \n[57] \n[58] \n[59] Good. Very good. \n[60]  \n[61]Is this too blue? \n[62]Ay, yay yay. I look old. \n[63]They haven't signed the papers. \n[64] So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and... \n[65]What plan is that? \n[66] \n[67]Then you married an idiot. \n[68] \n[69]I don't wanna be in the cemetery! \n[70]I'm taking care of it. \n[71]I've had to move some things around for the merger. \n[72] Only two million? \n[73]You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks... \n[74] I don't know what you're talking about... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 17. \n[75] Where the hell is Mayfield? \n[76] \n[77]I'd love to hear about that, but... I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight. \n[78]I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield? \n[79]Detained where? \n[80] \n[81]Yeah, yeah yeah. \n[82]No. What's up? \n[83]What is it? \n[84] \n[85]What kind of entries? \n[86]Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke? \n[87]See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield. \n[88]How're they doing? \n[89]Yeah, but how are they doing? \n[90]Where's Julie? \n[91]Hey, Julie. \n[92]Oh, really? Painter? \n[93]  \n[94]I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second. \n[95]What? Why are you doing this? \n[96]I will take those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall. \n[97]Don't tell her it was me.  I mean it. \n[98]   \n[99]It's me. \n[100]I'm here. \n[101]I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here? \n[102]Look down the hall. Do you see me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24. \n[103]Okay, so I'm serious. \n[104]I thought we should talk... \n[105]...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations... \n[106]I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now. \n[107]I'm sorry. \n[108]Because I liked them. \n[109]Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail? \n[110]You know, I'm not the kinda guy who wants to throw money away but if you wanna start a business, you have to project a certain image. \n[111]Success. \n[112]The market's a disaster right now; nobody's moving anything. That's why you gotta show sales. People look at you then and they say \"Whoah, how'd she do that?\" -- and that's what they remember. Always. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 26. \n[113]Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go... \n[114]There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that. \n[115] \n[116]Lawrence Grant. \n[117]Jimmy, it's me. \n[118]I want you to listen to me very closely... \n[119]Let's go. \n[120]It's better you don't ask. \n[121]That's correct. \n[122]No, you're not. We're not here. \n[123]We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right? \n[124]Because if anyone checks... \n[125]They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here? \n[126]Somebody knows you're here? \n[127]But somebody knows-- you're not there. \n[128]Oh, Jesus, Jimmy... \n[129]What'd you say? \n[130]Do you trust her? \n[131]Do you trust her? \n[132]Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours. \n[133]Jimmy... \n[134]...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'... Goldenrod - 4.17.11 32. \n[135] Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help. \n[136]No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours. \n[137]Then I don't make it. \n[138] Better we don't talk for a while. \n[139]I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home. \n[140]   \n[141]     \n[142]I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed. \n[143]  \n[144]What? \n[145]I just went to... eat some ice cream. \n[146] Yes... \n[147]Ellen... \n[148]Do you still love me? \n[149]And such a person... \n[150]Fingerprints, DNA? \n[151]What about cell phone records? \n[152]Not from a cell phone, no. \n[153]What would you advise such a person to do? \n[154]Failing which? \n[155]Yeah. \n[156]I know. \n[157]You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses? \n[158]And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years? \n[159] What choice do I really have? \n[160]Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee. You know this. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 37. \n[161]No. Absolutely not. That's impossible. \n[162]The audit's cleared? \n[163]You're leaving? \n[164] \n[165] \n[166] \n[167]What? \n[168]What the fuck are you talking about? \n[169]Oh... Oh, it was fine... \n[170]He's here? Where? \n[171]He called? \n[172]You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot? \n[173]That's being issued now. \n[174]Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 39. \n[175]Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU \n[176]  \n[177]Reconcile what? \n[178]Of course I'm listening. Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet. \n[179] \n[180] \n[181] \n[182]Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it. \n[183] \n[184] Give me two minutes, then send him in... \n[185]Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later. \n[186]Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 41. \n[187]   \n[188]  \n[189]Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible. \n[190]Correct. \n[191]Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation. \n[192]Last night, at the gallery. \n[193]No, I think I left about ten. \n[194]Home. \n[195]Yeah. \n[196]Yeah. \n[197] \n[198]See her with anyone-- what do you mean? \n[199]Not that I noticed. No. No, no. \n[200]The driver? \n[201]This is awful. This is truly awful. \n[202]Actually we didn't talk about personal matters. \n[203]Well not an employee. I was an investor. \n[204]Why did I invest? \n[205]She had a great eye. She found me those Bryce Marden's there. They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that I agreed to fund some of the gallery. \n[206]Why would I mind? \n[207]Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead. \n[208]Mmm-hmm? \n[209]Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but-- I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers. \n[210]It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all this... \n[211]Alright. \n[212]But you're going to be indelicate... \n[213]Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place? \n[214]It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that. \n[215]Sure. \n[216]What? \n[217] Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet. \n[218]This morning. \n[219]Yeah. Me, too. \n[220]No problem. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 46. \n[221] Her Mom...? Service here? \n[222]Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me? \n[223]You reach Mayfield? \n[224]Thanks. Appreciate your concern. \n[225]You're gonna sign him out? \n[226]The basketball player? \n[227]He's the best? \n[228]You've gotta get Jimmy out of this. \n[229]What would he be looking at? \n[230]Come on, get in. \n[231]Jimmy... \n[232]It's gonna be okay. \n[233]We've got you the best criminal lawyer-- \n[234]Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay? \n[235]Your under suspicion. \n[236]I am aware of that. \n[237]I couldn't. \n[238]Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt. \n[239]Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me. \n[240]Listen... I want to talk to you a second. Come here. I wanna show you something. \n[241]Now, you know, your father asked me to look after you. \n[242]Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that.  So I've been able to set up a situation for you. \n[243]It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that. \n[244]What else is there? \n[245] What are you gonna do? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56. \n[246]I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you? \n[247]Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just-- read it. Just take it home and read it. It's not gonna hurt you. \n[248] \n[249]Yeah, put him through...  Chris... \n[250] \n[251]Chris... \n[252]Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 57. \n[253]Tell me what is going on. \n[254]Tell me what's going on! \n[255]Why not?! \n[256]What do you mean it's not...? \n[257] The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed? \n[258] \n[259]They? Who's they?  Who is they?! \n[260] \n[261]They're negotiating. He wants a better price. \n[262] \n[263]  \n[264]Did we have a meeting? \n[265]  \n[266] \n[267]You wanna sit? \n[268]I did. \n[269]Because I hoped you wouldn't. \n[270]I made a bad bet. \n[271]That's a dangerous word, Brooke. \n[272]Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing. \n[273]You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said \"Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months.\" So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune. \n[274]But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING \n[275]Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will. It's like a plane crash. It just happens. \n[276]Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you... \n[277]Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house. \n[278]Yes. \n[279]You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it. \n[280]What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt? \n[281] \n[282]You are not my partner! You work for me!  That's right. You work for me! Everybody works for me! Goldenrod - 4.17.11 67. \n[283]Brooke. Brooke. Come here. Please? Please. Just, just come here. Just for a second and sit down. \n[284] \n[285] \n[286]  \n[287]You're certain? \n[288] \n[289](laughs, plays with his \n[290]She's good. Fine.  Why? \n[291]Yes...? \n[292]The estate lawyer? \n[293]Not to me. \n[294]I am so, so sorry. \n[295] No... \n[296]It's just... not fair, is it? \n[297] \n[298]  \n[299]You keep sending people to my office to \"do business.\" \n[300]With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it?  Just coffee, please. \n[301]Fuck you. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 80. \n[302]FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you. \n[303]No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of 18 Million? And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately... THREE AND \n[304]...so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it? \n[305]You have a nice day, James. \n[306]Five-fifty. \n[307]Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no? And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can. \n[308] \n[309]And you're gonna have to make my son a VP. \n[310]No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no? \n[311]I'm writing the deal. \n[312] I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it. \n[313]I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...? \n[314]Four seventy-five. \n[315] Yeah. \n[316]Actually, I lied. I would've taken four. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 83. \n[317]...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions? \n[318]  \n[319]I met his price. I just took it out of your share. \n[320]Yeah. \n[321]Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check. \n[322] \n[323]Hello. \n[324]What you got? \n[325]You got any milk? \n[326]I'll take a water. \n[327]Where are you going? \n[328]The boxes. \n[329]I told you not to take the toll. \n[330]I said \"Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say.\" \n[331]But you took the toll anyway. \n[332]Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me... \n[333]So where'd they get the photograph from? \n[334]So, you're saying... it's a fake? \n[335]Don't be such a wiseass... \n[336] \n[337]What business? \n[338]What's an Applebee's? \n[339]You bought an Applebee's in Virginia? \n[340] \n[341]I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that? \n[342] \n[343] \n[344] Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit. \n[345]  \n[346]He says he didn't take the toll. \n[347] Does Standard have clawback? \n[348]Let's just say I decide to go in... \n[349]No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal? \n[350]Four years, you think? \n[351] \n[352]   \n[353]   \n[354] \n[355] \n[356]  \n[357] Wait. Wait. Just wait. A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it down, sees Earl, and opens the door. Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket as he talks. \n[358] \n[359] \n[360]Son of a bitch. \n[361]You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 95. \n[362]No, it makes it easier. \n[363]No. \n[364]Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did...  Was way beyond the money. \n[365] \n[366]   \n[367]Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon... \n[368] You okay? What is it? \n[369]Did she tell you that? \n[370]Yeah, I explained to Brooke that... \n[371]Yes. \n[372]What? \n[373] \n[374]What do you think you know? \n[375]I did what was necessary. \n[376]For my interests? \n[377]Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business. \n[378] \n[379]What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them? \n[380] \n[381]No, I kept her out. \n[382]What is this? \n[383]\"All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?\" Did you really expect me to sign this thing? \n[384]Apparently not, no. No. \n[385]Yeah, this leaves me with nothing. \n[386] \n[387]You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that! \n[388] \n[389]You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way. \n[390] \n[391]Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this! \n[392] \n[393]It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that. \n[394]She'll be better for it. The world is cold. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 101. ", "Brooke": "\n[1]It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten. \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]  \n[5]So what was that all about? \n[6]The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid. \n[7]You see this? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 8. \n[8]Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room. \n[9]Why sell our company? We make a great return, we give money to the causes we believe in... \n[10]Dad, you're not that old. \n[11] \n[12] \n[13]Did you get my message? \n[14]We need to sit down. \n[15]I don't want to talk about it here. \n[16] \n[17]I found some strange entries in the \"Old Hill\" books. \n[18]I'm not sure yet, but there's definitely something off. Goldenrod - 4.17.11 20. \n[19]Yeah. \n[20]I cannot reconcile it... \n[21]The \"Old Hill\" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me? \n[22]Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right. \n[23]...the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing. \n[24]I know, it's ridiculous, and yet... \n[25]Everything alright? \n[26]Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check? \n[27]Okay. \n[28] \n[29] \n[30] Can you explain these? \n[31]Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified. \n[32]Get out of my way. \n[33]You're hurting my arm. \n[34]You're fired, Ben. \n[35]I just did. \n[36]83 You tell me. 83 \n[37]I'll stand.  Didn't you think I'd find out? \n[38]Then why didn't you tell me? Goldenrod - 4.17.11 64. \n[39]Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now -- or I am done. \n[40]No, you committed fraud. \n[41]What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied?
