Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 42. \n[3]Is this for real? \n[4]So wait, I'm really the only heir? \n[5]Give me just a second. \n[6]My good people, I think there's a lesson here for all of us. Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 43. \n[7]And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always loved you. \n[8]Well good friends, it breaks my heart, but, enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world baby! \n[9]I'm building my city people! On Rock and Roll! \n[10]Ow! \n[11]I can't believe it... me a King? I...I mean I knew I came from royalty and all, but I just figured everyone forgot about me. \n[12]Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games. \n[13]Boat with the bottle? Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle. \n[14]Whoa!! This is gonna be huge.

Hello? \n[29]Mr. Merlin? \n[30]Yeah. He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown. \n[31]What's with the \"we\"? Who said I was going with you? \n[32]If it's such a great job, why don't you do it? \n[33]Oh, so that was your \"Mr. Nice Guy?\" \n[34]You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone? \n[35]This is lame. \n[36]Ow! \n[37]Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest. \n[38]Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone? \n[39]It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall! \n[40]Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what? \n[41]I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright? \n[42]Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68. \n[43]Well, I doubt he was worse than mine. \n[44]Okay... I guess that's... pretty bad. \n[45]You know, you're okay, Shrek. \n[46]You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69. \n[47]The soap's because you stink. Really bad. \n[48]Ow! \n[49]Help! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75. \n[50]No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea. \n[51]Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to get them...I mean, us, back to Far Far Away. \n[52]Mr. Merlin please. I know you can \n[53]\n[54]It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard... \n[55]No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people- \n[56]And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them? \n[57]Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78. \n[58] \n[59]Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you? \n[60]He's a star people! Hello?!

I'm supposed to be King, right? \n[65]But you said the King asked for me personally. \n[66]What's that supposed to mean? \n[67]You were playing me the whole time. \n[68]You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you - \n[69]Oh please, don't act so innocent. You both knew what was going on the whole time and you kept it to yourself. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 101. \n[70]It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all there is to it. \n[71]Everybody stop! \n[72]Who really thinks we need to settle things this way? \n[73]You're telling me you just want to be Villains your whole lives? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 110. \n[74]Didn't you ever wish you could be something else? \n[75]Okay, fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree. But, ya know, a good friend of mine once told me that just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre... \n[76]... or just some loser... \n[77]...it doesn't mean you are one. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 111. \n[78]The thing that matters most is what you think of yourself. \n[79]If there's something you really want, or there's someone you really want to be, then the only person standing in your way ...is you. \n[80]No, no, no!

My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me. \n[144]Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth. \n[145]You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them. \n[146]But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are. \n[147]Thanks Artie. \n[148]Yeah.
