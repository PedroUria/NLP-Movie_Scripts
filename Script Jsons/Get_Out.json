So, let me set the scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a freshman and she has a crush on this guy Connor-- \n[3]Yeah, Rose. \n[4]Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse team. Huge guy, like 6'3\", and crazy, just like \"Looney Tunes,\" right? We had thrown a party-- \n[5]I think my parents were in Greece or something. We had gotten into their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced. \n[6]We put water in the bottles so you wouldn't know. Let me finish. Okay, so I'm upstairs in my parents' bathroom hooking up with Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in our class. \n[7]Thanks. All of a sudden Connor starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it, and he's got blood gushing out of his mouth and he's screaming \"Your thith-ter bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!\" \n[8]Sure enough, there is a centimeter of tongue meat missing right here. \n[9]You an MMA fan? \n[10]What? \n[11]You've had your chance. He's dating my sister. I can't bond with the guy? \n[12]You ever get into street fights as a kid? \n[13]Cause, with your frame, your genetic make-up? If you pushed your body, I mean really trained, you'd be a beast. \n[14]We're talking about sports. Stand up. Let me show you something. \n[15]It's not karate, it's jiu-jitsu. \n[16]\n[17]I wasn't going to hurt him. \n[18]Chris, we need you... \n[19]HA! Come on. You can do better than that! \n[20]Yeah, I see that. \n[21]I'm just saying, if your boy isn't gonna bring his `A' game, we might as well bring Mom up here. \n[22]See, that's what I'm talking about!!! Okay, again! \n[23]Where are you going? The party's just getting started. \n[24]Whoa! Be careful, bro. \n[25]What? I'm not doing anything. \n[26]Oh shit! \n[27]Did you see him drop? \n[28]Rose gave it away. \n[29]I can take him alone. \n[30]No I'm not. \n[31]Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! \n[32] \n[33]Grampa! \n[34]Get him!!! \n[35]Kill him, Grandpa. \n[36]What...? Grandpa--? \n[37]Ahhhhhh! ", "Armitage": "\n[1]   \n[2]   \n[3]   \n[4]   \n[5]  \n[6] \n[7]  \n[8]   \n[9]   \n[10]    \n[11]  \n[12]   \n[13]   \n[14]  \n[15]   \n[16]    \n[17]   \n[18]  \n[19]    \n[20]  ", "Jim": "\n[1]Ignorant shit... \n[2]All of them. Ignorant assholes. They have no idea what real people go through. \n[3]Heh. No, you're right. And usually not even that much. That's people. \n[4]Jim Hudson. \n[5]I know who you are. I'm an admirer of your work; you have a great eye... \n[6]The irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me. \n[7]I have an assistant describe work to me. You've got something... The images you capture... so brutally melancholic. Powerful stuff. \n[8]I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have \"the eye\" for it; Began dealing. And then, of course, my vision went to shit. \n[9]I know. Life can be a sick joke. One day you're working in a dark room, and the next day - BAM. You wake up in the dark. Genetic disease. \n[10]Yeah. \n[11]Stop by the gallery some time. Bout time you had a solo show. \n[12]I think we could do wonderful things together. \n[13]Hello Chris. How's it going...? You can answer. There's an intercom in the room; I can hear you. \n[14]Yeah, sorry about that. If it makes you feel any better, I'm thirsty too. \n[15]Right. So, the reason I am talking to you now is so you can understand what is happening to you. I guess your `understanding' it raises the success rate of this whole thing. Not even sure I `understand' it. \n[16]Hot isn't she? Hot voice anyway, you dirty dog. You're one of the lucky one's. The son Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant. \n[17]They asked me for my favorite song, which was hard; I like all types of music. Turns out they really just needed one I knew all the words to: I went with James Taylor's \"You Got a Friend.\" I hope it hasn't been too torturous; that wasn't the point. The point is that you learn it, and for us to have that knowledge in common. \n[18]Oh right. Okay, let me back up and give you the cliff notes. The Armitages and I are a part of a society. A pretty extraordinary society actually. \n[19]One whose sole purpose for many many years has been a search for a very powerful object. Armitage lineage redefined the nature of that search. They proved that the power didn't just exist in that object; You see, with science the Armitage's created a miracle. \n[20]No. Not racist, Chris. We don't hate you. We want to be you... You are not going to be a slave. You're going to be a vessel. \n[21]Missy's hypnosis was merely to sedate you. Oh, that and to prepare you psychologically... \n[22]For the procedure. \n[23]Are you ready...? Drum roll please. Brain transplantation. Some say it could never be done; \n[24]They experimented for centuries, but it turned out re-linking the brain to a foreign central nervous system was impossible. The nerve connections are far too intricate and delicate. \n[25]Dean's the only guy who really gets the science. He's the one who discovered that full brain transplantation isn't actually necessary to transfer the soul, and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem. \n[26]Okay so... You see the blue part? That's the piece of your brain that's all rooted in the nervous system. So that stays; keeping those tricky little connections intact. The rest is discarded. Then they'll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours. Your \"blue\" and my \"red\" basically absorb each other. And apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast, so assuming everything goes as planned, we should be up and functioning in a couple weeks. \n[27]Your red part? It'll be discarded, but don't worry. You wont be gone. Well not completely. You'll still be in there somewhere; limited consciousness of course; \n[28]you'll still be able to see and hear but your existence will be as a passenger... an audience. You will live in... \n[29]Yes. That's what she calls it. Good! So you understand, I'll control the motor functions, the will of our body, effectively \n[30]As far as the world is concerned. It's still a pretty new operation. Some kinks. We're supposed to stay away from flashes of light for example. They can trigger a \"momentary lapse in control of motor functions...\" \n[31]Well, because you get the highest bids. For the last decade or so anyway. I wish it was less simple than that, but it's not. You're in fashion, baby! \n[32]Honestly though, personally..? I couldn't give two shits about race. I don't care if you're black, brown, green, purple... whatever. What I want is so much deeper: Your eye, man. I want those things you see through. \n[33]Take it as a compliment. \n[34]We have and we will. We'll be together soon, brother. ", "Hudson": "", "April": "\n[1]Who even cares about skin color? My God. ", "Dray": "", "Walter": "\n[1]Nothing I don't want to be doing. \n[2]I know who you are. You're Rose's friend. \n[3]She is lovely isn't she? \n[4]One of a kind; a real doggone keeper. \n[5]Sorry if I scared you last night. \n[6]And the hypnosis? Did it work? \n[7]Well, I should get back to work. \n[8]Ahhhhhhh! ", "Rod": "\n[1]`Sup? \n[2]Yeah. How I'm gonna get in trouble for following standard procedure? Fuckin' Gary out here thinkin' just because a bitch old, she can't hijack an airplane. \n[3]Like you can't hide a bomb in a wheelchair? Watch, Chris, the next 9/11 is gonna be on some geriatric shit. \n[4]What? You think I forgot? Damn `C', give your boy a little credit. I don't forget shit; you do. \n[5]Apology accepted. How's `Lil Miss Rosie? \n[6]Whattup babygirl? You better bring my boy back in one piece. \n[7]You know you picked the wrong guy though right? \n[8]Damn, I never seen you like this. Meeting the family and everything? What does she do lick your ass? \n[9]That's it! First girl licks your ass and you done. Just... \n[10]Yeah I do. I need your girl to introduce me to one of her freaky deaky boarding school friends. \n[11]Come on, son! I don't need your money. I got you! \n[12]You better not come back all bougie on me tho-- \n[13]Hey. \n[14]Not much. Sid's chillin'. We eatin' burgers. What's up with you? \n[15]Uh oh. That doesn't sound good. \n[16]Oh, they got you on display? \n[17]Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no! \n[18]--Nope. I don't give a fuck if she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch. You ain't getting in my head. \n[19]Who knows what they'll make you do. You know white people into some crazy sex slave shit. \n[20]Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate niggas' heads, but that was after he fucked the heads. \n[21]You think they saw that shit coming? Hell no. \n[22]One second they think they just gonna suck some dick, next second they sucking dick but their head isn't on their body Chris. \n[23]I saw that on A&amp;E, so that's real life. \n[24]Hypnotised. \n[25]I'm just connecting the dots you presenting me with. The mom puttin' trances on niggas and fuckin' them. It's clear as day and that's fucked up. She hot? \n[26]This is good shit tho. \n[27]Send me a picture. You are a photographer. \n[28]You should be documentin' this shit. \n[29]And yo, don't say I didn't warn you `cause my ass sure as Hell ain't coming up to the country to save you from no fuckin' witch coven... Unless the mom's hot. She hot? \n[30]That's Dre. \n[31]Andre um... Hayworth! Yeah! He used to kick it with Veronica. \n[32]...Teresa's sister! Worked at the movie theatre on 8th; \n[33]got us into the movie a couple of times; Rush hour 2 and, um Usual Suspect. \n[34]...But what? \n[35]Different? How? \n[36]No, he ain't. \n[37]Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes Wide Shut situation. You need to--. \n[38]Sup? Making sure you good. I thought you were coming back yesterday, so hopefully you home already and just sleeping or some shit. Aiight. Let me know. \n[39]Yeah... me too. \n[40]Oh shit. \n[41]Williams... Rod Williams... \n[42]Yes Ma'am. \n[43]It's not TSA business, ma'am. \n[44]No, sorry, not my son, my boy. He's my friend. He's 26. His name is Chris... Washington... \n[45]He left town on Friday with his girlfriend Rose... Armitage... She's white. \n[46]Yeah, I mean he's only been MISSING for two days. He was \n[47]--Three days I know, but I have reason to believe he's been abducted. \n[48]Chris was set to come back home on Sunday. I was watching his dog Sid. \n[49]Yup. Cute right? Now look... \n[50]Chris sent me this which he took at the girlfriend's parents house. That's Andre Hayworth, a guy we knew from back in the day. Come to find out he went missing 6 months ago in an affluent suburb upstate. \n[51]Well that's the thing. We found him and now, according to Chris, he's gay with a different personality. \n[52]But he didn't used to be. \n[53]I know what I'm about to say is gonna sound crazy. \n[54]You ready for this...? I think this family is abducting black people and brainwashing them to work for them as sex slaves and shit... Sorry. \n[55]Yeah. \n[56]...See, I don't know if the hypnosis makes you a slave or if just turns you gay or what, but they already got two brothers that we know of, and who knows how many more there could be. \n[57]Yo. Um, Rose? It's Rod. \n[58]Where's Chris? \n[59]He left? \n[60]No. He never made it back here. \n[61]I've been calling. I went to the police and everything. \n[62]Hello? \n[63]I told them he was missing. \n[64]So... What cab company did he use? \n[65]Hold on a second. \n[66]So, last time Chris and I talked, he told me your mom hypnotized him? \n[67]Huh? \n[68]Why is that? \n[69]What? \n[70]No. I'm calling about Chris. \n[71]That's my best friend. If you did \n[72]--No. You crazy... No. \n[73]I really need to... \n[74]...impress on you the importance of remembering some of those names. The fire didn't leave \n[75]You gotta help me out, Chris. Secret societies doesn't get you very far on Google. I'm over here feeling like I'm playing connect the dots on a fucking football field. One name... \n[76]Well, try again please. \n[77]Let's start at the beginning; walk me through it again. ", "Williams": "", "Dean": "\n[1]There's my girl! Hello sweetheart. \n[2]Mr. Armitage will do. \n[3]I got him. Come here. \n[4]Call me Dean. We hug around here, Fella. \n[5]My wife Missy. \n[6]\"Wow\" is good. We'll take wow. \n[7]It ought to be. Lord knows we've done enough work on it through the years... \n[8]Oh no! Where? \n[9]You know what I say. One down... a few hundred thousand to go. \n[10]What?! Those things are everywhere up here, Chris; like rats. The damage they've done to the ecology alone... Anyway, are we ready for the grand tour? \n[11]Leave `em. Walter will get `em. \n[12]Frankenstein's monster. Only pieces of the original structure remain; I like to think the soul is in tact though. \n[13]There are seven bedrooms, ten bathrooms, three indoor dining areas, two study's, two main kitchens. There's an observatory wing on the top floor. And you'd be hard pressed to find a room that doesn't serve as library. \n[14]That's Jeremy. Rose's brother. He's in Med school. \n[15]He went through a couple dark spots but came out the other side. You'll meet him later. \n[16]Mother and Father lived here till the end. They died a few years ago now. Passed away within weeks of each other... \n[17]\"Love\" is a powerful thing. \n[18]My Dad was a runner. A good runner; great sprinter. \n[19]Oh, In fact, you might find this interesting, he was just beat out by Jessie Owens in the qualifying round for the `36 Olympics in Berlin. That's the one where-- \n[20]You know your history. \n[21]Of course. One of those perfect moments. There's Hitler on his high horse with his perfect Aryan race, and here comes this black guy to prove him wrong on the world's stage. What a moment. \n[22]He almost got over it. \n[23]Okay Snowbell just looking. Missy's office. This is where she takes appointments. \n[24]Yeah. One of the best in the world. Not a tidy woman. \n[25]A neurosurgeon; was. I retired early. Now, I pretty much focus on the house and twiddle my thumbs. \n[26]Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar, the games room, some storage. Apparently a black mold issue down there. Almost everything needs to get thrown out; shame. \n[27]My mother loved her kitchen. \n[28]Oh, Georgina, this is Chris; Rose's boyfriend. \n[29]Ah ha! But now for the piece de resistance... \n[30]Badminton and bocce ball, croquet; we're a family who loves games. Two other families have properties on lake Pontaco, and they're way on the other side. Total privacy. \n[31]I know what you're thinking. \n[32]Well-to-do white family; black servants... \n[33]You didn't have to. We hired them a few years ago to help care for my parents; they became part of the family. Couldn't bear to let them go. I hate the way it makes us look though... \n[34]Yeah. \n[35]Well, crap. Walter! \n[36]Another dead bird! Damn things fly into the patio from time to time; break their necks. \n[37]Iced tea? \n[38]Oh, that's awful; so young. I'm so sorry to hear that. \n[39]`Atta boy Chris. Get used to saying that. \n[40]Can't resist the inevitable. \n[41]Ah, yes. \n[42]Uh oh. Get out of here before it's too late! \n[43]Oh no! A smoker!? \n[44]You should have Missy take care of that for you. \n[45]Hypnosis. Works like a charm. \n[46]I thought the whole thing was B.S. too. I smoked for 20 years. She puts me under once, now the sight of a cigarette makes me wanna vomit. \n[47]A tradition. Some of my Dad's old social club. Some old patients. Some just friends... \n[48]Jeremy's home. \n[49]Manners, Rose. Give the guest what he wants. \n[50]Okay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or Mets? \n[51]She's right. Let someone else talk for a bit. \n[52]--Alright, enough Jeremy! \n[53]Hello! \n[54]Achem! Once again, I want to thank you all for coming. Words cannot express how much it means to us that after all these years we can all still get together and share. I'm reminded of stories of how the knights of old would gather in honor of a new crusade... \n[55]Chris! There you are. I wanted to introduce you to some old friends. We'll do it quickly. Down the line: David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika Walden. \n[56] \n[57]It was a seizure. \n[58]Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with him now. Are you okay Chris? \n[59]It was an abnormal manifestation but yes, actually, sometimes they do. The flash on your phone must have triggered it. \n[60]It's a simple glitch of the brain. Nothing to be afraid of. \n[61]Of course. \n[62]Let's do sparklers shall we? Brighten the mood? \n[63]What is your purpose, Chris? \n[64]In life? What is your purpose..? \n[65]We've been looking for our purpose for such a long time. Fire has mesmerized man since the Stone Age. It is a reflection of our impermanence in the world. Fire is born, it breathes and then it dies. \n[66]There's a reason we worship the Sun, Chris. He who lights the way through the darkness of life. He in all his glory was around long before us and will be here long after we are gone, but he too will die some day! That's right even the Sun God will die. It is no less mortal than we, but it inspires us to defy it! So what do we do?-- \n[67]  \n[68]We bathe in his reflection, for one chance to emerge having defied death! \n[69]You'd take that baptism wouldn't you, Chris? The baptism of immortality? \n[70]Listen, Chris-- \n[71](Through tears of joyous \n[72]He hit his head pretty good. \n[73]It's important to me that they acknowledge the purpose. \n[74]You're going to drop him. \n[75]Saw... \n[76]The vessel. \n[77]Jeremy...? \n[78]Ro Ro...? \n[79]", "Chris": "\n[1]Are you kidding me? When you're not here that dog gets the best fuckin' pets of his life. \n[2]`Cause he know he's got you wrapped around his little paw. \n[3]Yeah. \n[4]  \n[5]Check... Check.... \n[6]I'm not gonna have one the whole weekend. \n[7]I'm nervous. \n[8]Yeah? How do you know? \n[9]Good answer. \n[10]Do they know I'm black? \n[11]Seems like you might give them a heads up. \n[12]You said, I'm the first black guy you'd ever dated. \n[13]So this is uncharted territory for them. \n[14]Bye. \n[15]How do they even let you in a hospital? \n[16]Yeah. You? \n[17]How long has it been? \n[18]Whoa... whoa!! Come on! I'm a grown man. If a man says he wants a cigarette, a man should be able \n[19]Okay, so that's like a dollar. You basically just throwin' dollars out the window. \n[20]I didn't buy them. Rod... Shit. \n[21]I almost forgot Rod. \n[22]Hey. You at work? \n[23]Look, man, real quick. You good to watch Sid this weekend right? \n[24]You're right. My bad. \n[25]She's good.-- \n[26]Okay, get your own girl. \n[27]No! What the fuck is wrong with you? \n[28]You need help. \n[29] \n[30]Thanks, man. \n[31]Last one! \n[32]You okay? \n[33]Yeah. That scared the shit out of me. \n[34]Stay here. \n[35]I don't know... See if it's okay? \n[36]Maybe it's gone-- \n[37]Right. That makes sense. \n[38]Yeah. \n[39]Oh... yeah. \n[40]I mean, I don't have a driver's license, I have a state I.D. \n[41]Baby. It's okay-- \n[42]That was some ride or die shit, baby. I like that. \n[43] \n[44]Hi. \n[45]Good to finally meet you... \n[46]Sure. \n[47]Alright. \n[48]I've heard so much about you guys. \n[49]I'm fine with the embarrassing by the way; go ahead. \n[50]Wow. \n[51]I grew up in a one bedroom, so for me, this is ridiculous. \n[52]It came out of nowhere. \n[53]Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out. \n[54]I cannot believe they kept it the same. \n[55]They're great. \n[56]No, they're totally sweet. \n[57]What?! Is this you? \n[58]I didn't know you acted. \n[59]Wait, what about the tour? \n[60]We just got here. I don't wanna be disrespectful... \n[61]I'm serious. Later. \n[62]I've heard stories. \n[63]Oh, cool. \n[64]I hear that happens a lot. \n[65]--Owens won in front of Hitler. \n[66]Not really. That one always just stood out in my mind. \n[67]Yeah, tough break for your father though. \n[68]She's a Therapist right? \n[69]Like mother like daughter. \n[70]And you're a surgeon? \n[71]That view. \n[72]Hi. \n[73]Yeah? \n[74]I wasn't gonna go there. \n[75]Hey. People need work. \n[76]My Dad was never really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was 11; She was hit by a car. \n[77]Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my cousins. We didn't have a lot of money or anything, but she's a good person; kept me off the streets. She gave me my first camera. \n[78]4 months? 5 months. \n[79]5? She's right; I'm wrong. \n[80]I mean, we've been trying to take it slow but... \n[81]At the blood drive. \n[82]No. I'm quitting. \n[83]How? \n[84]Oh. \n[85]Wow. I don't... Thank you. Um, I don't know. \n[86]The get-together? \n[87]I must have forgot. \n[88]Sounds fun. \n[89]No, no... These are good. I wanna hear this. \n[90]Whoa, what? \n[91] \n[92]Damn. That's badass, Bae. \n[93]Ah, Orioles. My mom was from \n[94]You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too brutal for me. I'm a lover, not a fighter. \n[95]Not really. I did take Judo for after-school in 1st grade. \n[96]Cool... Thanks? \n[97]I've got a rule. I don't play- fight with drunk dudes. \n[98]Yeah. Nerves got me I guess. \n[99]I still don't know if this is right for me. \n[100]I'm good. The dude was running out there. Scared me. \n[101]Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up. \n[102]Yeah. \n[103]It's perfect, thanks. \n[104]Yep. \n[105]So, how does this work? Are you going to swing a pocket watch in front of my face? \n[106]Heightened suggestibility. Okay, where do we start? \n[107]Yeah, my memory sucks. \n[108]I guess if it makes me quit... Wait... Has it started--? \n[109]I was home. I was watching TV. \n[110]Okay... Yeah, I found it. \n[111]I knew it. She was never late after work. When she didn't come home, I just knew something was wrong. \n[112]I found it. \n[113]Nothing. \n[114]I just sat there. Watching TV. \n[115]No. \n[116]I don't know. I thought if I did, it would make it real. \n[117]I found it. \n[118]--Found it. \n[119]I don't want to. \n[120]\n[121]No! NO!!! I'm done! Bring me back! Please!!!! \n[122]Mrs. Armitage!!! \n[123] \n[124] \n[125]Bring me back. Bring me back. Bring me back. \n[126]No! \n[127]Damn. \n[128]What's up? \n[129]They working you good out here, huh? \n[130]Ha! \n[131]Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I never really got to meet you actually, up close. I'm Chris. \n[132]Yeah. That's one way to put it. So, where you from originally? \n[133]Rose? Yeah, she is... \n[134]Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was pretty drunk. \n[135]I don't remember much. \n[136]Hypnosis? No, I didn't... \n[137]There's another bird... \n[138]Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I think your mom hypnotised me last night. \n[139] \n[140]No, not good. I can barely remember any of it even happening; I don't like that. Plus I had these fucked up dreams. \n[141]What did? \n[142]And, what's the deal with the help? \n[143]That, but also the lawn-mower guy creepin' me the fuck out too. \n[144]It's not what he says, it's how he says it. You know? \n[145]Thanks. You too. \n[146]Once, actually; a few years ago. I wasn't very good. \n[147]Oh? No kidding. \n[148]Wow, that's great. Cool. \n[149]Me? I could barely hit the thing. \n[150]It'd be kind of a waste of time travel though. \n[151]Wow. Um.. \n[152]Oh, will you now? \n[153]Right. I mean-- \n[154]I'm sorry. I'm going to get another drink. \n[155]It's good to see another brother around here. \n[156]Who do you know? \n[157]Chris. Rose's boyfriend. \n[158]Sure. \n[159]What? Oh, I forgot. \n[160]Who? \n[161]I guess people only see what's in front of them. \n[162]I mean... \n[163]\n[164] \n[165]Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson Galleries? \n[166]How do you do it? \n[167]Thank you. Yeah, I just like finding the beauty in abandoned things. \n[168]Damn. \n[169]Shit ain't fair, man. \n[170]Yeah, sure. Nice to meet you. \n[171]Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That would be a game changer. \n[172]Not my game, what can I say. \n[173]Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin' smack huh? \n[174]Boom! \n[175]Hold up. Here. \n[176]I'm gonna go to the bathroom. \n[177]The housekeeper unplugged my phone. \n[178]I'm trying to check in with Rod, and I got no juice. \n[179]Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she doesn't like the fact that I'm with you. \n[180]What? It's a thing. \n[181]Forget it. Nevermind. \n[182] \n[183]  \n[184]Bruh. What's up? \n[185]Yeah... \n[186]They just got me over here meeting all the family friends. It's like they never met a black dude that doesn't work for them or some shit. \n[187]Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised last night... \n[188]Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom is a hypnotherapist-- \n[189] \n[190]Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're not a kinky sex family, but- \n[191]And thanks for that image, right there. \n[192]It's the black people out here that are the weirdest. The help. It's like they're possessed or... \n[193] \n[194]What's fucked up is: You're the first line of defense against terrorism. \n[195]Oh, and the one other black guest is like the whitest-most dude at the party. \n[196]I mean Rod, if you could see what this dude is wearing. \n[197] \n[198]Thanks Rod, bye. \n[199]Hi. \n[200]Oh, no. It's cool. I was just confused. \n[201]Yeah, I-- \n[202]Really, it's okay. I didn't mean to rat you out. \n[203]...get you in trouble. \n[204]Too many names to remember but... \n[205]Yeah, I don't know, man. \n[206]That's actually a great question. Logan! They were asking me about the African American experience. Maybe you could take this one. \n[207]Shit. \n[208]Hey, man, I'm sorry, I-- \n[209]Yeah. Why did he come at me like that? \n[210]No, I'm sorry about the flash. I didn't know. \n[211]Yeah, you too. \n[212]My cousin is epileptic. That wasn't a seizure. \n[213]Also, this is gonna sound weird, but when he got up in my face like that, I got the feeling like I knew that guy. \n[214]Let's go back home tonight. \n[215]I'm just... Something doesn't feel right. \n[216]No. With this whole situation! I just... I can't explain but I need you to trust me. Let's just go. It doesn't even have to be a big deal. \n[217]Baby, I-- \n[218]Late? \n[219]Oh. \n[220]I don't know what to say. \n[221]I told you about the night my mom died. How I didn't call 911; didn't go out looking for her. \n[222]One hour went by, then two, three... I just sat there... I just watched TV. \n[223]I found out later she had survived the initial hit. \n[224]She laid there bleeding by the side of the road all night, cold and alone. And that's how she died in the early morning... Cold and alone. And I was watching TV. \n[225]There was time. If someone was looking for her, there was time. But no one was looking. \n[226]Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna leave here without you. I`m not going to abandon you. Never. \n[227]Yeah? \n[228]I love you. \n[229]That was fast. \n[230]  \n[231]Dre? \n[232]Veronica from... \n[233]Yeah. That is him. But... \n[234]This is so fuckin' crazy. He's different now. \n[235]Different. Slower... I mean he was street; now he's all like... white- seeming. Oh, plus he's gay! \n[236]I'm telling you: He's gay, I met his man. He's-- \n[237]Um... Looking for my camera. \n[238]Where are the keys..? I gotta put our bags in the trunk. \n[239]Nah, I'll do it. \n[240]Nothing. \n[241]I'm going to the car; see if we left the keys in there. \n[242]I'm good. \n[243]Yeah. \n[244]No. Well, yeah... Um. \n[245]What? \n[246]Right now, it's finding the keys. \n[247]Rose... \n[248]Rose, what is this shit?! \n[249]--Rose.-- \n[250]I was raised Episcopalian. \n[251]--I don't know what you're saying! \n[252]Rose!
