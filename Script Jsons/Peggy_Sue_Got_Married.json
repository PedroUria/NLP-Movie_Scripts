Which one's the \t\tdaughter and which one's the \t\tmother?  \n[2]\t\tI wish I had the nerve. And the \t\tfigure.  \n[3]\t\tIt must run in the family.  \n[4]\t\tPeggy, would you find a table? \t\tWe'll see you in a little while.  \n[5]\t\t\t \t\tWhat kind of question is that? It \t\thas nothing to do with the reunion.  \n[6]\t\t\t \t\tPeggy was a mess right after they \t\tseparated, but I think she's coming \t\tout of it... It seems to be pretty \t\tfriendly now..  \n[7]\t\t\t \t\tWalter Getz.  \n[8]\t\t\t \t\tMichael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?  \n[9]\t\tYes, ma' am.  \tThey help Peggy up and lead her across the gym.  \n[10]\t\tI was there. She told the creep off \t\tright to his face.  \n[11]\t\tIt's some stupid old movie thing \t\tthey just started.  \n[12]\t\tTherefore, the key to a successful \t\tchildren's party can be summed up \t\tin one word \u0097 planning.. With \t\tproper planning, a successful, \t\tinexpensive happy birthday party \t\tcan be had by all. Including the \t\tmother.  \tShe walks back to her seat.  \n[13] \tThirty kids are dancing, talking, snacking. One couple makes \tout. Walter, Leon, Terry and Doug Snell are crowded around a \tTV, watching an old western with Eugene Pallette or Edgar \tBuchanan. The boys laugh as Pallette or Buchanan growls a \twestern cliche.  \n[14] \tCharlie and Peggy are poised at the door.  \n[15] \tArthur and a few others stand by the bar, where bottles of \tCoke are lined up. Arthur carefully pours rum from a hip \tflask directly into the bottles. Peggy and Charlie enter.  \n[16]\t\tCan you believe I want to marry \t\tthat dork.  \n[17]\t\tI was thinking of four ushers and \t\tfour bridesmaids.  \n[18]\t\tI'm thinking of pink and green.  \n[19]\t\tLook at Dolores. What a tramp.  \n[20]\t\tMaybe they'll be the next Dion and \t\tthe Belmonts.  \n[21]\t\tCome on, where's your enthusiasm?  \tCharlie SINGS directly to Peggy, grinning at her. In spite of \therself, she smiles back at him. She's starting to realize \twhy she fell in love with him. He's irresistible.  \n[22]\t\t\t \t\tI don't know what you said to her, \t\tbut I wish I'd said it.  \tCharlie and Walter walk over and accept \"BRAVOS\" from the \tgirls. Walter does his James Dean imitation.  \n[23] \tMUSIC FADES INTO the song \"PARTY DOLL\" by Buddy Knox.  \tPeggy is doing the Twist, showing Charlie and several others. \tWalter gets the hang of it, twisting on one leg.  Carol tries \tto keep up.  Maddy and Arthur are always a beat behind.  \n[24]\t\tHow come we're your best friends \t\tand we had to find out about you \t\tand Michael Fitzsimmons from \t\tDolores?  \n[25]\t\tThat's disgusting!  \n[26]\t\tYeah. He's so cool and mysterious.  \n[27]\t\tPeggy Sue!  \n[28]\t\tBut I always thought that you would \t\tmarry Charlie, Carol would marry \t\tWalter, and I would marry Arthur. \t\tWe'd all live on the same street \t\tand take our kids to the park \t\ttogether and have barbecues every \t\tSunday. It'll spoil everything if \t\tyou and Charlie break up. That \t\tMichael doesn't look like the \t\tbarbecue type.  \n[29]\t\tYeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's \t\tpicking me up soon.  \n[30]\t\tSometimes you're so immature.  ", "Nagle": "", "Nancy": "\n[1]\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[2]\t\tCome on! Mom said you were sick. \t\tYou're never happy to see me.  \n[3]\t\tTeenagers are weird. And you're the \t\tweirdest.  \n[4]\t\t\t \t\tOkay, what do you want? What dumb \t\tfavor do you want me to do?  \n[5]\t\tLook at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he \t\tdreamy? I wish he'd break up with \t\tArlene. She thinks she's so great.  \n[6]\t\tWhy not? They're my favorite.  \n[7]\t\tPeggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian!  \tPeggy steadies herself as CAMERA TRACKS her back into the \tliving room.  \n[8]\t\tWhat's for dinner?  \n[9]\t\tYeech, not again.  \tPeggy leans forward in the recliner eating the candies. \tBemused, she looks at Nancy watching TV and into the kitchen \twhere her mother is slapping together meatloaf.  \n[10]\t\tLike wow! Wait till I tell Diane. \t\tShe's always bragging about her \t\tfather's Cadillac.  \n[11]\t\tCan I borrow this sweater?  \n[12]\t\tPass the toast, please.  \tPeggy passes Nancy the toast.  \n[13]\t\tAnd the butter.  \n[14]\t\t\t \t\tDADDY\u0097o.  \n[15]\t\tCan I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got \t\tdrunk or is that a deep family \t\tsecret? \t\t\t \t\tWell?  \n[16]\t\tShe's distorted.  \n[17]\t\tShe's almost a juvenile delinquent.  \tMr. Kelcher gives Nancy a look and points to the door. \tWithout her father noticing, Nancy creeps up behind him and \tmakes rabbit ears behind his head. Charlie tries hard not to \tlaugh. Nancy continues to clown.  \n[18] \tPeggy is helping her sister Nancy with an art project.  \n[19]\t\tYou think this'll cheer Dad up?  \n[20] \tNancy is frightened.  \n[21]\t\tDoes this mean we're going to be \t\tpoor?  \tPeggy leads her back into her room without letting her \tparents know they were there.  \n[22]\t\tBut Mom helped.  ", "Kelcher": "\n[1] \tThe car pulls up to the curb. Peggy gets out of the car. \tMaddy hands her the note and her books; she twirls her finger \tnext to her head.  \n[2] \tPeggy enters and looks down the hallway into the kitchen. \tEVELYN KELCHER is a lovely woman in her mid\u0097forties. She \tturns around from the sink and approaches Peggy.  \n[3]\t\tThe nurse called and said you'd be \t\tcoming home.  \tPeggy stares blankly at her for a beat, then holds up the \tnote, as she moves towards her mother.  \n[4]\t\tHow do you feel?  \n[5]\t\tWhy don't you go lie down for a \t\twhile.  \n[6]\t\tOf course, dear. You're home now.  \n[7]\t\t\t \t\tI put your laundry on your beds. \t\tDon't forget to put it away.  \n[8]\t\tMeatloaf.  \n[9]\t\tGirls? Evelyn? Who left this thing \t\toutside?  \tHe turns and heads back outside.  \n[10]\t\tWhat is it?  \tMrs. Kelcher and Nancy follow him outside. Peggy staggers to \tthe front door and leans against the door jamb looking out at \tthe family.  \n[11]\t\tWhat do you think?  \n[12]\t\t\t \t\tOh, Jack.  \n[13]\t\tPeggy Sue, what do you think?  \n[14]\t\tYoung lady, you're drunk!  \n[15]\t\tI don't see the humor in this. Go \t\tto your room immediately. You're \t\tgrounded.  \n[16]\t\tJack, take it easy. She gave blood \t\tat school today. Maybe she's just a \t\tlittle light\u0097headed.  \n[17]\t\tThis is not giving blood. This is \t\tdrunk.  \n[18]\t\tEvelyn, put her to bed.  \n[19]\t\tMy little baby. Don't try to grow \t\tup so fast.  \n[20]\t\tA new car. We can't afford a new \t\tcar.  \n[21]\t\tDon't worry, it's just a seasonal \t\tslump.  \n[22]\t\tYou have four seasons, you have \t\tfour slumps.  \n[23]\t\tWhat happened to your hair? You \t\thave such a pretty face. Why are \t\tyou always trying to cover it up?  \n[24]\t\tYou're looking pretty chipper this \t\tmorning.  \n[25]\t\tThank you.. I accept your \t\tapology with the hope that what \t\twent on yesterday will never \t\thappen again.  \n[26]\t\tYou're so young, this is not the \t\ttime to start acquiring bad habits.  \n[27]\t\tWhen did you start drinking coffee?  \n[28]\t\tIf all the kids jumped off a \t\tbridge, would you do that too?  \n[29]\t\tWell, at least you stopped calling \t\tme Daddy\u0097O.  \n[30]\t\tHow does Diane like her braces?  \n[31]\t\tWhat's the matter? Did you two \t\thave a fight?.  \n[32]\t\tWhat about?  \n[33] \tPeggy exits the house wincing at the sight of Charlie's car, \tthe blue Impala she'd seen the day before. Charlie sits, one \tarm on the wheel, the other over the back of the seat.  \n[34] \tPeggy comes home, enters hallway.  \n[35]\t\tThis necklace is sapphire, it was \t\tmy Grandmother's.  \tPeggy Looks into the living room.  \n[36] \tPeggy hears her mother let the man out. She enters the \tkitchen.  \n[37]\t\tIt was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, \t\ttaker. I'm thinking of voting \t\tDemocrat this year. But don't \t\tmention it to your father. How was \t\tschool today?  \n[38]\t\tWould you get that, dear?  \n[39]\t\tPeggy! What's the matter? Who is \t\tit?  \n[40]\t\tPeggy Sue! What is it?  \tForcing herself to regain her composure, she sits down at the \ttop of the landing as Mrs. Kelcher joins her.  \n[41]\t\tWhat happened to you?  \n[42]\t\tWell, she is getting on, but she's \t\tfine. I told her you weren't \t\tfeeling well yesterday. She called \t\tto find out how you are.  \n[43]\t\tYes, he's fine, too. You saw them \t\tat Easter.  \n[44]\t\tThat's a good girl... I hate to see \t\tyou so upset. \t\t\t \t\tTell me, sweetheart. Are you having \t\tproblems with Charlie? You \t\tmentioned something this morning.  \n[45]\t\tIs Charlie pressuring you to do \t\tthings you don't think you should \t\tbe doing?  \n[46]\t\tPeggy, do you know what a penis is? \t\t\t \t\tStay away from it.  \n[47] \tCharlie pulls up to the curb, opens the glove compartment, \textracts a can of Old Spice aerosol, sprays the seat; and \texits his car, throwing a kiss to it as he walks up to the \tdoor.  \n[48] \tMr. Kelcher opens the door, Charlie enters.  \n[49]\t\tHello, Charlie.  \n[50]\t\tFine, thanks. Come on in. I want to \t\ttalk to you.  \tCAMERA TRACKS Charlie and Mr. Kelcher into the living room. \tMr. Kelcher sits on his recliner, Charlie, nervous, on the \tcouch. Nancy is on the rug, studying.  \n[51]\t\tYou may have noticed that Peggy \t\tSue's been acting a little strange \t\tlately.  \n[52]\t\tShe seems confused, irresponsible, \t\toveremotional. My wife says that's \t\tthe way girls act sometimes.  \n[53]\t\tCharles, in spite of your \t\tadolescent infatuation with music, \t\twe've always regarded you a a fine \t\tyoung man. We've trusted you with \t\tour daughter.  \n[54]\t\tCharlie's downstairs. Why aren't \t\tyou ready?  \n[55]\t\tMaddy's party.  \n[56]\t\tYou accepted an invitation, Maddy's \t\tone of your best friends, and I \t\tbaked the Rice Krispie squares.  \tPeggy laughs.  \n[57]\t\tEnjoy yourself! This is the best \t\ttime of your life. And the sooner \t\tyou learn to handle Charlie the \t\tbetter. Get dressed.  \tMrs. Kelcher closes the door.  \n[58]\t\tWe think this party might cheer \t\ther up. Just make sure you know \t\twhat's expected of you.  \n[59]\t\tShow her a good time, but for God's \t\tsake restrain yourself.  \n[60] \tPeggy and Charlie exit and walk towards his car. Peggy's \tholding a pan of Rice Krispie squares. Charlie slips Peggy's \tsweater back on her shoulder. He's trying hard to make up.  \n[61] \tCharlie drops her off.  \n[62] \tPeggy walks up the path as the MILKMAN approaches.  \n[63] \tPeggy enters, trying to be quiet. Mr. Kelcher stands in\tthe \tkitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming.  \tCAMERA TRACKS Peggy into kitchen. She grabs a cup of\tcoffee \tbefore sitting down.  \n[64]\t\tWhere have you been?  \n[65]\t\tDamn that Charlie I  \n[66]\t\t\t \t\tPeggy, let me ask you something. \t\t\t \t\tYou're not... expecting are you?  \n[67]\t\tThank God for that.  \n[68]\t\tYes but I was a boy. And I still \t\thad hell to pay.  \n[69]\t\tAll right. But this better be good.  \n[70]\t\tDo you know how ridiculous you \t\tsound? First of all, it's illegal \t\tfor U.S. citizens to buy gold. And \t\tin the second place, the price of \t\tgold is regulated by the \t\tgovernment.  \n[71]\t\tThat's your problems The more women \t\tthink, the more trouble they get \t\tinto.  \n[72]\t\tI've heard just about enough of \t\tthis lunacy! Go to your room!  \n[73]\t\tEvelyn, take her to her room!  \tPeggy stalks out of the kitchen to the front door.  \n[74]\t\tI'm not the maid!  \n[75] \tAlone in the store, Mr. Kelcher is going through some \treceipts. Peggy enters carrying a shopping bag.  \n[76]\t\tDoing some shopping?  \tPeggy reaches into the shopping bag and pulls out a small \twrapped box.  \n[77]\t\tFor me?  \n[78]\t\tSweetheart, they're beautiful. But \t\tthey must've been expensive.  \tAcross the street an ice cream truck pulls up. Mothers, \tfathers and children crowd around the back as the driver exit \tthe cab.  \n[79]\t\tGood, you got your money out of \t\tthat greedy bank.  \n[80]\t\tIt's hard to believe you're going \t\tto be eighteen. \t\t\t \t\tWant an eskimo pie? Or a \t\tcreamsicle? \t\tI'd come home from the store and \t\tthere's little you running up to \t\tme. I'd give you a dime and you'd \t\tpromise never to grow up.  \n[81]\t\tThis morning was good.  \n[82]\t\tI, that what all that nonsense was \t\tabout this morning? You're worried \t\tabout my business?  \n[83]\t\tThat's very thoughtful, honey. It's \t\tjust a slump. Things will pick up.  \n[84]\t\tKennedy's a Catholic. He'll never \t\twin.  \n[85]\t\tRichard Nixon's going to be \t\tPresident. Nixon wears hats.  \n[86]\t\tI don't need your charity. I don't \t\tneed your grandmother's jewelry or \t\tyour parents money -\u0097how could you \t\tdo that?  \n[87]\t\tPlease don't shout.  \tPeggy opens the door, Nancy cautiously behind.  \n[88]\t\tI'm not shouting. Have we ever \t\tstarved? Have we ever missed a \t\tmea1?  \n[89]\t\tDoes everybody have to hear?  \n[90]\t\tI want everybody to hear because I \t\tdon't have anything to be ashamed \t\tof.  \tMr. Kelcher collapses into his barcalounger, red as a beet.  \n[91]\t\tJack, I was just trying to help.  \n[92]\t\tWe'll make it, we'll be fine.  \n[93] \tPeggy turns to face her parents, holding up her home\u0097made \tpantyhose with a flourish.  \n[94]\t\tThis is your great invention? \t\t\t \t\tWould you wear those things?  \n[95]\t\tWould they go over my girdle or \t\tunder?  \n[96]\t\tJack, I think she's got something \t\tthere.  \n[97]\t\tThat's all well and good, but we \t\tdon't have the money to manufacture \t\tthem.\t  \n[98]\t\tIsn't that awfully forward?  \n[99]\t\tYou mean to tell me that you \t\tinvited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over \t\tto talk about investing his money \t\tin your cockamamie idea?  \n[100] \tWe HEAR distant CHURCH BELLS. Peggy sits down to scan the \tlarge Sunday newspaper. Seeing her mother's phone book, she \tfinds the number she needs and picks up the phone. She dials \tslowly.  \n[101] \tMrs. Kelcher stands at the counter preparing a pot roast. \tPeggy's making a chocolate mousse.  \n[102]\t\tYou know, dear, I think the \t\tpantyhose is a wonderful idea, but \t\tthe next time you come up with \t\tsomething, please don't stay out \t\tall night. Just tell us. We'll \t\tbelieve you.  \n[103]\t\tWhat's pasta?  \n[104] \tPeggy and Mrs. Kelcher are setting the table, taking the good \tchina out of the cabinet. A dozen red roses grace the table.  \n[105]\t\tThese roses are beautiful. And so \t\tromantic'. Who is this Michael? Is \t\the a friend of Charlie's?  \tShe moves the Jell-O mold.  \n[106]\t\tWhat does Charlie think about that?  \n[107]\t\t\t \t\tWhat? When did it happen? Your dad \t\tand I always expected you two to \t\tget married.  \n[108]\t\tOf course I loved your Lather. \t\tI remember once being offered a \t\tscholarship to art school. But I \t\tturned it down.  \n[109]\t\tAll the college girls I knew were \t\tso well, dressed. I was worried \t\tthat I wouldn't fit in. I didn't \t\thave the right clothes. I was so \t\tsilly. But, I don't have many \t\tregrets, and besides, r don't have \t\ttime to worry about the past. But \t\tCharlie. I hope you know what \t\tyou're doing.  \n[110]\t\tPeggy Sue cooked the whole dinner.  \n[111]\t\tAh, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn \t\tto the den for a while?  \n[112] \tPeggy~ and Michael stand by Michael's motorcycle, passing a \tcigarette.  \n[113] \tMichael and Peggy pull up. Peggy gets off the bike and gives \tMichael a good\u0097night kiss.  \n[114] \tMrs. Kelcher finishes the dishes, with rubber gloves on. Mr. \tKelcher sits, cleaning his pipe. Peggy enters.  \n[115]\t\tIt's the darndest thing. Ed knew \t\twhat they were immediately. As a \t\tmatter of fact, he said he's got a \t\tproduct like that in development \t\tright now.  \n[116]\t\tDidn't call, them pantyhose, \t\tthough. What was it, Evelyn?  \n[117]\t\tSheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? \t\tLike leotards.  \n[118]\t\tPeggy Sue, watch your mouth.  \n[119]\t\tMr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent \t\tman.  \n[120]\t\tLook young lady, I grew up through \t\tthe depression. I fought in the \t\tsecond World War. Six days a week I \t\tget up and deal with the public, \t\tthe bank and the bill collectors. \t\tAnd on the seventh day, when God \t\trests, I don't have to listen to my \t\tdaughter calling me a fool!  \n[121]\t\tYou have a point, dear.  ", "Elizabeth": "\n[1]\t\tPeggy Sue!  \tPeggy slowly walks down the steps, moved to tears. She \tapproaches her grandparents and drops her suitcases. She hugs \tthem tightly. The bus door closes and the bus pulls away \tbehind them.  \n[2]\t\tI've already got some in. I was \t\tthinking of making a pie for dinner \t\ttonight. \t\t\t \t\tHow would you like that?  \n[3]\t\tThat's a day's work. But if that's \t\twhat you want, maybe we can do it \t\ttomorrow for your birthday.  \n[4]\t\tYou know, Peggy Sue, your mother \t\tsaid you had a dream that I died.  \n[5]\t\tI'm not afraid. I know exactly when \t\tI'm going to die.  \tPeggy is perplexed by her grandmother's apparent lack of \tfear.  \n[6]\t\tI'm not telling.  \n[7]\t\tIf you believe it, darling, then I \t\tbelieve. Being young can be just \t\tas confusing as being old. The \t\tthings that happened to me fifty \t\tyears ago are more on my mind than \t\twhat happened yesterday.  \n[8]\t\tRight now you're just browsing \t\tthrough time. Choose the things \t\tyou'll be proud of. The things that \t\tLast.  \n[9]\t\tWhat's Peggy Sue going to do at \t\tyour lodge meeting?  \n[10]\t\tHe won't tell me, but I've got my \t\tsuspicions. And I don't want any of \t\tthat. Don't keep her out late.  \n[11]\t\tHave a good time.  \tBarney and Peggy open the door and exit.  ", "Alvorg": "", "Peggy": "\n[1]           \tOver BLACK, we HEAR the sounds of an old TAPE RECORDING. \tYoung VOICES are filtered amid a noticeable hum, hiss and \tcrackle. We HEAR giggling and then someone named Charlie \tmaking vows of love to someone named Peggy Sue.  \n[2]\t\tPeggy Sue.  \n[3]\t\tDon't say that...  \n[4] \tA split\u0097level house on a slight grade of lawn. A red Honda \tthe driveway.  \n[5]\t\tCharlie...  \n[6]\t\tI can't. I'm too embarrassed.  \n[7]\t\tYeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.  \n[8] \tJanet is seated in Charlie's car.  \n[9]\t\tThere's something pathetic parked \t\tin front of my house.  \n[10]\t\tI'm still waiting for the mortgage \t\tcheck.  \n[11]\t\tWell, today's Saturday and it's \t\tstill not here.  \n[12]\t\tThat stays.  \tThe workman looks to Charlie for approval. Charlie nods. The \tworkman shrugs, and heads back to the basement.  \n[13]\t\tI don't buy them anymore. You were \t\tthe only one who drank them.  \n[14]\t\tI know. Put Scott through college.  \n[15]\t\tAre you taking Janet to the reunion \t\ttonight?  \n[16]\t\tBye sweetheart.  \tPeggy and Charlie look at each other as Scott leaves.  \n[17] \tPeggy and Beth carry the cake boxes into the car  A NEIGHBOR \ttrimming the hedge watches them lasciviously.  \tPeggy and Beth drive off.  \n[18]\t\tIf the pastries aren't here by nine \t\tthirty, call Monica and threaten \t\ther life.  \tPeggy gets into the car, and blows a kiss to Beth.  \n[19]\t\tI'll be back by noon.  \tPeggy drives off as MONICA drives up. She exits her car and \tbegins to unpack cake boxes.  \n[20] \tPeggy is driving. On her car radio, we HEAR a local PHONE\u0097IN \n[21]\t\tOh, Dolores.  \tPeggy switches stations until she finds the news.  \n[22]\t\tCarol!  \n[23]\t\t1 just did it for the reunion. I \t\tthought it would be fun.  \n[24]\t\tThis is my old friend Carol.. I \t\ttold you about her.  \tBeth and Carol exchange hellos.  \n[25]\t\tHow do you like my hair?  \n[26]\t\tTurn that off.  \n[27] \tCAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV into Peggy's bedroom. Beth gets \tup from the bed and turns off the TV. Peggy enters from the \tadjoining bathroom, wearing a robe, and bobby socks with \tsaddle shoes. She picks up a gold Locket from the dresser, \tand puts it on.  \n[28]\t\tI have a lot of unresolved feelings \t\tabout him. I don't trust him. \t\tBesides, I hate those commercials.  \n[29]\t\tBut I want you and Scott to \t\tunderstand. \t\t\t \t\tDo you think he loves Janet? Maybe \t\the's smashed too many fortune \t\tcookies.  \n[30]\t\tThen we'd both have a miserable \t\ttime. What do you think?  \tShe looks exactly like a sixties teenager.  \n[31]\t\tBorrow?! This was my dress. \t\t\t \t\tMaybe it's a mistake. What if I'm \t\tthe only one? I don't even want to \t\tgo. Everybody's just going to \t\tsay... \t\t\t \t\tHi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?  \n[32]\t\tNot from the guy with the \t\tlowest prices in town.  \n[33]\t\tI feel ridiculous. Maybe I should \t\tgo home and change.  \n[34]\t\tI don't know. Reunions do funny \t\tthings to people.  \tAt that moment they're joined by MADDY. and ARTHUR \tNAGLE, coming up behind them. A typical polyester couple. \tHellos all around and hugs. Arthur puts his arms around Beth \tand Peggy and leads them up the stairs.  \n[35]\t\tIt was Beth's idea.  \n[36]\t\tArthur, please don't call me Peg.  \n[37]\t\tBeth's boyfriend is playing in the \t\tband.  \n[38]\t\tOkay.  \tThey walk away into the crowd, leaving Peggy alone.  \n[39]\t\tI was once. Richard!? Richard \t\tNorvik? I didn't recognize you.  \n[40]\t\tI just did it for tonight. I don't \t\tnormally dress like this.  \n[41]\t\tHello. Nice to meet you. Please \t\tcall me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell \t\tnow.  \n[42]\t\tHe's not here. We're getting \t\tdivorced.  \n[43]\t\tI don't know how you do it. I've \t\tnever even dated anybody but \t\tCharlie.  \n[44]\t\tWe did for a long time. We just got \t\tmarried too young, and ended up \t\tblaming each other for missing out \t\ton things.  \n[45]\t\tIt's not the place. I don't buy \t\tthat. \t\t\t \t\tTrapped in the same town forever. \t\tThe price she would pay for her \t\tteenage lust.  \n[46]\t\tOh, it's not so bad. I have two \t\twonderful kids, my own business. \t\t\t \t\tStill, knowing what I know now, if \t\tI had the chance to do it all over \t\tagain, I'd sure do things a lot \t\tdifferently.  \n[47] \tPeggy sits with Richard, Sharon, and two other couples, TERRY \tand LISA and LEON and SANDY.  \tA hand gently touches Peggy on the shoulder. Peggy turns \taround and sees ROSALIE TESTA, a small woman with close \tcropped hair. She's in a wheelchair. She wears a plastic \tbadge: REUNION COMMITTEE.  \n[48]\t\tRosalie Testa!  \t'HELLOS' all, around. Peggy helps Rosalie position her \twheelchair at the table.  \n[49]\t\tYou have an incredible memory.  \n[50]\t\tYes. These are my children. But \t\tthey're not babies anymore.  \n[51] \n[52]\t\tMichael Fitzsimmons. I had such a \t\tcrush on him.  \tCarol and Maddy join them, still panting from dancing.  \n[53]\t\tYour first boyfriend. What do \t\tyou think? Any sparks left?  \n[54]\t\t\t \t\tWalter Getz.  \n[55]\t\tSharon Norvik this is Carol Heath, \t\tand Maddy Nagle. My oldest and \t\tdearest friends. Sharon's married \t\tto Richard.  \n[56]\t\tNo. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't \t\ttrack him down.  \n[57]\t\tHe was the only one in high school \t\tI wished I'd gone to bed with.  \n[58]\t\tWell, besides Charlie, of course.  \tWe HOLD on the photo of Michael and...  \n[59]\t\tWell, you showed them. You're rich \t\tand famous and successful. And you \t\thave a beautiful wife.  \n[60]\t\tWhat was?  \n[61]\t\tYou're a sweet man, Richard.  \n[62]\t\tYou know, I never told anybody \t\tthis, but I always had a feeling \t\tthat when you die, before you go to \t\theaven, you get a chance to fly \t\taround high school for a while.  \tCAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as Peggy and Richard become part of \tthe sea of dancers, all Lost in nostalgic reverie.  \n[63] \tLooking at Charlie.  \n[64] \tAt opposite ends of the reunion, but aware of each other.  \n[65] \tThey all look to Richard, knowing he's the obvious choice.  \n[66]\t\t\t \t\tI can't. It's all too much.  \n[67]\t\t\t \t\tThank you.. Thank you very much.  \tThe lights dim, leaving Peggy in the spotlight. Continued \tAPPLAUSE as the singer steps up to his mike and begins to \tSING the song PEGGY SUE.  \n[68] \tPeople starting to clap and sing along. Carol and Carol's \tPOV: a blow\u0097up on the wall of Carol in the senior play. \tWalter and. Walter's POV: a photo of Walter on the basketball \tteam. People leaving their tables, surging towards the stage, \tdrawn by the music. Maddy and Maddy's POV: a photo of Maddy \tand friends mugging for the camera in the cafeteria. Charlie \ttalking to Carol.  \tPeggy begins to cry softly. The images begin to melt \ttogether, pulsing to the music. Peggy is the focus of \teveryone's nostalgia. A wave of time washes over them.  \tShe remains onstage, looking past the crowd to the photo of \ther and Charlie.  \tPeggy onstage, eyes closed, swaying to the music. Walter and \tCarol join hands, walking towards the stage. Rosalie in her \twheelchair, doing the hand jive, crying.  \tThe entire crowd swaying to the music, looking to Peggy, \trepeating the chorus over and over.  \tBeth notices her mother's state of emotion. Peggy collapses \tonstage. We hear SHOUTS and SCREAMS. Richard, Arthur and \tseveral others crowd over Peggy. Beth rushes to the stage, \treaching out to her mother. Charlie too.  \n[69] \tCAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE Peggy lying on a cot. She wears \tthe same dress she had on at the reunion. She's terrified. \tWe NEAR a smattering of background noises: NAMES are CALLED, \tNURSES helping, etc. Looking up she sees: The IV.  \tThe NURSE taking the IV out of her arm, and placing a vial of \tblood on a tray with several others. Peggy sits up slowly, \tdazed and frightened. She looks at the nurse.  \n[70]\t\tCharlie! Am I dead?  \n[71]\t\tWhat's going on? Where am I?  \n[72]\t\tHow did I get here?  \tMaddy and Carol approach, carrying their books.  \n[73]\t\tNo thanks. I gave them up years \t\tago.  \tMaddy and Carol react as Peggy takes a closer look at herself \tand the girls' reflections. She places a hand to her throat, \tnoticing the locket is gone.  \n[74]\t\tWhere is it?  \n[75]\t\tMaddy, what did you do to your \t\thair?  \tMaddy looks in the mirror.  \n[76]\t\tThat's okay. I'm sure I'll remember \t\tthe way.  \n[77]\t\tYes. Let's stay in touch.  \tPeggy walks up to the door, a sleepwalker in suspended \tanimation. She waits a beat and knocks softly.  \n[78]\t\tPeggy. \t\t\t \t\tPeggy Sue.  \n[79]\t\t\t \t\tMom!  \n[80]\t\tI have a note.  \n[81]\t\tI'm excused.  \n[82]\t\tMom!  \tPeggy embraces her mother, holding on for dear life, inhaling \ther scent.  \n[83]\t\tChanel Number Five. That always \t\treminds me of home.  \n[84]\t\tI'm home now.  \n[85] \tPeggy enters warily, looking around, a fifties museum of \tteenage artifacts. She walks around the room gently touching \ther old belongings including the record player from opening \tscene. She looks in the mirror to make sure she's still \tthere. Suddenly, she turns around.  \n[86]\t\tOkay, I'm alone now. Is anyone \t\there?  \tShe opens the closet door expectantly, then closes it shaking \ther head.  \n[87]\t\tNo. This is crazy. Is somebody \t\tgoing to tell me what's going on? \t\tWhy me? What happened? You don't \t\thave to show up. I don't have to \t\tsee you. Just send me a sign. \t\t\t \t\tThanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my \t\town.  \tNANCY, Peggy's twelve\u0097year\u0097old sister, peeks in the room.  \n[88]\t\tNancy! Come here.  \tNancy tentatively approaches. Peggy hugs her.  \n[89]\t\tI'm just happy to see you.  \n[90]\t\tI'm sorry about that. I really want \t\tus to be closer. I have enough \t\tunresolved relationships in my... \t\tlife.  \n[91]\t\tLet's do something together.. Do \t\tyou want to play Monopoly? Or \t\tCareers... Clue... Snakes and \t\tLadders?  \n[92]\t\tIt's unbelievable. The man never \t\tages.  \n[93]\t\tDon't eat the red ones.  \n[94]\t\tThey're bad for you. They \t\tcause...red lips.  \tNancy react, as Peggy stands. CAMERA TRACKS HER to the den.  \n[95]\t\tCan't hurt. I'm already dead.  \tShe belts down several drinks.  \n[96] \tThe family admires a new red and white Edsel.  \n[97]\t\tOh, Daddy. You were always \t\tdoing things like that. \t\t\t \t\tThat's funny! That's really funny.  \tShe staggers over to the car and falls against it laughing. \tMr. Kelcher crosses to her and catches a whiff of her breath.  \n[98]\t\t\t \t\tJust a little. I've had a tough \t\tday.  \n[99]\t\t\t \t\tGrounded? Ha! The story of my life. \t\tI don't wanna go to my room. I \t\twanna import Japanese cars. I wanna \t\tgo to Liverpool and discover the \t\tBeatles.  \n[100]\t\tDad, I never knew you had a sense \t\tof humor.  \n[101] \tPeggy lies in bed, her mother tucking her in.  \n[102]\t\tOh Mom, I forgot you were ever so \t\tyoung.  \n[103] \tShe hears her mother walk down the stairs.  \n[104] \tPeggy emerges from the bathroom wearing a towel.  \n[105]\t\tLet's get physical!... Let's get \t\tmetaphysical!  \tNancy comes in dressed for school.  \n[106]\t\tGood morning.  \tNancy goes to Peggy's closet.  \n[107]\t\tYeah, but take good care of it.\tI'm \t\tsaving it for my daughter.. She \t\tloves this stuff.  \n[108]\t\tOh. I forgot.  \tMrs. Kelcher takes an elastic band from around the faucet and \thands it to Peggy as she sits at the table. Peggy makes a \tponytail.  \n[109]\t\tI'm still here, aren't I? \t\tI may as well enjoy myself. \t\tI'm going to go to school \t\ttoday. \t\t\t \t\tDad, I want to apologize for \t\tyesterday. The car is a classic. \t\tUse it in the best of health.  \n[110]\t\tThat would be impossible.  \n[111]\t\tMom, is there any coffee left?  \tMrs. Kelcher begins to pour the coffee, then pulls back, \tspilling some on Mr. Kelcher.  \n[112]\t\tOh.\tAh...recently. All the kids \t\tdrink it.  \n[113]\t\tI think I'm way ahead of them.  \n[114]\t\tYou know, you two are wonderful \t\tparents. I'm really going to try to \t\tbehave myself.  \n[115]\t\tMom, sit down for a minute. This is \t\tso nice, all of us being together \t\tagain like this.  \n[116]\t\tOh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to \t\thandle him?  \n[117]\t\tSort of.  \n[118]\t\tThe house payments.  \n[119]\t\tPretty strange.  \tPeggy hesitates, unsure how to handle her accumulated \tambivalence towards Charlie.  \n[120]\t\tNot now, Charlie. I've got a \t\theadache. Get used to the word. \t\tRoll it around your tongue for a \t\tyears.  \n[121]\t\tYou drive like a maniac!  \n[122]\t\tOh yeah?  \n[123]\t\tRefresh my memory.  \n[124]\t\tMaybe I blocked it out.  \n[125]\t\tWhy wait?  \n[126]\t\tThey'll learn to live with it.  \tPeggy exits the car and heads towards the school. Charlie \tsits, stunned.  \n[127]\t\tWould you?  \n[128]\t\tWhere's Rosalie Testa?  \n[129]\t\t\t \t\tTest?  \n[130]\t\t\t \t\tMr. Snelgrove, I happen to know \t\tthat in the future, I will never \t\thave the slightest use for algebra. \t\tAnd I speak from experience.  \tThe class gasps, a few students APPLAUD, and Mr. Snelgrove's \tjaw drops.  \n[131]\t\tMr. Gilfond, can I talk to you?  \n[132]\t\tI just wanted to tell you how much \t\tI enjoy your class. You taught me a \t\tlot and... you're a very fine \t\tteacher.  \n[133]\t\tThank you. Um, I also think you're \t\tunderpaid.  \n[134]\t\t\t \t\tWhat do you mean?  \n[135]\t\tArthur, please don't call me Peg.  \n[136]\t\tI don't get it.  \n[137]\t\tI'll be right back.  \n[138] \n[139]\t\tCongratulations on the math \t\tcontest, Richard.  \n[140]\t\tGet lost you macho shmuck.  \tDoug and Richard react.  \n[141]\t\tI have to talk to you. It's very \t\timportant.  \n[142]\t\tIt's not that. Can we meet after \t\tschool? Please?  \n[143]\t\tAll.... Okay. Sure.  \tPeggy walks to the front and faces the class, smiling primly.  \n[144]\t\tChoosing a good nursery school can \t\tbe one of the most important \t\tdecisions you can make. It will \t\toften determine your child's \t\tattitude towards education and \t\tschooling. \t\t\t \t\tOf course, the lessons learned are \t\tprimarily social \u0097\u0097 sharing, being \t\tconsiderate of others. \t\t\t \t\tAnd they're so cute when they're \t\tlittle. They bring you back their \t\tLittle masterpieces every day and \t\tyou put 'em on the refrigerator \t\tdoor. They're so proud, and their \t\tnames are all misspelled. Scott \t\twould always print his S backwards, \t\tand Beth would make her sweet \t\tlittle flowers...  \tPeggy wipes away a tear. At the stunned reaction of the class \tand Miss Otto.  \n[145]\t\tThanks.  \n[146]\t\tI thought it had a lot of merit.  \n[147]\t\tRejected, worthless, miserable.  \n[148]\t\tGood.  \tPeggy turns, and walks away. Charlie looks miserable.  \n[149]\t\tWhat a great kite.  \n[150]\t\tI want to ask you a question. \t\t\t \t\tDo you think...time travel is \t\tpossible?  \n[151]\t\tSort of.  \n[152]\t\tWhat's that?  \n[153]\t\tI\tknow what a burrito is.  \n[154]\t\tWhat's inside?  \n[155]\t\tSo you think time travel is \t\tpossible? For people?  \n[156]\t\tListen, you've gotta keep this a \t\tsecret. You can't tell a soul. \t\tPromise?  \n[157]\t\tThis is serious. Nobody can know. \t\tAh, I've returned from the future. \t\tI traveled back here 25 years.  \n[158]\t\tNo. Really. You're the smartest \t\tperson I know. It sounds \t\tunbelievable. But I can prove it.  \n[159]\t\tYou have a blind grandfather. One \t\tday you're going to invent a \t\tmachine that reads books for blind \t\tpeople. I read about it. You're \t\tgoing to be famous. You're going to \t\tinvent a lot of things.  \n[160]\t\tBecause I'm telling you the truth. \t\tI know what's going to happen. \t\tThere's going to be test tube \t\tbabies and heart transplants. And \t\tan American named Neil Armstrong is \t\tgoing to walk on the moon. On July \t\t20, 1969.  \n[161]\t\tI don't know.  \tOblivious, Peggy and Richard walk by Shower's Cafe. Inside, \tDolores and Carol see them.  \n[162]\t\tThat's why I was getting a \t\tdivorce.. \t\t\t \t\tWhat I really think is that I had a \t\theart attack at the reunion and \t\tdied.  \n[163]\t\tCome on, Richard, I'm serious.  \n[164]\t\tAm I dead or not?  \n[165]\t\tWhat're you doing?  \n[166]\t\tNo! I don't want to die!  \n[167]\t\tWhat if it's beyond science? What \t\tit it's God?  \n[168]\t\tI don't know.  \n[169]\t\tI told you, I've already lived my \t\tlife. I don't know how or why I'm \t\there, but you have to help me get \t\tback. I want to get back to my real \t\tlife!  \n[170]\t\tI'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. \t\t\t  \n[171] \tHer mother is sitting on the sofa with a strange MAN in a \tsuit. She's served him tea. There are several, pieces of old \tjewelry spread on a cloth on the coffee table. The man is \texamining one of the pieces. Mrs. Kelcher seems surprised \tthat Peggy's home from school.  \tPeggy moves on into the kitchen.  \n[172]\t\tWho was that man?  \n[173]\t\tIt was great to see everybody \t\tagain. But it's so boring and \t\tregimented. Most of what they teach \t\tis useless. The worst thing was \t\tlunch.  \tThe TELEPHONE RINGS.  \n[174]\t\tSure, Mom. \t\t\t \t\tHello.  \tPeggy gasps. Mrs. Kelcher turns to her.  \n[175]\t\t\t \t\tIt's Grandma. I can't talk to her \t\tnow. \t\t\t \t\tI'm sorry, Grandma.  \tPeggy hands the receiver to her mother and runs out of the \troom sobbing. Her first confrontation with mortality.  \n[176]\t\tI had a dream that Grandma died.  \n[177]\t\tShe did? I love her so much, and I \t\thaven't seen her in such a long \t\ttime. And Grandpa Barney. Is he \t\tall, right?  \n[178]\t\tI'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma \t\tback and apologize.  \n[179]\t\tI'm confused about a lot of things \t\tright now. Charlie's only one of \t\tthem.  \tTwo beats.  \n[180]\t\tWhat do you mean?  \n[181] \tPeggy is changing a record. She sees the dress she was \twearing the day before  slung across a \tchair. As Peggy picks it up, a book of matches falls out. \tPeggy picks it up, excited.  \tINSERT: MATCHBOOK which reads: FINISH HIGH SCHOOL IN YOUR \tSPARE TIME. Peggy frantically searches the dress pockets and \tslowly draws out two joints. She stares at them for a beat.  \n[182]\t\t\t \t\tOh, Beth.  \tThere's a knock at the door. Peggy quickly hides the joints. \tMrs. Kelcher opens the door.  \n[183]\t\tFor what?  \n[184]\t\tI don't feel very festive.  \n[185] \twalking downstairs, surprised by Charlie and Dad talking.  \n[186]\t\tWhere did you get that sweater?  \n[187]\t\tIt's really Fifties. You sort of \t\tclash with the world.  \n[188]\t\tRight. I promised my mother.  \n[189]\t\t\t \t\tCharlie, how are you?  \n[190]\t\tSeriously. What's it like to be \t\teighteen?  \tCharlie looks thoughtful, then guns the engine.  \n[191]\t\tHi, guys.  \n[192]\t\tWhy I oughta!  \tThe boys all crack up.  \n[193]\t\tYou know, I never could figure that \t\tone out.  \n[194]\t\tDon't get your hopes up.  \n[195]\t\tHe is kind of cute, isn't he?  \n[196]\t\tHe does?  \tThe group finishes the song. Charlie blows Peggy a kiss. The \tcrowd APPLAUDS, including Peggy. Dolores joins Peggy, Carol \tand Maddy.  \n[197]\t\tFirst of all, Richard is not a \t\tcreep. He happens to be an \t\texceptional person. If any of you \t\tgave him half a chance, you'd find \t\tthat out.  \n[198]\t\tDolores, can't you be a little \t\tkinder to people? You don't even \t\tknow the boy. If you weren't so \t\tneurotic and insecure, maybe you'd \t\tshut up for a while and show some \t\tcompassion.  \n[199]\t\tTouchy, touchy!  \tDolores storms away.  \n[200]\t\tCharlie, what do you think of \t\tRichard Norvik?  \n[201]\t\tHe's trying.  \n[202]\t\t\t \t\tCome on, let's dance.  \n[203]\t\tYou're pretty charming when you \t\twant to be.  \n[204]\t\tMmm. This is nice.  I always loved \t\tthe way you kiss.  I missed you.  \n[205]\t\tYou really love me, don't you?  \n[206]\t\t\t \t\tCharlie, let's make love.  \n[207]\t\tA lot's happened since last \t\tweekend.  \n[208]\t\t\t \t\tI probably meant it when I said it. \t\t\t \t\tDoesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come \t\tout?  \n[209]\t\tYou know. Your love machine... the \t\tthrobbing thrill hammer... your \t\tthing!  \n[210]\t\tThis is a mistake. We better \t\tforget it.  \n[211]\t\tI'm sorry Charlie.  \n[212]\t\tMonica? Aren't you Monica Hines?  \n[213]\t\tAh... never mind. Can I have a \t\tcoffee, please? And a cinnamon \t\tcruller. \t\t\t \t\tHow's Bobo?  \tPeggy notices Michael staring at her. Peggy smiles, Michael \tdoesn't. Monica brings Peggy her coffee and donut.  \n[214]\t\tYou're kidding?  \tPicking up her donut and coffee, she walks over to Michael's \ttable and sits opposite him.  \n[215]\t\tI was impressed with what you said \t\tin English class today.  \n[216]\t\tYou don't?  \n[217]\t\tMaybe you're confusing his life \t\twith his work.  \n[218]\t\tThe young man leaned back in his \t\tchair. No bulls would die today.  \n[219]\t\tCoffee and a donut.  \n[220]\t\tHey, man, I'm a hip chick.  \n[221]\t\tYeah. I'm surprised. It's really \t\told...  Travels well \t\tthough. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, the world looks a lot \t\tbetter from up here.  \n[222]\t\tWhat are you shooting for?  \n[223]\t\tDon't you get along with your \t\tparents?  \n[224]\t\tThey care about you. They're just a \t\tdifferent generation.  \n[225]\t\tI already did that. I want to be a \t\tdancer, I want to dance.  \tPeggy takes off her sweater, kicks off her shoes and begins \tto dance. Her eyes are closed, her body silhouetted by the \tmoon. Michael is transfixed. After a few beats, he walks over \tto her. He stretches out his arms and places them around her \tneck. They sway together for several beats, their bodies \ttouching. Peggy opens her eyes and sees Michael gazing at her \ttenderly.  \n[226]\t\tIs that one of your poems?  \n[227]\t\tI'd love to.  \n[228]\t\tMichael... you're as good as you \t\tlooked.  \tHis other hand reaches to undo her skirt.  \n[229]\t\tI envy you. You have your whole \t\tlife ahead of you and you know \t\texactly what you want to do. \t\t\t \t\tBut forget the rat puke; write \t\tsomething beautiful.  \tPeggy lies back down on the ground. Michael takes her hand \tand kisses it.  \n[230]\t\tYou know, this isn't really \t\thappening.  \tCAMERA PULLS BACK to include the entire, perfect tableau: the \tstarry night, the motorcycle, the clouds racing across the \tmoon and the two lovers on the mountaintop.  \n[231]\t\tThanks, Ralph.  \n[232]\t\tI went for a drive. Up in the \t\thills.  \n[233]\t\tIt's not Charlie. It's me.  \n[234]\t\tAt my age? Don't be silly.  \n[235]\t\tDad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't \t\tyou ever stay out all night when \t\tyou were young?  \n[236]\t\tCalm down. Just listen for a \t\tminute.. Please.  \n[237]\t\tI want to help with the family \t\tfinances. I want you to buy some \t\tstocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is \t\tgoing to be worth eight hundred \t\tdollars an ounce. Then you sell.  \n[238]\t\tI think they're going to deregulate \t\tit.  \n[239]\t\tOh boy, that's another thing that's \t\tgoing to change. Who's going to \t\tthink for us? Our husbands? You \t\tknow, you treat Mom like a maid. \t\tIt's not entirely your fault. Those \t\twere the attitudes in the fifties, \t\tand that's the way you raised me. \t\tBut give Nancy a break, encourage \t\ther to go to art school.  \n[240]\t\tListen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy \t\tPolaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, \t\tno. Not yet. Buy Xerox!  \n[241]\t\tWay to go, Mom!  \tThe Kelchers glare at each other~. We HEAR the DOOR SLAM.  \n[242]\t\tI'm just not the type. Besides, I \t\twant to get out of here.  \n[243]\t\tI tried to tell them, but they \t\twouldn't listen to me.  \n[244]\t\tRichard, take it easy.  \n[245]\t\tHow come you never ask me any \t\timportant questions? Don't you \t\twonder if there's going to be a \t\tnuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? \t\tWhat about your family? What about \t\tpeople?  \n[246]\t\tGive me some credit, will you?  \n[247]\t\tWbat're you talking about?  \n[248]\t\tSixty\u0097forty.  \n[249]\t\tOkay, find yourself another vision.  \n[250]\t\tWhen do we start?  \tA WAITRESS approaches their table.  \n[251]\t\tQuiche Lorraine, spinach salad and \t\ta Perrier.  \n[252]\t\tDry cleaners. No real change. Just \t\thigher prices.  \tThey move next door to a shoe store.  \n[253]\t\tAh. This is a biggie. Forget \t\tsneakers. Running shoes, jogging \t\tshoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two \t\thundred dollars a pair.  \n[254]\t\tThere are major fortunes to be made \t\there. Leisure time and life\u0097styles.  \n[255]\t\tNot for you. Okay, there's lots \t\tmore.  \tThey move along to the next window, an appliance store. The \twindow is filled with old televisions, record players, large \trotisserie\u0097broilers, etc. The store sign reads: BODELL'S TV \tAND APPLIANCES. Another sign reads: COME IN AND LISTEN TO \n[256]\t\tLook at that stuff. It's like the \t\tdark ages. This is more your speed. \t\tAnd boy, do I know this business.  \tPeggy peers into the store again and catches a g1impse of \tCharlie serving a customer.  \n[257]\t\tYou don't have to use pig Latin! \t\tNobody could possibly know what \t\twe're talking about.  \n[258]\t\tOh.\tAnd huge portable radios. \t\tEverything else gets small, but for \t\tsome reason, portable radios get \t\tenormous.  \tPeggy looks up and sees a lingerie store across the street. \tShe heads towards it, calling:  \n[259]\t\tI'll be right back.  \tPeggy enters the Lingerie store. After a beat, Peggy emerges \tfrom the store, excited and empty handed. Dodging traffic, \tshe hurries back to Richard.  \n[260]\t\tRichard! They don't have any! They \t\tnever heard of them! Isn't that \t\twonderful?  \n[261]\t\tThe wave of the future! I've \t\tdecided on our first fortune! I'll \t\tsee you later. You just think high \t\ttech.  \n[262]\t\tWoody! How ya doing?  \n[263]\t\tNice to see you.  \n[264]\t\tWhat do you know about classical \t\tmusic?  \n[265]\t\tCharlie. About last nights..  \n[266]\t\tBut I'm not. I'm a grown woman with \t\ta lifetime of emotional experiences \t\tyou couldn't possibly understand.  \n[267]\t\tWhy?  \tCharlie cups her face in his hands, pouring out his heart.  \n[268]\t\tWhat am I going to do with you?  \n[269]\t\tHi, Dad.  \n[270]\t\tOpen it.  \tHe opens the present.  Inside are a pair of miniature golf \tball cufflinks.  \n[271]\t\tI closed my Christmas club.  \n[272]\t\tI wanted to apologize for this \t\tmorning.  \n[273]\t\tQuiet today?  \n[274]\t\tThe hat business is in trouble.  \n[275]\t\tYes.  \n[276]\t\tBut when John F. Kennedy's elected \t\tPresident, men'1l stop wearing \t\thats.  \n[277]\t\t\t(gravely; closing her \t\teyes \t\tHe'll win.  \n[278]\t\tOf course, he'll love it. You're a \t\tterrific artist.  \tWe HEAR Mr. Kelcher arguing loudly from downstairs. The two \tgirls freeze.  \n[279] \tMrs. Kelcher moves around the room, closing the windows.  \n[280] \tWe HEAR the song \"Stranger in Paradise\" from Kismet on the \told black and white record player from opening scene. Peggy \tsits on the floor, surrounded by stockings, leotards and a \tsewing basket. She cuts the legs oft a pair of leotards. In \tone hand she holds up the top half of the leotards, in the \tother hand, a pair of nylon stockings.  \tWe HEAR a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Peggy pushes everything \tunder the bed as Maddy and Carol enter.  \n[281]\t\tOn what?  \n[282]\t\tShe's unbelievable. Who needs \t\tsatellites when we've got Dolores's \t\tmouth?  \n[283]\t\tDid you memorize the whole book or \t\tonly the good parts?  \n[284]\t\tYou're kidding...? Carol, you have \t\tbeautiful hair.  \n[285]\t\tHe's very interesting. For all his \t\tpretending to be a tough guy, he's \t\treally got the soul of a poet.  \n[286]\t\tThat loud\u0097mouthed little bitch~  \n[287]\t\tCool it kids. He's free to see \t\tother girls, if he wants.  \n[288]\t\tI'm not going to marry him. I just \t\twent out with him once. \t\t\t \t\tI know! Why don't we go to the \t\tmovies tonight. Just us girls. \t\tIt'll be fun.  \n[289]\t\tOkay. But let's have a girls night \t\tsoon. Maybe a pajama party.  \n[290]\t\tTa da! Pantyhose! The death of the \t\tgarter belt! Of course, once \t\tthey're manufactured they'll look \t\tbetter than this. What do you \t\tthink?  \n[291]\t\tInstead of a girdle. And light as a \t\tfeather.  \n[292]\t\tAnd we won't just sell them in \t\tdepartment stores. We'll market \t\tthem in drug stores and \t\tsupermarkets.  \n[293]\t\tYou need a partner. There's a \t\tfriend of mine at school whose \t\tfather makes seat covers for cars, \t\tMr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him \t\tand his family over for dinner \t\ttomorrow night.  \n[294]\t\tWe've got to move fast. This is an \t\tidea whose time has come.  \n[295]\t\tWrong, Dad. Your idea.  \n[296] \tA breeze blows through the open window Peggy sleeps fitfully, \ttossing off the covers. We HEAR NOISES from outside her \twindow. A figure appears outside and silently climbs into the \tbedroom. Peggy mumbles Charlie's name. The man walks over to \ther bed as Peggy reaches out for him, tenderly, as if they \twere still married.  \n[297]\t\tCharlie. I just had the strangest \t\tdream.  \n[298]\t\tWhat are you doing here?  \n[299]\t\tI bumped into him after you dropped \t\tme off Last night. I didn't feel \t\tlike going home, so we went for a \t\tride.  \n[300]\t\tYou know I never could stand your \t\tsarcasm.  \n[301]\t\tAnd why do you always refer to \t\tyourself in the third person, like \t\tNapoleon? How come it always turns \t\tinto an argument with you?  \n[302]\t\tCharlie,. I've been trying to \t\tpostpone this. But what's the \t\tpoint? It's over. \t\t\t \t\tI don't want to hurt you. This is \t\tvery hard for me. I'm doing this \t\tfor both of us. I really want you \t\tto be happy.  \n[303]\t\tThat won't make any difference. \t\tWe just can't live together. And \t\tyou had the nerve to drive up with \t\tthat bimbo Janet.  \n[304]\t\tI just can't trust you anymore.  \n[305]\t\tThat's just it. You can always get \t\tto me. There's this window in my \t\theart and every time I leave it \t\topen, you climb in. Unless I close \t\tit now, nothing's ever going to be \t\tdifferent!  \n[306]\t\tEverything. I have a good head for \t\tbusiness, I should be franchising \t\tthe bakery. And I want you to give \t\tme your word that whatever happens, \t\tyou'll go to college. And finish.  \n[307]\t\tI'm trying to save you years of \t\tfrustration... waiting for a big \t\tbreak... no. Waiting for that big \t\tdisappointment so you could blame \t\tit all on me.  \n[308]\t\t\t \t\tHello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue. \t\tMuch better. How are you? I'm very \t\tsorry about the other day.  \n[309]\t\t\t \t\tHi, Richard.  \n[310]\t\tJogging. I was running, now I'm \t\tjogging.  \n[311]\t\tYep. It's going to be a law. \t\t\t \t\tI broke up with Charlie last night.  \n[312]\t\tIt was an unfair fight. He didn't \t\thave a chance. I'm taking a real \t\tgamble. I loved him for a long, \t\tlong time.  \n[313]\t\tFor God's sake, forget the money! \t\tI'm going crazy! I'm a walking \t\tanachronism. I'm a puddle of deja \t\tI'm worried about my kids, Scott \t\tmust be scared to death, I think my \t\tdaughter's doing drugs again. I \t\tcan't have any fun here, I don't \t\thave that innocence any more. I \t\tcan't keep all this in anymore. I \t\tfeel Like I'm going to explode.  \n[314]\t\tLike what?  \n[315]\t\tWhat do you know about hypnosis?  \n[316]\t\tLook, I'm desperate. I'll try \t\tanything. But what if you can't \t\tsnap me out of it?  \n[317]\t\t\t \t\tPeggy Sue Kelcher. \t\t\t \t\tOr, Peggy Bodell. \t\t\t \t\tI'm not sure.  \n[318]\t\tAh..... they're very tiny... they \t\tlook like a fingernail made out of \t\tan erector set...  \n[319]\t\tI think it's called silicon. \t\tCharlie told me that.  \n[320]\t\tWe were lying in the sand. It was \t\tmy eighteenth birthday... We were \t\tso awkward... I would have married \t\thim anyway...  \tPeggy starts to shift in the chair. Her shorts hike up, her \tlegs spread slightly. This is not lost on Richard. Weird, \tguttural sounds begin to emanate from his throat.  \n[321]\t\tNo. The Pill will change all that. \t\tThen he wouldn't have blamed me. We \t\twere just too young.  \n[322]\t\tNo. The Pill will be for birth \t\tcontrol. But girls do like sex. \t\tMaybe not the first time.  \n[323]\t\tYes, every day. \t\t\t(taking her blouse off \u0097 \t\tgetting spaced) \t\tMaybe I shouldn't have worn that \t\tdress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. \t\tThat's why they made me Queen.  \tPeggy's meandering makes Richard nervous.  \n[324]\t\tI couldn't help it \u0097\u0097 I loved him.  \n[325]\t\tRichard! You should be ashamed of \t\tyourself.  \n[326]\t\tThat's just perfect isn't it? Did \t\tit work? Did you find out why I \t\tcame back?  \n[327]\t\tGod dammit! How'm I gonna got out \t\tof here?  \tPeggy grabs a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall.  \n[328]\t\tOh, go feel up your hamsters! I \t\thear rodents put out.  \tPeggy storms out.  \n[329]\t\tMom, how about a machine that's \t\tlike your blender, only it slices \t\tvegetables, kneads dough, chops \t\tmeat and even make fresh pasta?  \n[330]\t\tNo, just a friend of mine. I don't \t\tthink he Likes Jell\u0097O.  \n[331]\t\tYou know Mom, it's okay to have \t\tmale friends. Besides, it's over \t\twith me and Charlie.  \n[332]\t\tYeah, I know Peggy Sue gets \t\tmarried. Case closed. Period. Mom, \t\tif you could live your life over \t\tagain, would you do the same thing? \t\tGet married and settle down after \t\thigh school?  \n[333]\t\tWhy?  \n[334]\t\tIt's incredibly difficult to make \t\tmoney in the restaurant business. \t\tYou have to get up at five in the \t\tmorning to go to the market, you \t\thave problems with spoilage, \t\temployee pilferage, and just try \t\tand collect from the credit card \t\tcompanies. They take months to pay.  \tThe whole table is astonished.  \n[335]\t\tOh, I just picked it up from my \t\tdad. He's a wonderful businessman.  \n[336]\t\tI shouldn't have put you through \t\tthat. It must have been agony. \t\tLet's do something.  \tMichael makes a move towards Peggy, with lust in his eyes.  \n[337]\t\tNo. Something else. I'm too full. \t\tBesides, it's a school night.  \n[338]\t\t\t(looking around at the \t\tcrowd \u0097 clinking glasses \t\tFor everyone.  \n[339]\t\tUtah? I thought you'd be going to \t\tNew York or Paris. What's in Utah?  \n[340]\t\t\t \t\tI can't do that.  \n[341]\t\tI hate chickens.  \n[342]\t\tMichael, you and I are light years \t\tapart. You should go, but not with \t\tme.  \n[343]\t\tThat's a terrific line. You're \t\tgoing to be a wonderful writer.  \n[344]\t\tYes. We had a glorious night \t\ttogether. One day you'll remember \t\tand write about it.  \n[345] \n[346]\t\tIt's Charlie!  \n[347]\tMICHAEL. Michael observes Peggy's intimate reaction to \tCharlie's singing.  \n[348]\t\tSsh. He's great.  \n[349]\t\tI thought I knew everything about \t\thim.  \n[350]\t\tWhat?  \n[351]\t\tHow did it go with the pantyhose?  \n[352]\t\tOh no!  \n[353]\t\tHe's a liar! He has no such thing! \t\tIt's my own fault. I should have \t\thad it patented first. He's a \t\tcrook, damnit.  \n[354]\t\tOh, you're both so naive.  \n[355] \t  \tPeggy lies in bed in the darkness, her eyes wide open. The \tbedside clock reads: 2:47. Peggy gets out of bed.  \tCAMERA TRACKS Peggy into Nancy's room. Peggy looks down at \tNancy sleeping. Gently pulling back the blankets, Peggy gets \tinto bed with her.  \n[356]\t\tI wanted to talk to you, and I have \t\tone last thing to take care of at \t\tschool. Then I'm going to... \t\t\t \t\tGood dog, Rusty. Good dog.  \n[357]\t\tOh. I guess I always liked Rusty \t\tbetter. \t\t\t \t\tCould you give me a ride to school?  \n[358]\t\tWell, how about a walk, Charlie \t\tBell..  \n[359]\t\tI was at Lena's last night. You \t\twere terrific.  \n[360]\t\tWhat were You doing there? You \t\tnever told me you were singing with \t\tan R and B group.  \n[361]\t\tI'd forgotten how much music meant \t\tto you.  \n[362]\t\tStop being defensive. I want to \t\thelp you. I wrote a song for you.  \n[363]\t\tNot exactly, but with your great \t\tvoice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.  \n[364]\t\tJust take a look at it. \t\t\t  \n[365]\t\tIt means I care about you and what \t\thappens to you.  \n[366]\t\tWhat's the matter?  \n[367]\t\tWhat happened?  \n[368]\t\tWelcome to the singles' scene.  \n[369]\t\tLook, Carol, maybe Walter's done \t\tyou a big favor. You always said \t\tyou wanted to get out of town. Go \t\tfor it. And be happy, goddamnit, \t\tI'm rooting for you.  \n[370]\t\tYou know Dolores, there's a lot of \t\tthings I could say to you, but \t\tyou're not worth the effort.  \tPeggy reaches down to\tup her books. On the top of the pile is \tan open fountain pen, which she picks up, pul1ing the release \tlever, squirting ink all over Dolores's dress. Dolores drops \ther books, looks down at her dress, horrified.  \n[371]\t\tSorry. These fountain pens are so \t\ttricky.  \n[372]\t\tI beg your pardon?  \n[373]\t\tHave a nice day.  \n[374]\t\tRosalie! Wait!  \tRosalie turns at the door, smiling. They are alone.  \n[375]\t\tI think you should give up diving. \t\tIt's dangerous.  \n[376]\t\tI know you are, but you have to \t\tstop. I couldn't tell you before, \t\tI didn't know if I should. But you \t\thave to stop before you hurt \t\tyourself.  \n[377]\t\tBut accidents can happen.  \n[378]\t\tRosalie, please, listen to me! You \t\thave to stop.  \n[379]\t\tIt's all, gone wrong, nothing's \t\tworking out.  \n[380]\t\tYou were meant to. You're one of \t\tthose fortunate people that good \t\tthings happen to. I have to get out \t\tof here.  \tShe starts to walk away.  \n[381]\t\tI love you too, Richard. Thanks for \t\ttrying.  \tShe continues down the hallway.  \n[382]\t\tForget it, it'll never work.  \n[383]\t\tThank you.  \n[384]\t\t\t \t\tFine. \t\t\t ) \t\tGrandma, would you teach me how to \t\tmake strudel?  \n[385]\t\tI wish she hadn't.  \n[386]\t\tDo you believe in all of that?  \n[387]\t\tI remember that book! \t\t\t \t\tGrandpa, Grandma, I want to tell \t\tyou something.  \n[388]\t\tBut I'm remembering the future.  \n[389]\t\tMy children make me happy. I miss \t\tthem so much. \t\t\t \t\tBeth. Scott and Beth. \t\t\t \t\tI'm going to name my daughter after \t\tyou.  \n[390]\t\tThat never changes. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, when you and Grandma are \t\tgone, the family's gone. I never \t\tsee the cousins anymore.  \n[391]\t\tGrandpa, if you had a chance to do \t\tit all again, what would you do?  \n[392]\t\tIt was my idea, Grandma. I always \t\twondered what went on at those \t\tlodge meetings.  \n[393]\t\t\t \t\tGood\u0097bye, Grandma.  \n[394]\t\tWhat does Grandma think you do at \t\tyour meetings?  \n[395]\t\tI hope so. At least I got to see \t\tyou and Grandma. \t\t\t \t\tHas it ever worked before?  \n[396]\t\tThank you.  \n[397]\t\tAh... thank you.  \n[398]\t\t\t \t\tDo you have to wear that hat?  \n[399]\t\tYes, sir.  \tLeo steps back, closes his eyes and spreads his arms.  \n[400]\t\tFasten your seat belts. Here we go.  \n[401]\t\t\t \t\tThis is never going to work.  \tThe old men form a circle in front of Peggy. They begin to \tcircumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads \tbowed. As Barney passes in front of Peggy, he winks at her. \tShe smiles back.  \n[402]\t\tWhat the hell did you do that for? \t\tWhat are you doing here?  \n[403]\t\tDon't be ridiculous! They're just a \t\tbunch of harmless old men. My \t\tgrandfather was in there.  \n[404]\t\tI'm not getting in that blue \t\tmonstrosity.  \tCharlie pushes her inside, Peggy climbs back out. Charlie \ttakes her hand and drags her up a hill behind the lodge hall.  \n[405]\t\tLet me got! Where are you taking \t\tme?  \n[406]\t\tHow could you possibly know what \t\tI've been going through?  \tThunder and lightning. It starts to rain.  \n[407]\t\tWhat do you mean you and my father \t\tdecided? Who the hell are you to \t\tplan my life? Let's get married and \t\tlive happily ever after. Bullshit. \t\tI got knocked up. I had to marry \t\tyou. I never had a choice.  \n[408]\t\tYou betrayed me, Charlie. You were \t\tnever there for me or the children. \t\tAnd now you come and tell me, \t\t\"Peggy, you're scared.\" Of course \t\tI'm scared. If you knew what I knew \t\tyou'd be scared shitless.  \n[409]\t\tI might be crazy, but I'm not crazy \t\tenough to marry you twice. There's \t\ta lot of things I can't change. I \t\tcan't even think about them. I \t\ttried. But I couldn't even help \t\tRosalie. \t\t\t \t\tI don't want to be bitter. I'm a \t\tnaturally optimistic person. But \t\tyou took advantage of that.  \tCharlie bends down to comfort her, in tears. He hugs Peggy \tand strokes her hair.  \n[410]\t\tWill you take me back to my \t\tgrandparents?  \n[411]\t\t\t \t\tOh, Charlie.  \n[412]\t\tScott and Beth. Where did you get \t\tthese?  \n[413]\t\tSo are Scott and Beth.  \tPeggy leans into Charlie, throwing her arms around him, \tholding on for dear life. She looks up at him, their \tforeheads touching.  \n[414]\t\tI know.  \tCharlie kisses her, passionately. The locket drops to the \tground. HOLD on the locket, and...  \n[415]\t\t\t \t\tDo you think anybody in the Fifties \t\tever made love on a bed?  \n[416]\t\tI've got to go now.  \n[417]\t\tI'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll \t\tlove you for twenty years.  \n[418]\t\tI'm trying.  \tAs Charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning \tstrikes his car. Peggy smiles. The men from the lodge run \toutside. They look up and above the blazing car and see Peggy \tfloating away. Peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and \tblows him a kiss. Charlie begins to run, following the kite \tcord to its source. He finds Richard, struggling to restrain \tthe runaway kite.  \n[419]\t\tCharlie? Was I dead?  \n[420]\t\t\t \t\tYou look awful, like you haven't \t\tslept in days. And so old.  \n[421]\t\tCharlie, I thought I knew \t\teverything about you.  \n[422]\t\tWhat about Janet?  \n[423]\t\tWho are all the flowers from?  \tCharlie pushes himself out of his chair and moves toward the \tdresser.  \n[424]\t\tIt couldn't be me.  I hardly knew \t\thim.  \n[425]\t\tCharlie, I had a strange \t\texperience.  I went back to high \t\tschool. And I spent a lot of time \t\twith you.  And you and Walter and \t\tLeon were singing \"I Wonder Why\".  \n[426]\t\tYou were terrific.  And I kept \t\ttrying to push you away but you \t\twouldn't give up.  \n[427]\t\tThen hold me.  \tHe holds her hand.  \n[428]\t\tDon't try to charm me, Charlie \t\tBodell.  \n[429]\t\tCharlie, I would like to invite you \t\tto dinner at home, on Sunday, with \t\tyour kids. I will make a strudel.  \tHe hurries back to her, kisses her again.  \tThey hang on to each other as Beth enters the room.  \n[430] </div>  \tTo be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the \tgoodbye to Richard scene.  \n[431]\t\tI came to say goodbye.  \n[432]\t\tYou were meant to  You're one of \t\tthose fortunate people that good \t\tthings happen to.  \n[433]\t\t\t \t\tVision?

I'm sorry to hear that.  \tNEW VIEW \u0097 A large, beefy HAND is THRUST INTO FRAME.  \n[6]\t\tThank you, Doug.  \n[7]\t\t...fifth generation core capacities \t\tare going to cause another \t\tshake\u0097out in the smaller companies.  \n[8]\t\tSure. I remember you.  \n[9]\t\tAre we through Dolores? Good.  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\tYou'll be okay?  \n[11]\t\tThe only time people like Dolores \t\tused to pay any attention to me was \t\tto laugh at me or insult me. That \t\tguy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand \t\twhen we walked in, he used to call \t\tme a four\u0097eyed worm.  \n[12]\t\tYou were always friendly to me. I \t\tappreciated that. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, this used to be a fantasy \t\tof mine.  \n[13]\t\tDancing with you.  \n[14]\t\tI guess part of us never really \t\tleaves high school.  \n[15]\t\tSharon and I thank you all for \t\tmaking us feel so welcome. It's \t\tgood to be back.  \tMORE APPLAUSE as Richard steps back.  \n[16] \n[17]\t\tIt really wasn't that difficult.  \tDoug Snell  walks past.  \n[18]\t\tI'm not doing any tutoring this \t\tyear. I'm too busy.  \n[19]\t\tAll right. I'll be in the physics \t\tlab. Make it four\u0097thirty. I have a \t\trocket club meeting.  \n[20]\t\tI'm writing a book on kite \t\tconstruction. What did you want to \t\ttalk about?  \n[21]\t\tAre you doing some kind of science \t\tproject?  \n[22]\t\tWell... in a Newtonian framework, \t\tthe possibilities were limited, but \t\twith the advent of relativity \t\ttheory, the idea of absolute time \t\tcan no longer be reasonably \t\taffirmed.  \tPeggy hasn't understood a word.  \n[23]\t\tAnd then, there's Richard's \t\tBurrito.  \n[24]\t\tThat's my own theory based on a \t\tMexican food called the burrito. \t\tI had it once when my parents took \t\tme to Disneyland.  \n[25]\t\tWell, I think time is like a \t\tburrito. Sometimes it just folds \t\tover on itself and one part touches \t\tthe other.  \n[26]\t\tYou can till it with whatever you \t\twant. From illusions to memory, \t\tfrom experience to innocence, from \t\thappiness to the entire universes  \n[27]\t\tAbsolutely. People, dogs, \t\telephants.  \n[28]\t\tOkay. I promise.  \n[29]\t\tYou probably are crazy. Wait a \t\tminute. Is this some kind of joke? \t\tI know what you all, think of me.  \n[30]\t\tOh yeah?  \n[31]\t\tHow, did you know about my \t\tgrandfather?  \n[32]\t\tHoly Toledo! That's six years \t\tahead of schedule!  \n[33]\t\tBut when did you leave? Are you \t\there until then? Were you there \t\tuntil now? What direction are you \t\tgoing in? Are you a moving point on \t\tan infinite line extending into the \t\tpast? Can anyone do it?  \n[34] \n[35]\t\tI'd be very careful if I were you. \t\tYou don' t want to fall into the \t\tclutches of some madman with plans \t\tto manipulate your brain.  \n[36] \n[37]\t\tYou look pretty good for a corpse.  \n[38]\t\tYou're giving me the creeps.  \n[39]\t\tThere's one way to find out.  \tRichard stops and throws down his books. He steps in front of \tPeggy, throwing down her books, dragging her to the curb.  \n[40]\t\tConfucious says, The way out is \t\tthrough the door. There's a truck. \t\tThere's your door.  \tA large truck speeds towards them.  \n[41]\t\tStep in front of the truck! If \t\tyou're dead, it won't matter. The \t\ttruck'll go right through you. Go \t\tahead! You're dead!  \tPeggy takes one step off the curb. The truck is getting \tcloser. The truck BLOWS A LOUD SUSTAINED WAIL.  \n[42] \tA completely outfitted laboratory, kites decorate the walls.  \n[43]\t\tOkay, you're not dead, but \t\taccording to every law of science \t\twhat you say happened to you is \t\timpossible.  \n[44]\t\tYou're a molecule in chaos, a \t\tdiscontinuent aberration. Maybe \t\tyou've just got powers of \t\tprecognition. Well, maybe you're \t\tjust out of whack.  \n[45]\t\tAll right, I'll work on it, I'll, \t\tdo some research. But in the \t\tmeantime, don't get crazy.  \n[46]\t\tWhat if you're not here tomorrow?  \n[47]\t\tThe way I see it, you have an \t\tunparalleled opportunity to become \t\tthe richest woman in the world.  \n[48]\t\tBut you have a vision. Don't you \t\twant to help your parents?  \n[49]\t\tI'm talking about invention, no \t\tinvestment. I know what people \t\tthink of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick \t\tthe Square Root. I'll show them. \t\tYou said I was going to be a \t\tmillionaire. And you're gonna help!  \n[50]\t\tNo offense, but for a person who \t\tsays she's lived an extra lifetime, \t\tyou certainly are thick. Money is \t\tpower.. Money makes people respect \t\tyou...  \n[51]\t\tI'm curious, but I don't want to \t\tknow. Jeez, I hope you haven't been \t\ttelling people what's going to \t\thappen to them.  \n[52]\t\tGood. You're discreet. I like that \t\tin a partner.  \n[53]\t\tLook it's very simple. You tell me \t\teverything that hasn't been \t\tinvented yet, and I'll invent it. \t\tWe'll be partners. Fifty\u0097fifty.  \n[54]\t\tYou're taking advantage of a minor.  \n[55]\t\tA Ton on a Bun, with fries.  \n[56]\t\tCome on. You can't be serious.  \n[57]\t\tAre you talking ~about exercise? \t\tLike gym?  \n[58]\t\tLet's see... \t\t\t \t\ticrowavemays, ocketpay \t\talculatorcays...  \tThe two ladies react.  \n[59]\t\tAll right. These are the choices: \t\tmicrowave ovens, pocket \t\tcalculators, Walkmans, digital \t\twatches and miniature TV's.  \n[60]\t\tWhat are you talking about?  \n[61]\t\tHigh tech. I like the sound of \t\tthat.  \n[62] \tPeggy jogs towards Richard. He is watering the front lawn.  \n[63]\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[64]\t\tThat's what you were talking about \t\tyesterday? Everybody does that in \t\tthe future?  \n[65]\t\tThat's terrific. You did it. You \t\treally changed the course of your \t\tdestiny.  \n[66]\t\tCheer up. Now you can give some \t\tother guy a shot. Make it up to him \t\tlater and buy him a yacht.  \n[67]\t\tLook, the best scientific mind in \t\tthis country is working on your \t\tcase. May I make a suggestion?  \n[68]\t\t\t \t\tSuggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! \t\tWhy didn't I think o~ that before?  \n[69]\t\tEverything. This is perfect. The \t\tsubconscious mind remembers all. \t\tYou can give me more information on \t\tmicrochips and then pinpoint what \t\thappened at the reunion. Maybe \t\tthat'll give us a clue on how to \t\tget you back.  \n[70]\t\tNo offense, but you're pretty out \t\tof it now.  \n[71] \tPeggy sits in an old recliner. Richard holds a small, \tbattery\u0097operated revolving disc up in front of Peggy's closed \teyes, then puts it down and picks up a notepad and pen.  \n[72]\t\tYou are completely relaxed. When I \t\tcount to three, you will open your \t\teyes. One... two... three. \t\t\t(Peggy's eyes flutter \t\topen \t\tWe'll start with something easy. \t\tWhat is your name?  \n[73]\t\tOh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?  \n[74]\t\tWhat will they be made of?  \n[75]\t\tSilicon is from sand.  \n[76]\t\tIn the future, will you have to \t\tmarry a girl before you have sex \t\twith her?  \n[77]\t\tYou mean you'll give a girl a pill \t\tand she'll want to have sex?  \n[78]\t\tWill you take of f your blouse?  \n[79]\t\t\t \t\tNo! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. \t\t\t \t\tOh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap \t\tyou out of it.  \n[80]\t\tOne... two... three. \t\t\t \t\tYou are now awake.  \tRichard kneels on top of Peggy as she wakes up, fumbling the \tbuttons at her breasts. Peggy comes to, as Richard jumps off. \tShe buttons her blouse, furious.  \n[81]\t\tMe? You went crazy! You started \t\ttaking your clothes off. I was \t\tputting them back on for you.  \n[82]\t\tI think it has something to do with \t\tyour birthday. You were rambling. I \t\tdidn't understand the rest.  \n[83]\t\tHey! Do you have any idea how much \t\tthose beakers cost? I usually \t\tcharge for hypnosis.  \n[84]\t\tWhat's the matter?  \n[85]\t\tNot true.  I think I'm making real \t\tprogress on the microchip.  \n[86]\t\tPeggy, I believe you. I believe \t\teverything you told me. It's \t\twonderful. You're the exception \t\tthat proves the rule.  \tShe kisses him on the forehead.  \n[87]\t\tI can't! It's out of control!  \tSuddenly the cord breaks. Peggy floats away.  \n[88] </div>  \tTo be inserted after Dolores/Peggy scene and to replace the \tgoodbye to Richard scene.  \n[89]\t\tYou know, Peggy, there's so many \t\tthings to look forward to in the \t\tfuture.  \tPeggy leans over and kisses him, sadly, on the forehead.  \n[90]\t\tGoodbye? Where're you going? What \t\tabout our partnership? I'm making \t\treal progress with the microchip.  \n[91]\t\tSo are you. You've got a vision.  \n[92]\t\tDid you break up with Charlie?  \n[93]\t\tOkay. Why don't we do something \t\tvisionary. Change your destiny, \t\tPeggy Sue. Change your destiny and \t\tmarry me.  \n[94]\t\tWait! I'll go with you!  ", "Norvik": "", "Michael": "\n[1]\t\tSantiago comes back, with nothing \t\t\u0097 there's no meat on the bone. It's \t\tHemingway's ego defending itself \t\tagain; he's trying to prove he can \t\tstill perform.  \n[2]\t\tGilfond's okay, except he thinks \t\tHemingway's great Literature.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tHe's a fisherman! The most \t\toverrated writer of the century. I \t\tmean, he's the perfect American \t\tauthor \u0097 fat, violent, drunk...  \n[4]\t\tA writer's life is his work. Jack \t\tKerouac doesn't have to kill a bull \t\tto have something to write about. \t\tHe's out there feeling, burning... \t\tgrooving on life!  \tMichael leans back in his chair. He's said his piece. Peggy \tstudies him for a beat.  \n[5]\t\tWhat're you doing here anyway?  \n[6]\t\tI thought chicks like you traveled \t\tin packs.  \n[7]\t\tThis is great reefer.  \n[8]\t\tThe world is fantastic.

I'm gonna check out of this \t\tbourgeois motel. Push myself away \t\tfrom the dinner table and say 'No \t\tmore Jell\u0097O for me, Mom.'  \n[10]\t\tThe only thing my father digs is \t\tcold, green money. All my mother \t\tcares about is her standing at the \t\tcountry club.  \n[11]\t\tHey what's with you? I thought you \t\twere cool. You rode my bike. You \t\tblew some pot. \t\t\t \t\tWhat's your scene Miss Majorette? \t\tYou gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and \t\tgraze around with all the other \t\tsheep for the rest of your life?  \n[12]\t\tYou know, I had you pegged all \t\twrong.  \tMichael kisses Peggy. She responds passionately.  \n[13]\t\tA ray of oneness piercing the \t\tsolitude. Falling bodies in the \t\tecstasy of flesh. You'll be a \t\tchapter in my memoirs of desire.  \n[14]\t\tNo, I just made that up. Do \t\tyou want to hear one?  \n[15]\t\t\t \t\tOkay. Here's a new one. It's called \t\tTenderness. \t\t\t \t\tI couldn't sleep so I thought I'd \t\tscream \t\tBetrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of \t\tbitterness. \t\tIn the madhouse of Dr. Dread \t\tRazor shreds of rat puke fall \t\tOn my bare arms \t\t\t(sees Peggy grimace; he \t\tcalms down \t\tI'm sorry.

That's Yeats.  \tPeggy is moved by the beauty of the poem. She sits up, leans \tover Michael, runs her hand through his hair, almost \tmotherly.  \n[17]\t\tThat was quite an evening. \t\tBourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.  \n[18]\t\tFive more weeks of school. And ten \t\tminutes past graduation I'm gone. \t\t\t \t\tTo freedom.  \n[19]\t\tNow listen, this is the plan. As \t\tsoon as school is finished we go to \t\tUtah and...  \n[20]\t\tRita. I met her last summer. She's \t\tcool. You'll really dig her. She's \t\tgot this great little cabin in the \t\thills, just outside of Provo where \t\tshe raises chickens. I'll write and \t\tthe two of you can take care of the \t\tchickens to support us.  \n[21]\t\tWhy not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.  \n[22]\t\tBut what about the other night? We \t\twere like two stars in the same \t\tconstellation.  \n[23]\t\tBut we had heat baby. Passion! \t\tFire! We owe it to ourselves to \t\tfuse together. \t\t\t \t\tAt least one more time.  \n[24]\t\tYou think so?  \n[25]\t\tI can dig that. Bittersweet \t\tperfection. Dogs of lust on leashes \t\tof memory... yeah.  \tSuddenly distracted by the familiar voice, Peggy looks up to \tthe stage and sees that the lead singer, Charlie Bell, is in \tfact, Charlie Bodell.  \n[26]\t\tWhat a treat.  \n[27]\t\tNow I get it.  \n[28]\t\tPeggy Sue's still stuck on treble \t\twithout a cause.  \tCharlie finishes the song as the audience goes wild. He \tbeams.  \n[29]\t\tCan we split now?  \tPeggy and Michael unobtrusively slip out of the club. Charlie \tleaves the stage. He's met by a greasy looking MAN. They sit \tdown at a booth to talk.  \n[30]\t\tI can dig you being uptight about \t\tRita and Utah. That's cool. \t\tBut I've got to warn you about \t\tsomething.  \n[31]\t\tMy father.

In all \t\tthat time, haven't you at least \t\ttried another hair style?  \tPeggy tries to laugh off her embarrassment.  \n[3]\t\tYou're probably the only one who \t\tcould carry it off.  \n[4]\t\tWho's the mother around here?  \n[5]\t\tEveryone's got a gold Rolex.

I thought you had a \t\tpretty good marriage.  \n[8]\t\tSo he started having affairs, and \t\tyou got depressed.  \tPeggy nods.  \n[9]\t\tYou should have left here years \t\tago, like I did.  \n[10]\t\tAfter you got knocked up, my mother \t\tdidn't want me to talk to you.

They all \twear black pants and iridescent sharkskin jackets. Charlie is \tin the center of the group as they position themselves.  ", "Barney": "\n[1]\t\tHello, Lilla!  \n[2]\t\tQuite a bit more rain than usual \t\tthis year. I hope it doesn't spoil \t\tthe rhubarb.  \n[3]\t\tWhat's the matter, Lilla? Somebody \t\tjump on your grave?  \tPeggy shivers again and shakes her head.  \n[4]\t\tWhat's it going to be, Elizabeth? \t\tSeventy\u0097five? Eighty?  \n[5]\t\tI've been trying to drag it out of \t\ther for years. \t\t\t \t\tYou know, dreams are fascinating \t\tbusiness. 'Specially where you see \t\tthe future.  \n[6]\t\tWell, I like to speculate. This \t\tbook I'm reading right now, a woman \t\tin Colorado says she lived in \t\tIreland a hundred and fifty years \t\tago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- \t\tand she gives names and dates and \t\twhere she lived. She was \t\thypnotized. Big bestseller.  \n[7]\t\tIt's gonna rain again. Every \t\ttime I wash the car, it rains.  \n[8]\t\tIt's your grandma's strudel that's \t\tkept this family together.  \n[9]\t\t\t \t\tI'd take better care of my teeth.  \n[10]\t\tIt's her 18th birthday, I want to \t\tshow her off.  \tBarney turns and winks at Peggy.  \n[11]\t\tLet's go.  \n[12]\t\tStag movies. Smokers.  \tPeggy chuckles as they get into the car. The car proceeds \talong the driveway and turns onto the highway.  \n[13]\t\tI may be an old fool, but I think \t\twe can help you.  \n[14]\t\tThe last one was six hundred years \t\tago. It's about time for another \t\tone.  \n[15]\t\tLet me take your jacket, Lilla. \t\tI've got, to get my robe.  \tPeggy hands him her jacket as he heads over to the cloak, \troom.  \n[16]\t\tIt wouldn't be a lodge without \t\thats.  \tBarney takes her hand and squeezes it. They walk slowly \tthrough the doorway.  \n[17]\t\tDon't you worry. I'll be watching \t\tafter you.  ", "Evelyn": "", "Charlie": "\n[1]\t\tHi this is Charlie and... \t\tCome on, say your name.  \n[2]\t\tAnd we're here on the couch...  \n[3]\t\tWe're here on the sofa bed...  \n[4]\t\t...to record how much we love each \t\tother. Sitting beside me is the \t\tcutest majorette in the history of \t\tthe world. And she would Like to \t\tsay something.  \tA real estate agent, a WOMAN, carries a \"For Sale\" sign to \tthe center of the lawn and begins driving it in with a \thammer.  \n[5]\t\tCome on Peggy. Say what we \t\trehearsed.  \n[6]\t\tBut you love me don't you?  \n[7]\t\tAnd nothing will ever change that.  \tCharlie starts giggling. We HEAR fumbling and tickling.  \tCLOSE VIEW INTO THE KITCHEN - First we see a woman's hand, on \tthe floor. It is partially covered with flour.  \tMOVING VIEW reveals PEGGY BODELL, in her early 40's, fainted \tfrom heartbreak while baking a cake. Flour is scattered on \tthe floor. She recovers from her faint. Confused, she \tsteadies herself and brushes the flour from her dress.  \n[8]\t\tOh, gotta go. Here's a little \t\tmake\u0097out music.  \tA record starts: \"You Belong to Me\" by the Duprees.  \n[9] \tCHARLIE BODELL, early 40's, singing the same song. He can't \thit a high note, turns off the water and steps out of the \tshower. JANET, his young, buxom girlfriend is in the bedroom.  \n[10]\t\tGoddamnit, I just can't hit those \t\thigh notes anymore.  \n[11]\t\tDid I hear 70 dollars? What do you \t\tneed 50 dollars for? How's your \t\tMom?  \tPeggy comes out of the kitchen. Charlie has stopped \tconspicuously at the threshold. A workman comes from behind \tPeggy.  \n[12]\t\tFrank, watch the clock.  \tPeggy looks outside.  \n[13]\t\tCome off it, Peggy. And what do you \t\tmean your house? This is my house. \t\tI paid for it, I'm still paying for \t\tit.  \n[14]\t\tI mailed it to you on Wednesday.  \n[15]\t\tJesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not \t\tused to that stuff. You always did \t\tthe bills. Blame the damn post \t\toffice.  \tA workman approaches carrying an old mono record player: \tblack and white, a real fifties artifact. For a moment their \tmutual resentment melts, as they look at each other.  \n[16]\t\tYou got a Tab?  \n[17]\t\tYou don't want them? They're going \t\tto make a big comeback any minute. \t\tMark my words, these lamps are \t\tgoing to...  \n[18]\t\tI'll think of a way to sell, them. \t\t\t \t\tOne day.  \tPeggy opens a box filled with records. She closes it and \tmoves to another. Charlie checks the contents of another box \ton the other side of the room.  \n[19]\t\tI'm not going.  \tScott calls from the top of the stairs.  \n[20]\t\tBe right there. I'll go through the \t\trest of this stuff next weekend.  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tI never thought it would go \t\tthis far.  \tCharlie exits. Peggy looks around. She slaps the flap of a \tbox down, to close it, but it jumps back up.  \n[22]\t\tThanks.  \tCharlie grabs a cookie and puts it on the table in front of \thim, smashing it with his fist. He picks up and reads the \tfortune:  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\tNext week you'll be selling Sanyo \t\tremote control VCRs for three \t\thundred and ninety\u0097nine dollars? Oh \t\tno! \t\t\t \t\tCrazy Charlie...  \tHe grabs and smashes another fortune cookie.  \n[24]\t\tYou'll give away Mitsubishi giant \t\tscreen TVs for twelve hundred and \t\tninety\u0097five dollars! Oh no! I'll go \t\tbroke! \t\t\t \t\tCrazy Charlie...  \tHe grabs and smashes another cookie.  \n[25]\t\tYou won't be undersold on stereos, \t\tvideos, microwaves or blenders! \t\t\t \t\tCrazy Charlie, Crazy Charlie, \t\tI'm not breaking cookies, \t\tI'm smashing prices. \t\t\t(rolling his eyes like \t\tFabian \t\tCrazy Charlie, he insane.  \tThe waiter hits a big gong.  \tBeth laughs.  \n[26] \tAt opposite ends of the reunion, but aware of each other.  \n[27]\t\tI vant to suck your blood. I also \t\tvant to suck your Twinkie.  \n[28]\t\tNo. You are the undead. You will \t\tlive forever if you give me your \t\tTwinkie. \t\t\t \t\tCome on, let's have it. You hate \t\tthem anyway.  \tMechanically, Peggy hands over the Twinkie. Charlie bends \tover to nuzzle her neck. The nurse's hand COMES INTO FRAME \tand grabs Charlie by the scruff of the neck, pulling him up.  \n[29]\t\tHey! I just made a deposit in your \t\tblood bank. Now I want to make a \t\twithdrawal.  \n[30]\t\tI'm changing banks!  \tCharlie walks away towards Walter and Arthur. Peggy gazes \tafter him, his body blocking her view of a portion of a \tbanner hung on the wall. It reads: \"Support the Buchanan High \tBlood Drive...\" As Charlie exits, the final words come into \tview:  \t\"Spring 1960.\" Peggy gasps. She begins to tremble.  \n[31]\t\tHow do you feel?  \n[32]\t\tCome on. Get in. I can take care of \t\tthat.  \tPeggy warily gets in. Charlie leans over to kiss her, but she \tpushes him away. No dice.  \n[33]\t\tHey, I can take a hint. You look \t\tgreat today.  \tCharlie starts the car, burns rubber and peels out.  \n[34]\t\tI call this the staccato. \t\t\t  \n[35] \n[36]\t\t\t \t\tNot that I'm glad you were sick, \t\tbut I had a chance to do some \t\tthinking last night.  \n[37]\t\tYou know. About what we said on \t\tTuesday. It makes a lot of sense.  \n[38]\t\tHow could you forget? We talk about \t\tseeing other people and you forget?  \n[39]\t\tI can understand that.. But please \t\tdon't start crying again.  \n[40]\t\tIt's not going to be forever. I \t\tfigure three years is long enough. \t\tI can see it the music pans out. \t\t\t \t\tAnd right after graduation we \t\tshould start seeing other people. \t\tKind of comparison shop before we \t\tsettle down and get married. Know \t\twhat I mean?  \n[41]\t\t\t \t\tWell, we got the prom coming up, \t\tall these parties. We shouldn't \t\tupset our parents?  \n[42]\t\tYou're more shook up than you want \t\tto admit. You'll get used to it, \t\twe'll still see each other 2, 3 \t\ttimes a week.  \tCharlie opens the locker. Peggy watches carefully, memorizing \ttho combination. He takes out a few books as Peggy notices \ther schedule on the locker door.  \n[43]\t\tWant me to drive you home later?  \n[44]\t\t\t \t\tWould I?!! Why I oughta...  \tUnaccountably, this cracks Charlie up. He walks away \tlaughing. Peggy looks completely puzzled. She is surrounded \tby a sea of people, who say hello. She can't remember their \tnames.  \n[45]\t\tI've got to string him along for a \t\twhile. It's for his own good.  \n[46]\t\tSoon. I can't tall everybody \t\teverything all at once.  \tPeggy, Carol and Maddy walk over and sit down with trays. \tPeggy deliberately avoids the empty sear next to Charlie. \tThey're uneasy with each other. Peggy looks with disgust at \tthe slop on the tray.  \n[47]\t\tI'll throw the book at you!  \n[48]\t\tHe's a nice guy. You know he's \t\twriting a book?  \n[49]\t\tLooking good out there.  \n[50]\t\tI noticed you were giving me the \t\tsilent treatment at lunch. I guess \t\tI deserved it. I've been thinking \t\tabout my three year plan and I \t\tthink it's unworkable. I must have \t\tbeen delirious.  \n[51]\t\tIn the abstract maybe. Get a grip \t\ton yourself! But when I imagine you \t\tgoing out with other guys, I \t\tfeel... ah...  \n[52]\t\tYeah. Like that.  \n[53]\t\tHello, sir. How are things at the \t\that store?  \n[54]\t\tYes, sir.  \n[55]\t\tYes, sir. But that's what I like \t\tabout her. She's not like all the \t\tother girls at school.  \n[56]\t\tYes, sir. Trust is a two\u0097way \t\tstreet. In the past two years I've \t\tbeen pleased to note that you and \t\tMrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled \t\tyour sacred trust of being good \t\tparents to the, uh, woman I plan to \t\ttake off your hands.  \tMr. Kelcher looks as if he's witnessing the latest attack of \tteenage weirdness.  \n[57]\t\tWhat would that be, sir?  \n[58]\t\t\t \t\tOf course.  \n[59]\t\tGreat, isn't it?  \n[60]\t\tHey! What's the fun of being a \t\tteenager if you can't dress weird? \t\tAnd we're going to have fun \t\ttonight, right?  \n[61] \n[62]\t\tIs this slow enough for you?  \n[63]\t\tI'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are \t\tyou? Are we talking on the phone? \t\tAre we pen pals?  \n[64]\t\tIt's great. I cleaned the car, do \t\tyou like it? Oh, I got tickets for \t\tFabian on your birthday, you like \t\thim, right? He's cool. Eighteen is \t\thalf of thirty six. It's \"Gentlemen \t\tstart your engines\", vroom, like \t\tI'm gassed up ready for the race. \t\tI've got the girl, I've got the \t\tcar, I've got the talent, but I \t\tdon't know. Do I date, get married, \t\tjoin the army, cut a record, go to \t\tcollege? I got a million choices, \t\tbut nobody teaches you how to \t\tchoose. But it's different for a \t\tgirl. You're Lucky. You just have \t\tto wait for me.  \n[65]\t\tHere comes the life of the party.  \n[66]\t\tHave no fear. Charlie's here.  \n[67]\t\tWhy Pete's the best darn cook on \t\tthe Panhandle!  \n[68]\t\tReady. Set. Go -  \tArthur rapidly chug\u0097a\u0097lugs the entire beer and immediately \trecites from memory as the boys urge him on:  \n[69]\t\tToo bad. Close to a record.  \n[70]\t\tPitching wins pennants. The Tigers \t\tgot four potential twenty game \t\twinners.  \n[71]\t\tDon Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning \t\tand Paul Foytack.  \n[72]\t\tOne, two, three-...  \tThe group begins to SING an A CAPELLA version of RAMA LAMA \tDING DONG . Charlie sings lead, backed up by \tthe other three. Walter dances insane, Temptation\u0097like steps. \tThe crowd huddles around them, clapping and grooving. Peggy \tis on the planet of lost innocence, removed and melancholy.  \n[73]\t\tIs he gonna help you with that \t\tphysics stuff?  \n[74]\t\tHey! Who needs physics when \t\twe've got chemistry?  \n[75]\t\tThere isn't a girl in school that \t\tcan hold a candle to you..  \n[76]\t\tYeah I know.  But I don't have to \t\tflatter you.  It just feels right. \t\tYou're the perfect girl for me.  As \t\tin is, was and always will be.  I'm \t\tglad dancing was invented.  You \t\tknow the first dances were rituals. \t\tLike fertility rites.  \tAs they dance Charlie gets embarrassed by an erection, and \tmoves his hips away from Peggy.  She surprises him by \tgrabbing his tush and pulling him into her.  \n[77] \tThe windows are fogged.  Peggy and Charlie kiss tenderly.  \n[78]\t\tYour eyes look like silver pools of \t\tmoonlight.  And the tide rushes in.  \n[79]\t\tYou know I do.  I even wrote you \t\tinto my will.  \n[80]\t\tWhat?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? \t\t\t \t\tYou want to have intercourse! Last \t\tweekend you said... What time is \t\tit?  \n[81]\t\tBut you're the one who wanted to \t\twait till we got married. And you \t\twere right. We should wait.  \n[82]\t\tWho?  \tPeggy starts to GIGGLE, realizing the absurdity of the \tsituation. The more she GIGGLES, the more agitated Charlie \tgets. Peggy starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt.  \n[83]\t\tYou mean my wang? Listen, it's \t\trunning real late.  \tCharlie pushes her away, angry..  \n[84]\t\tWhat is this? What the hell is \t\tgoing on? One week you say, \"If you \t\tlove me you won't\", now you say \"If \t\tyou love me you will\". \t\t\t \t\tExcuse me. That's a guy's line!  \tPeggy realizes she's blown it. Charlie isn't ready for this.  \n[85]\t\tYou're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! \t\tYou sure know how to spoil a mood.  \tCharlie straightens himself up, starts the car and burns out.  \n[86]\t\tSave it.  \tPeggy watches him go. Looking at her darkened house, she \tturns and walks down the street.  \n[87]\t\tTake the Shostakovich home and \t\tlisten to it. Let it grow on you. \t\tEveryone that's bought it has come \t\tback and said, \"This is definitive \t\tShostakovich. Thank you for \t\tencouraging me to investigate it.\"  \n[88]\t\tYou'll like it. I kid you not.  \n[89]\t\tNothing.. Selling is selling.  \n[90]\t\tForget it. I've been thinking. \t\tGirls must go through that stuff \t\ttoo. Sometimes when I look at you I \t\tfeel like an animal. Maybe my dad's \t\tright. Teenagers are nuts.  \n[91]\t\tYeah, I know. Girls mature faster \t\tthan guys. But last night, I was \t\tthe one who put on the brakes. And \t\tyou know why?  \n[92]\t\tBecause nothing else matters. \t\tThat's the great thing about love. \t\tEvery time we argue, every time \t\tsomething goes wrong, and I know \t\tthat I'm not perfect either, things \t\tjust work out better in the end. \t\tCause you're my baby and I love \t\tyou.  \n[93]\t\tDon't be cruel to a heart that's \t\ttrue.  \n[94]\t\t\t \t\tI have to talk to you..  \tThrough her sleep\u0097clouded eyes, Peggy begins to focus on the \tface of the younger Charlie. Suddenly, she remembers.  \n[95]\t\t\t \t\tLet's go down to the basement.  \n[96]\t\tI want to know what's going on. \t\tDolores told me that you and that \t\tscuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...  \n[97]\t\t\t \t\tThen it's true, dammit! I had a \t\tmiserable time tonight 'cause of \t\tyou. When the Monotones did \"Book \t\tof Love \u0097\u0097 Chapter Four you break \t\tup, won't you give it just one more \t\tchance...\" I'm thinking Did we \t\tbreak up? 'Cause if we did, I don't \t\teven know about it!. I thought we \t\tcleared all that up yesterday. Did \t\tthat Maynard G. Beatnik give you \t\twhat you wanted?  \n[98]\t\tYou're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. \t\tNobody treats Charlie Bodell like \t\tthis.  \n[99]\t\tLook, I've got the hair, got the \t\teyes, got the teeth, I got the car. \t\tI'm the lead singer, I'm the man.  \n[100]\t\tI will be happy if I have you. I \t\tlove you.  \n[101]\t\tWhat are you talking about? Who's \t\tJanet?  \n[102]\t\tWhat about everything I said to you \t\tthis afternoon...  \n[103]\t\tBut what has to be different?  \n[104]\t\tWhat! What about the group and my \t\tsinging career? What about me?  \n[105]\t\tYou don't know zip! You think I'm \t\tgoing to end up selling appliances \t\tlike my father? Chasing women \t\taround the store. I've got to give \t\tit a shot. Why are you trying to \t\tkill the two things that mean the \t\tmost to me? Until yesterday you \t\tloved me and you loved us. \t\t\t ) \t\tWhat the hell has changed? For two \t\tyears I've done nothing but love \t\tyou. I'll show you, I'm going to be \t\tjust like Fabian!  \tCharlie exits. Peggy slumps back, drained. Getting up, she \tcrosses to the mounted swordfish. Standing on a chair she \treaches into the mouth of the fish and pulls out a package of \tPall Malls. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and picks up a \ttable lighter and flicks it. As it lights, the tiny music box \tinside PLAYS SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES.  \n[106] \n[107]\tMICHAEL. Michael observes Peggy's intimate reaction to \tCharlie's singing.  \n[108] \tPeggy walks down a residential street, much like her \tparents'. She stops when she sees Charlie's car parked in a \tdriveway, and leans against a tree next to his car. Moments \tlater, Charlie exits his house, a dog trailing behind him. \tThe dog runs up to Peggy. Charlie is wary and distant.  \n[109]\t\tWhat're you doing here?  \n[110]\t\tRusty's dead. That's Ajax  \tCharlie throws a stick. Ajax chases it, never comes back.  \n[111]\t\tSorry, the Blue Thunder's out of \t\tcommission for a while.  \n[112]\t\tHow'd you know about that?  \n[113]\t\tNot terrific enough. What were you \t\tdoing in that part of town? Who \t\twere you with?  \n[114]\t\tHey. I guess there's a lot of \t\tthings we don't know about each \t\tother.  \tCharlie and Peggy walking.  \n[115]\t\tThat's real big of you.  \n[116]\t\tYou're kidding. You wrote a song? \t\tIs it about a guilty girl and a \t\ttrusting guy... she wants to hurt \t\thim, and he wonders why?  \tPeggy takes a piece of paper from her purse.  \n[117]\t\tFat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins \t\tcame to hear me last night. He told \t\tme to forget it. You told me to \t\tforget it. My parents tell me to \t\tforget it.  \n[118]\t\tIf you took the trouble to write \t\tit, then sure, I'll take a look at \t\tit. But I'm beginning to think that \t\tmaybe there's more to life than \t\tmusic. I wonder if people would \t\tstill like me if I stopped being \t\tMr. Excitement?  \n[119]\t\tDoes this mean you like me again?  \n[120]\t\tThat's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause \t\tI'm never going to give up on us. \t\tIt's easy to fall apart in a \t\tcrisis. It's easy to be selfish and \t\tsay goodbye and good luck. But this \t\tis more than love. This is a mental \t\tdecision. Just wait till tomorrow, \t\twhen you see your birthday present. \t\tThen you'll understand.  \tCharlie walks away as Peggy reaches into the locker for her \tbooks.  \n[121]\t\tWalter, maybe you should be a \t\tdentist.  \n[122]\t\tHey, Peggy. Wait a minute.  \tPeggy stops on the landing. Charlie joins her, so eager. He \tdoesn't notice how distraught she is.  \n[123]\t\tI cut shop and did some work on \t\tyour song. You know, it's not half \t\tbad for your first try. Of course, \t\tI changed all the \"yeahs\" to \t\t\"oohs\". Listen to this.  \tCharlie begins to sing an R&amp;B version of SHE LOVES YOU.  \n[124]\t\tOkay. Listen, I cancelled the \t\ttickets for Fabian. I thought it \t\twould be better for your birthday \t\tto eat at a nice restaurant, Chez \t\tTres.  \tWalter, Arthur, Maddy and Carol watch as Peggy runs away.  \n[125]\t\tI was trying to save you. They were \t\tgoing to vaporize you.  \n[126]\t\tYou're going to listen to me.  \tCharlie tries to Lead Peggy into the car.  \n[127]\t\tRight here. Now sit down.  \tCharlie sits her down on the ground. She's impatient and \thopping mad.  \n[128]\t\tLook. I wanna tell you. I forgive \t\tyou for everything. I know what \t\tyou've been going through. You're \t\tjust scared. I was scared, too, but \t\tI'm not anymore.  \n[129]\t\tBecause I love you, damnit! I had a \t\tlong talk with your father \t\tyesterday and we decided that the \t\tbest thing for us to do is get \t\tmarried and settle down. Right \t\taway.  \tPeggy jumps up, exploding to Charlie.  \n[130]\t\tWhat?  \n[131]\t\tYou're crazy! You're really out of \t\tyour mind!  \n[132]\t\tOh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all \t\tmy fault. I'm so sorry. I won't \t\tbother you anymore. I promise. \t\tPlease stop crying. Please.  \tPeggy starts to compose herself.  \n[133]\t\tOf course.  \tCharlie helps her up. Be reaches into his pocket and takes \tout a small box, handing it to Peggy.  \n[134]\t\tIt's almost your birthday. I wasn't \t\tsure when you were coming back, so \t\tI brought your present up here.  \tWith a slow, growing remembrance, Peggy opens the box. Inside \tis the gold locket Peggy was wearing at the reunion.  \n[135]\t\tIt opens, too. Look inside.  \tPeggy opens the locket. She shivers with recognition.  \n[136]\t\t\t \t\tI love you.  \n[137]\t\tI think we should get out of here. \t\tIt's going to rain.  \n[138]\t\tWhat the hell is that?  \tFlying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon \tkite. The center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing \tlike a marquee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY PEGGY SUE.  \tThe kite begins to descend towards them. Peggy jumps to her \tfeet and races towards it. She grabs the tail and starts to \tsail away with the kite. Charlie chases after her.  \n[139]\t\tPeggy! Where're you going? Come \t\tback!  \n[140]\t\tBut I love you. I'll love you \t\tforever.  \n[141]\t\tCome back to me.  \n[142]\t\tRichard, do something!  \n[143]\t\tPeggy!  \tCharlie, Richard and the old men behold Peggy, bobbing and \tdipping playfully in the sky. We begin to HEAR Charlie's \tVOICE singing \"Peggy Sue\" O.S. Peggy looks down with wonder \tat the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the \tblackness. In an instant she becomes a star.  \n[144]\t\t. \t\tPeggy Sue, I love you, and I need \t\tyou Peggy Sue...  \n[145]\t\tI thought you were...for a while.  \n[146]\t\tBut happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.  \n[147]\t\tI wanted to apologize. I can't live \t\twithout you.  \n[148]\t\tThat's over. I got tired of \t\ttranslating everything. She thought \t\tthe Big Hopper was a hamburger.  \tCharlie laughs uncomfortably and Peggy Sue looks around her \thospital room.  \n[149]\t\tEveryone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol \t\tand Walter. Richard Norvick.  And \t\there's a book, by that guy from \t\thigh school, Michael Fitzsimmons. \t\tHe dedicated it to you.  \tCharlie returns to Peggy's bedside and opens the front cover \tof the book.  \tANGLE ON BOOK: the front page bears the title \"The Pilgrim \tSoul\" and the dedication reads \"to Peggy Sue and a Starry \tNight\".  \tPeggy smiles but shakes her head.  \n[150]\t\tI'll just set it right here.  \tHe places the book on her bedside table as he sits back down.  \n[151]\t\tOh, God, Dion.  \n[152]\t\tI'll never give up.  \n[153]\t\tI loved you since the day I met \t\tyou, and I haven't stopped.  \n[154]\t\tListen, I don't expect all the \t\ttroubles between us can just vanish \t\taway. But I would do what I can...  \n[155]\t\tWell, I'll let you get some \t\trest...so long.  \tThe VIEW PULLS BACK past the flowers. Charlie starts to exit. \tChecks himself in the mirror.  ", "Bodell": "\n[1] \tMOVING VIEW, revealing the empty house. We HEAR the RECORDING \n[2] \t\"Crazy Charlie's Discount Appliances\" truck has parked in \tfront of the house. WORKMEN are loading boxes of records, \ttapes, etc. Charlie pulls up, waves to workmen.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tLook at that freezer chest. What \t\tcapacity. \t\t\t \t\tHello Peggy Sue.  \n[4]\t\tFine, just fine.  \tPeggy gives him a big hug and a kiss on the cheek.  \n[5]\t\tCharlie's in the back.  \tPeggy walks towards the back as Mr. Bodell explains:  \n[6]\t\tMy future daughter\u0097in\u0097law. Very \t\taffectionate girl.  ", "Rosalie": "\n[1]\t\tI remember that dress.  \n[2]\t\tI remember when you got that \t\tlocket, too. You were so excited \t\tI think you showed it to the whole \t\tschool.  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tI think you got married when you \t\twere three.  \n[4]\t\tI enjoyed it.  \n[5]\t\tWhat's up?  \n[6]\t\tDon't be silly, I'm the best in \t\tthe county.  \n[7]\t\tI spend three hours a day \t\tpracticing. I have trainers, I know \t\twhat I'm doing.  \n[8]\t\tNot to me they don't. I'm going to \t\twin the State, then the. Nationals, \t\tand then I'm going to the Olympics.  \n[9]\t\tYou're sick. You should go to the \t\tnurse. I'm going to tell Miss \t\tDennis.  \tRosalie exits into the pool area. Peggy feels helpless.  ", "Testa": "", "Walter": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tJust call me Walter the dancing \t\tdentist. Taps and caps. My \t\tspecialty.  \n[2]\t\t\t \t\tWhoa! Cat fight! Purse war!  \n[3]\t\tThe best thing about being a \t\tdentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade. \t\tA couple of lines of this, I can \t\tdrill my own teeth... \t\t\t(looks at her for a \t\tmoment \t\tHi.  \n[4] \n[5]\t\t\t \t\tI demand a recount. \t\t\t  \n[6]\t\tWhy does your father take inventory \t\ton Sunday night? That's poker \t\tnight. You always got out of it \t\tbefore.  \n[7]\t\tStrange rumors are sweeping the \t\tschool about you.  \n[8]\t\tProm what I hear, you really gave \t\tit to old Smellgrove.  \n[9]\t\tThat's enough out of you, little \t\tlady.  \n[10]\t\tShe's not wasting any time. Peggy \t\tSue and Mr. Square Root?  \n[11]\t\tOh, a book... Excuse me for a \t\tsecond. \t\t\t  \n[12]\t\tOh, it's you is it.  \n[13]\t\tThe Yanks got the hitting but the \t\tSox got the defense.  \n[14]\t\t\t \t\tLike who?  \n[15]\t\tPut on some make\u0097out music, and \t\tkill the lights.  \tWe HEAR a RECORD SCRATCH. A slow song begins. The lights are \tdimmed. Coupler begin to slow dance. Charlie holds Peggy \tclose, barely moving. Peggy is misty\u0097eyed, moved by being in \tCharlie's arms again.  \n[16]\t\tHey Charlie, what do you think of \t\tthis?  \tWalter does a totally demented dance step, finishing by \tstrumming his leg like a guitar. He stands there grinning.  ", "Getz": "", "Jack": "", "Delores": "", "Dodge": ""}}
