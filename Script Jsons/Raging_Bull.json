We got a grand \t     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking \t     grand! \t \tJAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild \talley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another. \t \tThe SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill. \t \tREEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas. \t \tThe REFEREE counts: \t \n[3]\t \t     Don't get out of the ring. You won \t     the fight -- let him go out first. \t \n[4]\t     Salvy, would I steer you wrong? \t     Let's say that's the truck; it's \t     full of cigarettes, right? Now, two \t     o'clock this morning we move the \t     truck from here to there, \t          (he points; the CAMERA \n[5]\t     What do you want from my life, \t     Salvy? He's my brother. \t \n[6]\t \t     Hey, leave the kids alone. \t \n[7]\t \t     Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your \t     trouble. There's some bums around \t     the corner -- they need your help. \t \n[8]\t \t     Here's my new suit. \t \t     Right here. \t \n[9]\t     Just kidding, take it easy. \t \t     No fuckin' sense of humor. \t \tSALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling. \t \n[10]\t     I can't convince him. He's got such \t     a thick head, I'd like to crack it \t     open myself. Believe me, my own \t     brother. It's very hard. You don't \t     have to convince me -- I know we \t     should be with Tommy. You talk to \t     him. He don't listen to nobody. \t \n[11]\t     All right, I'll try. See you later. \t \n[12]\t     Right, the gym. \t \tSALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building. \t \n[13]\t \t     What's the matter? \t \n[14]\t \t     What's the matter? You're drinking. \t     You're eating like an animal. \t \tJOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink \tin his hand, and tears on his face. \t \n[15]\t     What's wrong? \t \n[16]\t     Hey, c'mon, what's the matter? \t \n[17]\t     What're you talking about? He's a \t     heavyweight. You're a middleweight. \t \tJAKE holds out his scarred hands. \t \n[18]\t     That's what I'm sayin'. You \t     shouldn't even think like that. \t     It's crazy. \t \n[19]\t     You know? \t \n[20]\t     Sure. What is it? \t \n[21]\t \t     You want me to do what? \t \n[22]\t     C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks. \t \n[23]\t     Jack, I got no gloves. \t \n[24]\t     Jack! Enough! \t \n[25]\t     What was that for? I know you can \t     take punches. I can hit you from \t     now to doomsday. What the fuck does \t     that prove? \t \n[26]\t     Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to \t     talk to you. So I... \t \n[27]\t     What are you getting so hot about -- \t     Tommy Como told him to come down \t     here... \t \n[28]\t     I didn't tell them to come. Tommy \t     Como... \t \tThe bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body \tpunches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of \tpunches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs. \t \n[29]\t     You cocksucker. \t \tJAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY \twatches unseen from the doorway. \t \n[30]\t     Whadda you care? \t \n[31]\t     No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna \t     meet her? \t \n[32]\t     Cause I'll go right over there and \t     bring her here. \t \n[33]\t     You sure you wanna meet her? Don't \t     make me go over there, you change \t     your mind and you make me look bad, \t     cause she's really a knockout. \t     She's 15, this kid -- a great piece \t     of ass. \t \n[34]\t     No, I see her around the pool. I \t     know her. I know her like that -- \t     not like that. \t \n[35]\t \t     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I \t     know she'll be there. \t \n[36]\t     How you gonna catch anybody alone \t     at a dance?... I don't know if \t     she'll be there alone... She'll \t     probably be there with her \t     girlfriends or something. \t \n[37]\t     Nah, she don't go with nobody. \t     She's only 15 years old. \t \n[38]\t     Probably. You know she talks to \t     everybody, and not just him. \t \n[39]\t     Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' \t     you. \t \n[40]\t     Huh? \t \n[41]\t     With her? How? \t \n[42]\t     Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I \t     know her from around here, that's \t     all. You want to meet her or what? \t \n[43]\t \t     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I \t     know she'll be there. Dressed up \t     and everything. \t \n[44]\t     C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna \t     get outa here tonight. \t \tJOEY sips a drink as JAKE knots his tie. IRMA enters from the \tbedroom. \t \n[45]\t     What a mouth on her -- you shoulda \t     hit her -- no good fuckin' Jewish \t     cunt -- breakin' our balls. You \t     shoulda hit her with a chair. \t \n[46]\t     No, but Jake... how much abuse can \t     you take. \t \n[47]\t     Look, could you move a little. \t     Would you mind, darling? \t \n[48]\t \t     All right, darling, I'll just stand \t     here and wait. \t \tJOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals, \tcovers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past \ther. JOEY smiles. \t \tJOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table. \t \n[49]\t     Give me a chance. Let me look. \t \n[50]\t     THERE she is over there on the \t     other side. What did I tell you? \t     Oh, ain't she nice? Ain't she a \t     fuckin' doll? \t \tAs they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV: \t \tSALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They \tare in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are \tobviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood \tdance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with \tthem. They get up to leave. \t \n[51]\t \t     Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be \t     afraid. C'mere. Just say hello. \t     This is my brother. \t \tVICKIE comes over to the fence. \t \n[52]\t     Vickie, I want you to meet my \t     brother, Jake. He's gonna be the \t     next champ. \t \tJAKE puts his fingers through the fence. \t \n[53]\t     The fuckin' papers are full of \t     Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and \t     Jake knocked him clear outa the \t     ring in Detroit. He's the only guy \t     ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa \t     matter with you? I thought we had \t     an arrangement. \t \n[54]\t     You holding me up for more cash or \t     what? \t \tThe bell sounds, ending the sparring round. \t \n[55]\t     C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look \t     stupid. I brought these guys up \t     here, now you don't wanna talk to \t     them? What are ya doin'? Open your \t     mouth, for Christsake. \t \tJAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly \tover to the REPORTER, who is about to say: \"Hi, Jake.\" \t \n[56]\t \t     Don't worry. Don't worry. It's \t     gonna be all right. \t \t     Ask him your questions. \t \n[57]\t \t     He fights the toughest guys around \t     that everybody else is afraid to \t     fight... \t \n[58]\t \t     They robbed us! Those fuckin' \t     judges -- What the fuck fight were \t     they watching? If I see them on the \t     street, I'll break their heads. \t     Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! \t     Those judges give him the decision \t     'cause he's goin in the army next \t     week! How else could this have \t     happened?... What do you think they \t     gave him the decision for, that's \t     why. \t \n[59]\t     You won and was robbed! You didn't \t     do nothin' wrong. \t \n[60]\t     You want us to wait for you? \t \n[61]\t     Jake, you're the one who said you \t     could get down to 155! What did I \t     do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat? \t \n[62]\t     You want the title shot? \t \n[63]\t     You want the title shot or not? \t \n[64]\t \t     This Janiro's an up-and-coming \t     fighter, this kid you gotta knock \t     out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm \t     telling you, this is your step \t     towards getting a shot at the \t     title. Listen to me: I'm telling \t     you. You been killin' yourself for \t     three years. There's nobody left -- \t     they're afraid to fight you. \t     This Janiro's up-and-coming. He \t     don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, \t     wipe him out! What are you worried \t     about? Your weight? Look, even if \t     you lose they're gonna think you're \t     weak; they're gonna think you're \t     not the fighter you used to be. \t     They'll match you with guys they \t     were afraid to match you with \t     before, and then you'll kill them \t     and you'll get your title shot. And \t     if you beat this kid Janiro, they \t     gotta give you a shot at the title \t     because there's nobody else. Either \t     way you win and you do it on your \t     own -- just like you want it. All \t     right? \t \n[65]\t     Nah, she would never... \t \n[66]\t \t      C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy \t      about you. \t \tJAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy. \t \n[67]\t \t      Excuse me for a minute. Be right \t      back. \t \n[68]\t      Jake, come over for a few minutes. \t      Tommy wants to say hello to you. \t      C'mon, just come and say hello. \t \tJAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway. \t \tANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over. \t \n[69]\t      I love you. \t \tJAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight, \tstill manages to prance around the ring victoriously. \t \tVICKIE, now near the ring, throws kisses to JAKE. \t \n[70]\t \t      I dunno. We're working on it. He's \t      training at the camp now. \t \n[71]\t      We're gonna get our shot. \t \tThe DETROIT PROMOTER introduces JOEY to JACKIE CURTIE. \t \n[72]\t      Betcha more than he has. \t \n[73]\t      Ain't he dead? \t \n[74]\t      Yeah? \t \n[75]\t \t      Just a minute. Excuse me. I'll be \t      right back. \t \tThe table area: JOEY arrives at SALVY's table. VICKIE is \tnervous. There is a cold exchange of'\"hellos.\" \t \n[76]\t \t      C'mere, let me talk to you for a \t      minute. \t \tThere is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and \ttakes her over to the hat-check area. \t \n[77]\t      What're you doin' with Salvy? You \t      shouldn't be here with him. Jake's \t      away killin' himself. Suppose he \t      found out. \t \n[78]\t      No, you're his wife. \t \n[79]\t      It don't look right. \t \n[80]\t      I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but \t      if he finds out, he will kill you. \t      What's the matter with you? Aren't \t      you happy? You got everything you \t      want. \t \n[81]\t      Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's \t      got a lotta aggravation. He's been \t      a top contender too long. \t \n[82]\t      And you're drinking with them right \t      now. \t \n[83]\t \t      You're wrong to be here. Let's go. \t \tVICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table. \t \tThe table area: JOEY arrives at the table. He grabs VICKIE. \t \n[84]\t      I said, let's go. \t \n[85]\t      Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister \t      in-law. \t \n[86]\t      What do you think, I'm blind? My \t      brother's breaking his ass in a \t      ring, and you're here with his \t      wife. \t \n[87]\t      Get the fuck outa here. What did \t      you do, take your gangster pills \t      today? I'll tear your fuckin' head \t      off your shoulders! \t \tJOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react. \t \tThe GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her \tleave, and calls after her. \t \n[88]\t      Hey, wait -- \t \tPAUL comes over and stops the fight. \t \n[89]\t           (as he turns and lashes \t           into Salvy and Patsy \t      I'll suck your eyes out! I'll \t      fuckin' take the two of you. \t \tAfter a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come \tout. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY \tand JOEY, but can't. \t \tJOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street \tagainst the parked cars. \t \n[90]\t      Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc. \t      ... \t \tSALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him. \tSALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him. \t \tPAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY \ttries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him. \t \n[91]\t      Yeah, I understand, Tommy. \t \n[92]\t      Yeah, they're good. They're good, \t      Tommy. \t \n[93]\t      Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that. \t \n[94]\t      How can he embarrass you? \t \n[95]\t      Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't \t      even say hello to anybody else -- \t      you know that. But you know when \t      Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus \t      Christ Almighty could get off the \t      fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna \t      talk him out of it. I'm his kid \t      brother. I got no say with Jake on \t      this. He thinks he can buck \t      everybody and make it on his own. \t \n[96]\t      Whatcha doin'? \t \n[97]\t      Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit \t      her so she can't talk to you the \t      way she wants to. \t \n[98]\t      Try talkin' to her. She's your wife \t      -- ask her what's the matter. \t \n[99]\t      Jack, if there was anything funny, \t      I would tell you. \t \n[100]\t      Sure, I'll keep an eye on her. \t \n[101]\t      I got good news, and I got bad \t      news. The good news is you got your \t      shot at the title. The bad news \t      is... \t \n[102]\t      Sure. \t \n[103]\t \t      It woulda been so easy, Jack. So \t      easy... \t \tJOEY goes into a boxing stance. \t \n[104]\t      Stick out your hands, Jake. \t \n[105]\t      G'wan, do it. \t \t      Protect yourself, rummy. \t \tJAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY \tfeigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- \"out cold.\" JAKE \tlooks down at him. \t \tJOEY pops to his feet. \t \n[106]\t      See? That's all there was to it. \t \n[107]\t      Except fall down like a normal \t      person. \t \n[108]\t      All right, you don't wanna fall \t      down, so now you gotta take a rest. \t      So, you enjoy the suspension. \t      'Cause there's nothin' you can do \t      about it. Let the Commissioner and \t      the D.A. jerk you around. So you \t      wait. \t \n[109]\t      We did what we had to do. Tommy \t      don't forget. Sooner or later \t      you'll get your shot -- if Tommy \t      don't die. \t \n[110]\t      That's right. \"No comment.\" \t \t      You like that? Good, 'cause I got a \t      lot more \"No comments\" where that \t      one came from. \t \tJOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the \thook. \t \n[111]\t      I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have \t      a steak. \t \n[112]\t      So eat just a little. You gotta eat \t      something. \t \n[113]\t      How long did it take you? \t \n[114]\t      No good. Try to get it down. It's \t      gotta be no more than 30 seconds to \t      be on the safe side if we gotta \t      stitch him up. \t \n[115]\t      Jake, somebody wants to say hello \t      to you. \t \tJOEY opens the door wider. TOMMY COMO is at the door with \tJOEY. JAKE goes over to the door. \t \n[116]\t      Jake, Jake... \t \tTONY and the DOCTOR watch from the doorway. \t \tVICKIE's eyes close. JAKE releases his grip. JOEY helps \tVICKIE. JAKE watches this. \t \n[117]\t      Look at him, Jackie! You got at! \t      The fuckin' championship! He's \t      yours! Finish him off. \t \tJAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in \tCERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the \tfight. \t \tThe REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the \tmike: \t \n[118]\t      Hi, Vickie. \t \tJAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE. VICKIE notices JAKE'S \treaction. \t \n[119]\t      Screw you, Jack. \t \n[120]\t      What? I just said hello. Since when \t      I can't kiss my sister-in-law? \t \n[121]\t      Well, you're not supposed to kiss \t      your mother on the mouth. \t \n[122]\t      I can't tell. You're stomach's in \t      the way. \t \tJAKE stares at JOEY. \t \n[123]\t      Don't give me those looks. I'm just \t      your manager. The minute you start \t      to be champ, you start eating like \t      there's no tomorrow. And you giving \t      me looks. All I know is that I \t      don't have to defend my title next \t      month. \t \tJAKE looks up at JOEY. \t \n[124]\t      When? \t \n[125]\t           (being as vague as \t           possible \t      Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He \t      was drunk or somethin', I dunno. \t      Anyway, the windup was I gave him a \t      beatin'. Tommy called me down, and \t      we straightened it out. It's all \t      forgotten about. \t \n[126]\t      It didn't have nothin' to do with \t      you. \t \n[127]\t      No, I just told you what happened. \t \n[128]\t      Jack, no. I just explained the \t      whole thing to you. It was just \t      between me and Salvy, if it had \t      anything to do with you and Vickie, \t      I woulda told you about it. \t \n[129]\t      \"You heard some things.\" Will you \t      stop worryin' about that shit? \t      Forget about it. You know you got a \t      title fight comin' up. \t \n[130]\t \t      Whatever you touched, that's good \t      now. \t \n[131]\t      What? \t \n[132]\t \t      I did keep an eye... \t \n[133]\t      Some things changed between us. \t      Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. \t      He's been passing certain remarks \t      that I don't like. \t \n[134]\t      What bullshit? Hey, I'm your \t      brother. You wanna believe me - you \t      trust me? \t \n[135]\t      Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm \t      tellin\" you what happened. He got \t      outta line, we had a fight, and \t      it's staightened out now. \t \tThere is a pause. \t \n[136]\t \t      So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill \t      Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy \t      Como, kill me while you're at it. \t      What do I care? You're killing \t      yourself the way you're eating, the \t      way you worry about things you \t      don't have to worry about. \t \n[137]\t      What? \t \n[138]\t \t      I meant, kill everybody. You or me \t      or anybody. You're a big shot. \t      Kill, kill... g'head. \t \n[139]\t      So what? \t \n[140]\t      You're worried about this girl, \t      you're gonna let this girl ruin \t      you're life for you... You wanna \t      worry, worry about your fuckin' \t      stomach that you can't bend over -- \t      that you gotta step in the ring in \t      a month. \t \n[141]\t      What? \t \n[142]\t      Whadda ya mean? \t \n[143]\t      Whatsa matter with you? \t \n[144]\t           (fed up, he starts to \t           leave \t      I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. \t      I can't take this shit. Lenore is \t      waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're \t      a definite wacko. You're fuckin' \t      crazy, you know that, crazy. \t \tJAKE'S P.O.V., MOVING SHOT as JOEY leaves. JAKE goes into the \tbedroom. \t \n[145]\t \tJOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family. \tHis wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to \thim. JOEY's TWO KIDS sit across the table from them, \tbickering. \t \n[146]\t \t      Don't hit your brother! Be nice. \t \tSuddenly, JAKE comes through the front door, goes directly to \tthe table, grabs JOEY, lifts him into the air, and starts \thitting him. \t \n[147]\t      Jake, stop it. \t \tJAKE keeps hitting JOEY. The KIDS start to cry. LENORE wants \tto stop the fight, but is afraid to get too close. \t \n[148]\t      Stop it. What're you, crazy? \t \tJAKE drags JOEY into the living room, and pushes him onto the \tfloor. \t \n[149]\t \tVICKIE gives JAKE a final push out the door and then slams it \tin his face. \t \tJAKE is left alone on the front steps. \t \n[150]\t      Hello... hello... \t \tJAKE can't answer. \t \n[151]\t      What's this, a joke? Hello... Hey! \t \tJAKE can't answer. \t \n[152]\t      Well, if there's somebody \t      listenin', their mother's a fuckin' \t      whore who takes it in the ass. \t \tThere is a click as JOEY hangs up. \t \tJAKE stands there, and finally hangs up the phone. \t \n[153]\t14, 1951 \t \tLENORE, JOEY's wife, watches the 6th Robinson-LaMotta fight \ton JOEY's new television console. \t \tJOEY walks by on his way to another room, but stops to watch. \t \tLENORE is not a fight fan, but is caught up in the fight, \tanyway. \t \n[154]\t      I can't believe he's getting that \t      jab in. \t \tThe bell sounds, and a Pabst commercial comes on: \t \n[155]\t \tROBINSON makes his move. His arms are a blur, swinging \trapidly but accurately. \t \tJOEY and LENORE are suddenly silent. \t ", "Guido": "", "Irma": "\n[1]\t \tJAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits \tat the kitchen table  while \this wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove. \t \tJAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork. \t \n[2]\t     It's not done. \t \n[3]\t     Here's your steak. You can't wait \t     for it to be done. Here. \t \tShe slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the \tstove. \t \n[4]\t     Here's your carrots. You're in such \t     a hurry. You can't wait. \t \n[5]\t \tSALVY and JOEY approach the building. \t \n[6]\t \tJOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it. \t \n[7]\t     He's doing it again. \t \n[8]\t \n[9]\t \n[10]\t     Where you going at this hour? \t \n[11]\t     You fuckin' worm, if you're going \t     out, I'm going out. \t \n[12]\t     None of your fuckin' business. \t \tJOEY lifts his eyes up. \t \n[13]\t     That's right -- run out. I ain't \t     gonna be here when you get back. \t \n[14]\t \tJAKE and JOEY hurry down the stairs. IRMA shouts after them. \t \n[15]\t     Bunch of guys. You all hang out \t     together. Yeah, you're all going \t     out on business. You're all gonna \t     suck each other off. \t \n[16]\t \n[17]\t \tJOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down \tthe street. \t \tIRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them, \tand shouts out to them: \t \n[18]\t     Go ahead -- that's all you're good \t     for -- to go out and leave me here \t     like a dog. You and your brother! \t     You don't even look like brothers. \t     You look like faggots! That's what \t     you look like -- faggots! \t \tJAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that \tIRMA must be shouting at someone else. \t \tShe throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street. \t ", "Eddie": "", "Eagan": "\n[1]\t      Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half. \t \tJAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the \tcustomary adjustments, EAGAN calls out: \t \n[2]\t      Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one \t      fourth. \t \tThere's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles. \t \n[3]\t      Ok. This is official. \t \tLAMOTTA stares at JANIRO. \t \n[4]\t      LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose. \t \tJAKE throws JANIRO a kiss. \t \n[5]\t      Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds. \t \tJOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the \tscale. The REPORTERS crowd around. \t \n[6]\t      Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds. \t \tJAKE'S HANDLERS urge him with words of encouragement as they \twalk toward his dressing room. \t \n[7]\t      I'd like to talk to Jake a minute. \t \n[8]\t      I suppose you heard what \t      everybody's been saying, Jake. \t \n[9]\t      You were a big favorite in this \t      fight. Then two days ago the odds \t      start jumping all over the place \t      until you're a 12-5 underdog. \t \n[10]\t      Now the fight's off the books \t      altogether. \t      Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet \t      down on this fight. Some people are \t      saying you're going into the tank. \t \n[11]\t      I want to believe you, LaMotta. \t \n[12]\t      That's all I wanted to hear. \t \tJAKE glares at EAGAN as the COMMISSIONER walks away. \t ", "Tommy": "\n[1]\t      Jake, sit down for a minute. \t \tJAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods \tback. \t \n[2]\t \t      Fuckin' kid! You're the best \t      fuckin' fighter around. Loved what \t      you did to Satterfield. Them \t      \"moulan yans\" -- forget about it. \t      They're all afraid to fight you. \t \n[3]\t      How you feelin'? Ok?

Ok? \t \n[7]\t      All right, lemme ask you something. \t      Let's say I was a good friend of \t      yours. And I was telling you I was \t      gonna bet a lot of money on you in \t      this Janiro fight. What would you \t      tell me? \t ", "Como": "\n[1]\t      All rightg I don't have to hear any \t      more. I think I understand what \t      happened. I understand it was your \t      brother's wife and there was \t      probably a misunderstanding. I'm \t      not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have \t      acted the way he did. But, Joey, \t      you don't raise your hands. You \t      don't do that kind of thing. This \t      time we forget about it but no more \t      after this. You understand? \t \n[2]\t      All right, you guys, shake hands. \t \tSALVY, JOEY, and PATSY shake hands. \t \n[3]\t      Go 'head. Be friends.

Can't you \t      talk? You got like a funny \t      attitude. I can't figure you out, \t      Joey. What's with you and the quick \t      answers? You wanna get outa here \t      fast? \t \n[6]\t      Look Joey, I wanna tell you \t      something. \t      Your brother ain't gonna get \t      nowhere without us -- nowhere. And \t      I'm tellin' you between the two of \t      us, it's gettin' to the point where \t      it's gettin' to be a real \t      embarrassment to me, a real \t      embarrassment. \t \n[7]\t      He's an embarrassment because \t      Frankie and the other guys are \t      expectin' me to do something about \t      it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I \t      can't deliver a kid from my own \t      neighborhood. Why's he make it so \t      hard on himself? He comes to me, I \t      can make it easier for him. \t \n[8]\t      Make it on his own? Does he know \t      the kind of money involved? I mean \t      the real money. He thinks he's \t      gonna become champ on his own? \t      We're gonna sit by and see some nut \t      come in there and hold one of the \t      most important titles in the world? \t      A nut who don't listen to nobody or \t      respect nobody? Is he really crazy? \t      Listen, Joey, you understand, you \t      tell him. I don't care how great he \t      is or how colorful. He could beat \t      all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all \t      the Janiros he wants to. He ain't \t      gonna get a shot at the title \t      without us. I'm not askin' you to \t      do another thing except get that \t      message into that thick head! \t \n[9]\t      Hey champ! \t \n[10]\t      You just take it easy, now.

He says goodbye to everyone in the living \troom. He goes over and kisses VICKIE. JAKE watches this from \tthe bedroom doorway. \t \n[13]\t \t      Look at her. As beautiful as \t      always.

Jake is makin' it hard \t     on himself. Tommy wants him with \t     us. It's as simple as that. \t \tThey stop at the doorway. \t \n[5]\t     Talk some sense into him, will ya? \t     You're still his brother. \t     If he ain't gonna listen to you, he \t     ain't gonna listen to nobody! \t \n[6]\t     Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget. \t \n[7]\t \t     Hey Joey -- \t \tJOEY waves back. \t \n[8]\t \t     Jake, how you doin'? \t \tJAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that \the's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same \tand becomes a bit nervous. \t \tSALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like \tto. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also. \t \tJAKE goes to JOEY's corner. \t \n[9]\t \t     Hey Joey, we better go.

JAKE is cold towards SALVY. \t \tSALVY goes on his way to COMO's table. \t \tAs SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE. \t \n[11]\t      Bet on him three times.
