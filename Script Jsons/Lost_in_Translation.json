I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia. \n[35]What do you do? \n[36]What did you study? \n[37]Oh, what do you do with that? \n[38]It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though. \n[39]Thanks. \n[40]Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet? \n[41]   \n[42](awkward, but glad to run into her \n[43]No, how about you? \n[44]I'm here for the week. \n[45]Ok. \n[46]   \n[47]\n[48] \n[49]A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this? \n[50]I read it, too. \n[51]Hi, Charlie. \n[52]No way. \n[53]Ok. \n[54]I will. \n[55]Are you ok? \n[56]I know. I don't either. \n[57]   \n[58]Lydia? \n[59]Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it. \n[60]He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was... \n[61]Yeah, its really different here. \n[62]It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep. \n[63]I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning . \n[64]  \n[65] \n[66]Charlotte, who? \n[67]Of course. \n[68]Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs. \n[69]I see them every morning. \n[70]     \n[71]Hans was very attentive to you. \n[72]No, its easy. \n[73]I don't know. \n[74]But the first time I saw you was in the elevator. \n[75]Yeah, you don't remember? \n[76]No, you smiled. \n[77]I know, I kind of blend in here. \n[78]I don't know. My fax said \"have a good fright\". \n[79]Ok, whatever you want. \n[80]No, I was looking at you. \n[81]I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix. \n[82]No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show. \n[83]You're possessive. \n[84]No, yes, it does... \n[85]Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way... \n[86]You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing. \n[87]That's ok. \n[88]It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor. \n[89]We established that we have no communication. \n[90]We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything. \n[91]When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying. \n[92]But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you. \n[93]Where'd you grow up? \n[94]I know. \n[95]You are. \n[96]Because that would be too easy. \n[97]   \n[98]Hello? \n[99]Ok. \n[100] \n[101]Miss Kawasaki?

Bob \u0097 Charlie Brown. \n[72]His real name's Hayashi, but someone started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie Brown. They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, I don't even know his real name, or why I call him that. \n[73]Hi. \n[74] \n[75]Thanks, you guys should come back sometime. \n[76]What do you feel like singing, Bob? \n[77]You bite your nails? \n[78]I could cut the ones that are left for you. \n[79]Hans?

Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road... \n[99]Oh, for her show? \n[100]Oh. \n[101]I know. \n[102]I'm stuck. Does it get easier. \n[103]Yeah? But look at you. \n[104]I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet... \n[105]But, I'm mean. \n[106]And marriage, does that get easier? \n[107]Did that help? Did you learn anything? \n[108]Oh. \n[109]That's too scary. \n[110] \n[111]That's nice.

I knocked into something the other day... \n[122]It's bad isn't it? \n[123]You think so? \n[124]Is that for me? \n[125] \n[126]How long have you been here? \n[127]C'mon, let's go. \n[128](like she's said it a million times \n[129] \n[130]No. \n[131]Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs... \n[132]   \n[133]Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good...

Did you know that? \n[138]The Jazz singer? The red-head? \n[139]Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties. \n[140]I can't tell the difference? \n[141]A coke. \n[142]Around. \n[143]They're not going to play the whole album, are they? \n[144]  \n[145]That lunch was the worst, huh. \n[146]When are you leaving? \n[147] \n[148]Well, I mean it more now. \n[149]I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime. \n[150]I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band. \n[151]54? \n[152]  \n[153]Hi, Bob. \n[154]Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down. \n[155]Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave? \n[156]That's it? \n[157]You're leaving right now? \n[158]Well... have a good flight. \n[159] \n[160]    \n[161] ", "Sausalito": "", "Guitar": "", "Bellboy": ""}}
