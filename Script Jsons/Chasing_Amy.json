I'm sure \t\t\tyou can dry your eyes on all those fat \t\t\tchecks you rake in.  \n[13]\t\t\tNope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at \t\t\tall.  There's very little market for \t\t\thearts and flowers in this spandex- \t\t\tclad, big pecs, big tits, big guns \t\t\tfield.  If I sell two issues, I feel \t\t\tlike John Grisham.  \n[14]\t\t\tBubbly guy like that, it's hard to \t\t\tfigure out why.  \n[15]\t\t\tThat's not love.  \n[16]\t\t\tThat out there!  That's fleeting.  \n[17]\t\t\tUh-huh.  You wanna hear about love! \t\t\tOh, I'll tell you about love.  \n[18]\t\t\tThe story.  The original love story.  \n[19]\t\t\tNope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a \t\t\tmillionaire.  \n[20]\t\t\tI kid you not.  \n[21]\t\t\tAll through high school, he dated this \t\t\tone girl.  They  were inseparable. \t\t\tAnd when they graduated, she went off \t\t\tto Carnegie Mellon...  \n[22]\t\t\tI'm impressed.  So he stays in the \t\t\thome town, and they begin their long- \t\t\tdistance relationship.  The plan is, \t\t\ton the  third Sunday of every month, \t\t\the'll train out, spend a week then \t\t\ttrain back They do this for four \t\t\tyears.  \n[23]\t\t\tNot nearly finished.  Two months \t\t\tbefore she's going to graduate, he's \t\t\tgot this job digging graves, and he \t\t\tcomes across...  \n[24]\t\t\tA steamer trunk containing silver \t\t\tingots.  \n[25]\t\t\tMany, many silver ingots.  Now, my \t\t\tmother's uncle being quite the \t\t\tingenious chap - he buries the trunk \t\t\tagain and heads up to the main office, \t\t\twhere he proceeds to purchase a \t\t\tcemetery plot.  Guess which one?  \n[26]\t\t\tSo now he owns the plot and all of its \t\t\tcontents.  Two  days later, my \t\t\tmother's uncle is worth three million.  \n[27]\t\t\tNot even close.  Inside the steamer \t\t\ttrunk, stenciled into the wood, or \t\t\tsomething like that, is a curse.  \n[28]\t\t\tNot that kind of curse.  A cryptic \t\t\tcurse \"Great fortune means great loss\" \t\t\tit said.  \n[29]\t\t\tThe same kind of asshole that buries \t\t\tsilver ingots.  The day my mother's \t\t\tuncle is heading out to see the girl, \t\t\the stops at his accountant's to grab \t\t\tsome cash, and winds up missing his \t\t\ttrain.  So he has to take the next one \t\t\t- which he does - and he gets there an \t\t\thour later than his usual time of \t\t\tarrival, whereupon he sees lights.  \n[30]\t\t\tIt seems that while she was standing \t\t\ton the platform waiting that extra \t\t\thour for my mother's uncle to show up, \t\t\tthe girl was dragged into the bushes \t\t\tby an unknown assailant, raped and \t\t\tgutted.  \tHolden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.  \n[31]\t\t\tThe assailant was never apprehended.  \n[32]\t\t\tYes, and here's why: my mother's uncle \t\t\trode that train every day for the rest \t\t\tof his life.  One day up, the next day \t\t\tback.  Did that 'till the day he died. \t\t\tHe donated the fortune he'd acquired \t\t\tto the train station in Pittsburgh, to \t\t\thave a well-lit terminal built. \t\t\tThe train line let him ride for free \t\t\tafter that.  \n[33]\t\t\tThat's my love story.  \tAlyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed. \tHe looks out the window.  \n[34]\t\t\tI told you It wasn't love. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI gotta split.  It was really nice \t\t\tmeeting you.  I wish you the best of \t\t\tluck with your book. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tTell Hooper I'll call him later.  And \t\t\ttell your friend to calm down.  \tAlyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two \tbeats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an \t'Everything's Archie' comic between them.  \n[35]\t\t\tWell, well, well - Bluntman himself. \t\t\tOr should I call you Chronic!  \n[36]\t\t\tFrom a former home-town girl, to \t\t\tMister Home-Town himself.  \n[37]\t\t\tMiddletown, N.J.  \n[38]\t\t\tI know.  Hooper told me.  \n[39]\t\t\tYou graduate from Hudson?  \n[40]\t\t\tI went to North.  Also eighty eight.  \n[41]\t\t\tQuiz me.  \n[42]\t\t\tI wrote my name on the wall.  \n[43]\t\t\tLost my virginity there.  \n[44]\t\t\tEden Prairie of Menlo Park!  \n[45]\t\t\tMy best friend fucked a dead guy in \t\t\tthe back room.  \n[46]\t\t\tI did.  Before she was committed.  \n[47]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo, this is the 'Rog'.  \n[48]\t\t\tPretty slim.  I haven't been back to \t\t\tthe 'burbs since my friend's funeral.  \n[49]\t\t\tAnother friend - Julie Dwyer.  She \t\t\tdied in the..  \n[50]\t\t\tSo well.  \n[51]\t\t\tBut I can tap. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat was the Buffalo Two-Step.  \n[52]\t\t\tThat's what six years of tap lessons \t\t\tyields.  \n[53]\t\t\tCoulda been worse - we could have not \t\t\tmet at all.  \tHolden looks at her.  \n[54]\t\t\tShe is such a twat.  \tThe crowd cheers.  Alyssa laughs.  She turns to the band \tand says something which they nod.  She turns back to the \tcrowd.  \n[55]\t\t\tAlright.  I should dedicate this, \t\t\tright? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is for that special someone our \t\t\tthere.  \tHolden smiles.  Banky joins him.  Holden glances at him. \tBanky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.  \tThe band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins.  \tAlyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is \textremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making \tdirect eye contact with...  \tHolden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced, \tBanky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty \tGIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's \tperformance.  \tAlyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out \tthere. \tThe song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. \tIt's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur \tof whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but \tAlyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the \tcrowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, \turging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the \tstage.  \tHolden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- \tshucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps \tforward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is \tsuddenly taken aback.  \tAlyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall \tinto a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.  \tHolden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across \this face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and \tfor the first time, we get the distinct impression that \tthis is a lesbian bar...  \tThere are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks. \tBanky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.  \n[56]\t\t\tUh-oh - better knock it off: we're \t\t\tgetting a man excited.  \n[57]\t\t\tNo, I should apologize.  I don't \t\t\tusually get all mushy in public.  But \t\t\tit's been awhile since I've seen Kim \t\t\there.  \n[58]\t\t\tLike I'd have to go through that much \t\t\teffort  \n[59]\t\t\tGo ahead.  I'll watch from here.  \n[60]\t\t\tDon't be such a rag.  I have to sit \t\t\there and work up the desire to fuck \t\t\tyou later.  \n[61]\t\t\tYes?  \n[62]\t\t\tAnd?  \n[63]\t\t\tIt's okay.  Secretly, all I really \t\t\twant is to be the center of attention. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI've never used a snap-on.  \n[64]\t\t\tLet me ask you a question - can men \t\t\t'fuck' each other!  \n[65]\t\t\tIn your estimation.  \n[66]\t\t\tSo for you, to 'fuck' means to \t\t\tpenetrate.  You're used to the more \t\t\ttraditional definition - you inside \t\t\tsome girl you've duped, jack-hammering \t\t\taway, not noticing that bored look in \t\t\ther eyes.  \n[67]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t'Fucking' is nor limited to \t\t\tpenetration, Banky. For me it \t\t\tdescribes any sex when it's not \t\t\ttotally about love.  I don't love Kim, \t\t\tbut I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't \t\t\tlove every girl you sleep with.  \n[68]\t\t\tBut I'll bet it's different with the \t\t\tones you love.  I'll bet you go the \t\t\tfull nine when it's not just a quick \t\t\tfix - like you go down on them longer \t\t\tor something.  \n[69]\t\t\tWhat?!?!  \n[70]\t\t\tIf you say the smell, so help me, I'll \t\t\tslug you.  \n[71]\t\t\tAt least you blame yourself for your \t\t\tsexual inadequacies.  \n[72]\t\t\tNo, he's got a point.  That's how I \t\t\twas in high school - I was nervous, \t\t\tand inhibited about being eaten out. \t\t\tBut by the time I got to college, that \t\t\tall changed.  I loosened up.  Not only \t\t\tdid I learn to communicate - I learned \t\t\tto be bossy. \t\t\tI was like one of those guys at the \t\t\tairport with those big flash lights - \t\t\twaving them this way, directing them \t\t\tthat way, telling them when to stop.  \n[73]\t\t\tPermanent injuries?  \n[74]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI got that beat. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI got that beat. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tSophomore year.  I'm going down on \t\t\tCynthia Slater in her dorm room after \t\t\twe went club-hopping.  I'm totally \t\t\tdrunk, and in the middle of it, I fall \t\t\tasleep - right there in her lap.  She \t\t\tgot so mad, she digs her heel into my \t\t\tback, right there. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat's permanent.  \n[75]\t\t\t\t(throws up her leg, and rolls \t\t\t\tup pants \t\t\tSenior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm \t\t\teating our Missy Kurt in her brother's \t\t\tcar.  She's laying across the back \t\t\tseat, and I'm half-hanging out of the \t\t\tcar, my knees on the ground.  She's \t\t\tflailing around, and she knocks the \t\t\tparking brake off.  The car starts \t\t\trolling down the hill, and my right \t\t\tknee is cut up all to shit like a \t\t\tkiddy's scissor class cut it up for \t\t\tpaper dolls.  \tBanky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on \this arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim \tre-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.  \n[76]\t\t\tSomebody told me that they make comic \t\t\tbooks here, and I've got an idea for \t\t\tthis story about a guy who comes to a \t\t\tclub and high-tails it when he finds \t\t\tout this girl is pay.  Any interest in \t\t\ta story like that!  \tHolden smiles.    \n[77]\n[78]\t\t\tThat's great, isn't it?  \n[79]\t\t\tBut you don't.  \tThey come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.  \n[80]\t\t\tWell when are you going to do that?  \n[81]\t\t\tDo you know how pretty you are?  \n[82]\t\t\tYou're a pretty man.  \n[83]\t\t\tOh.  I get it.  I'm into girls, so I \t\t\thave to find all men repulsive or \t\t\tsomething.  \n[84]\t\t\tAren't there some men that you find \t\t\tattractive?  Granted, not enough to \t\t\tsleep with, but still - just handsome \t\t\tor something!  \n[85]\t\t\tWell it's the same thing.  I look at \t\t\tyou and just find you really handsome. \t\t\tAnd you know, it has very little to do \t\t\twith your look, per-se.  Your look is \t\t\tfine, don't get me wrong.  But it's \t\t\tmore your outlook.  The things you \t\t\tsay, the way you see things.  It's... \t\t\tI don't know... attractive,  \tHolden looks away, embarrassed,  \n[86]\t\t\tI weirded you our the other night  \n[87]\t\t\tCome on.  \n[88]\t\t\tDo you want to talk about it!  \n[89]\t\t\tI like you.  I haven't liked a man in \t\t\ta long time.  And I'm not a man-hater \t\t\tor something.  It's just been some \t\t\ttime since I've been exposed to a man \t\t\tthat didn't immediately live-into a \t\t\tstereotype of some sort.  And I want \t\t\tyou to feel comfortable with me, \t\t\tbecause I want us to be friends.  So \t\t\tif there are things you'd like to \t\t\tknow, it's okay to ask me.  \n[90]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhy men?  \n[91]\t\t\tIf that's the only reason you're \t\t\tattracted to women - because it's the \t\t\tstandard..  \n[92]\t\t\tSo you've never been curious about \t\t\tmen?  \n[93]\t\t\tYou know what I mean.  \n[94]\t\t\tWhy not!  \n[95]\t\t\tBecause...?  \n[96]\t\t\tAnd that's how I feel.  I've never \t\t\treally been attracted to men.  I'm \t\t\tmore comfortable with the idea of \t\t\tgirls.  \n[97]\t\t\tNo.  \n[98]\t\t\tYou're saying a person's a virgin \t\t\tuntil they've had intercourse with a \t\t\tmember of the opposite sex?  \n[99]\t\t\tAgain with the standards.  I think \t\t\tvirginity is lost when you make love \t\t\tfor the first time.  \n[100]\t\t\tWhy?  Why only then?  \n[101]\t\t\tSo if a virgin is raped, then she's \t\t\tstill a virgin?  \n[102]\t\t\tBut rape is not the standard.  So \t\t\tshe's had sex, but not the standard \t\t\tidea of sex.  Hence, according to \t\t\tyour definition, she'd still be a \t\t\tvirgin.  \n[103]\t\t\tThen I lost my virginity at ten, \t\t\tbecause I fell on a fence post when I \t\t\twas ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I \t\t\thave to tell people that I lost it to \t\t\ta wooden post I'd known my whole young \t\t\tlife?  \n[104]\t\t\tPhysical penetration or emotional?  \n[105]\t\t\tWell, I fell in love hard with Caitlin \t\t\tBree when we were in high school.  \n[106]\t\t\tWe had sex.  \n[107]\t\t\tI move to have that remark stricken \t\t\tfrom the record.  On account of it \t\t\tmakes you come off as completely naive \t\t\tand infantile.  \n[108]\t\t\tDid I hold up a finger? \t\t\t\t  \n[109]\t\t\tOur bodies are built to pass a child, \t\t\tfor Christ's sake.  \n[110]\t\t\tSure.  But in a good way.  And it's \t\t\tonly a once-in-awhile thing - reserved \t\t\tfor really special occasions.  \n[111]\t\t\tTongue only.  \n[112]\t\t\tLet's go.  \tShe exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes \tback in.  \n[113]\t\t\tCome on.  \n[114]\t\t\tI hope for the sake of the women \t\t\tyou've dated that you're only this \t\t\tquick in returning calls.  \n[115]\t\t\tOhhh.  Why!  \n[116]\t\t\tShit.  \n[117]\t\t\tMy sister's at my parents'.  I was \t\t\tgonna go see her.  \n[118]\t\t\tYeah.  But I was staying all weekend, \t\t\tand I wanted to hang our with you. \t\t\tThis sucks.  \n[119]\t\t\tI don't do southern con's - all the \t\t\tchicks have that annoying drawl.  You \t\t\tknow how hard it is nor to laugh when \t\t\tsomeone moans \"Fuhhk me\"?  \n[120]\t\t\tReally?  \n[121]\t\t\tIf you come pick me up, I'll be your \t\t\tbest friend.  \n[122]\t\t\tI'm not there.  I'm at a friend's - in \t\t\tthe Village.  Corner of Houston and \t\t\tMercer.  Number eighty six, apartment \n[123]\t\t\tYou're so easy.  \tThey hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits \tquickly.  \tC11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks \ton.  \n[124]\t\t\tDon't mind her.  That's just her way a \t\t\tsaying hello.  \n[125]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're such an asshole.  \n[126]\t\t\tOhhh - you look so cute!  \tShe heads down the stairs.  \n[127]\t\t\tJust an occasional friend.  \n[128]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tRemember this! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHer's is even bigger than that.  \tShe smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the \tdoor.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his \tfingers.    \n[129]\t\t\tYou were raised Catholic, right?  \n[130]\t\t\tBaptist.  \n[131]\t\t\tPlease There was no time to be bad - \t\t\twe were too busy saying 'Jesus'.  \n[132]\t\t\tSomewhere along the line.  It's a \t\t\tgradual transition to make - from \t\t\tdoing what the majority does to taking \t\t\ta leap of faith and doing what feels \t\t\tmore natural.  Everything helps - from \t\t\tthe way you were handled as a kid, to \t\t\tthe way the boys acted in third grade, \t\t\tto the shoes you wore at your freshman \t\t\tprom.  \n[133]\t\t\tWell they were really tight.    \n[134]\t\t\tFamously.  \n[135]\t\t\tSo it would seem.  \n[136]\t\t\tI'm into women.  \n[137]\t\t\tWhen I was nine I had a crush on Scott \t\t\tBaio.  \n[138]\t\t\t...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.  \n[139]\t\t\tI read somewhere that guys who play \t\t\thockey are merely making up for penile \t\t\tdeficiencies by carrying big sticks.  \n[140]\t\t\tExplain this again.  \n[141]\t\t\tStayed out late, smoked pot, screwed \t\t\taround.  \n[142]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis looks complicated.  \n[143]\t\t\tWhat do you do with the prize tickets?  \n[144]\t\t\tThen what's the point?  \n[145]\t\t\tAnd you question my lifestyle.  \n[146]\t\t\tWhy not just walk up there and put it \t\t\tin the fifty every time?  \n[147]\t\t\tOh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had \t\t\tno idea.  \n[148]\t\t\tThis is where you take straight chicks \t\t\ton dates?  \n[149]\t\t\tI don't know.  I'm starting to get a \t\t\ttingle in my bottom. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tTen.  \n[150]\t\t\tGot laid  \tHolden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the \tceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine. \tAlyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.  \n[151]\t\t\tSome more of that skill you were \t\t\ttelling me about?  \n[152]\t\t\tNo way.  I want a cheap prize. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo your friend's quite the homophobe.  \n[153]\t\t\tI'm not talking about his infantile \t\t\thang-up with me.  I'm talking about \t\t\twhen you two were playing that game. \t\t\tEverytime he swore - when his players \t\t\tmessed up, he called them cocksuckers, \t\t\the referred to the players as queers, \t\t\the called you a cock-teaser...  \n[154]\t\t\tI know you think it means nothing, and \t\t\tit may in fact be unintentional, but \t\t\tit's ugly all the same.  \n[155]\t\t\tSo he slams the gay community?  \n[156]\t\t\tI'm not.  But what is that saying?  \n[157]\t\t\tIt's passive/agressive gay-bashing.  \n[158]\t\t\tHow casually did it roll off his \t\t\ttongue?  And that's how he expresses \t\t\this anger?  By calling people faggots?  \n[159]\t\t\tI think you're just so used to it that \t\t\tit rolls off your back.  I've heard \t\t\tthe two of you play your little rank \t\t\tout game where one insists the other \t\t\tis gay. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\"You're a faggot.  No, you're a \t\t\tfaggot.\"  It's cute and all to watch \t\t\tyou go at it like grade-schooler, but \t\t\tit's also offensive - labeling and \t\t\tducking the label of being gay as if \t\t\tit were the scarlet fucking letter.  \n[160]\t\t\tYeah, but that's what's known as \t\t\tempowerment/disempowerment.  I call \t\t\tmyself a dyke so it's not too \t\t\tdevastating when some throwback \t\t\tscreams it at me as I'm leaving a bar \t\t\tat night. \t\t\tSame for Hooper - by calling himself a \t\t\tfaggot, he steals the thunder away \t\t\tfrom the mouthy jerks of this world \t\t\twho'd like to beat him to it.  But the \t\t\tdifference between us having it and \t\t\tyour friend saying it is miles wide. \t\t\tWe say it to mask the pain - you say \t\t\tit for lack of a better expression at \t\t\tany given moment.  No Holden, we do \t\t\tnot live in a more tolerant age.  And \t\t\tif you think that's the case, then \t\t\tyou've been in the suburbs way too \t\t\tlong to be resuscitated.  \tHolden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.  \n[161]\t\t\tBut you know what? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI have more faith in you than that. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tCome on - I want my cheap prize.    \n[162]\t\t\tOh really?  \n[163]\t\t\t\t(drops her fork and wipes her \t\t\t\thands \t\t\tWe're leaving!  \n[164]\t\t\tI've got a little business to conduct.  \tShe grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.  Holden \twatches her, then follows.  \tA23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does \tHolden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the \t'just wait' finger.  The CASHIER turns to her.  \n[165]\t\t\tAre you an authorized deal-maker in \t\t\tthis establishment?  Do you have the \t\t\tpower to negotiate.  \n[166]\t\t\tI want to haggle over the price of \t\t\tfine art.  \n[167]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThere.  By the kitchen.  That \t\t\tpainting.  \n[168]\t\t\tThe price tag says seventy five.  \n[169]\t\t\tI'll give you fifty.  \n[170]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tAlyssa Jones.  Pleased to meet you.  \n[171]\t\t\tI'm only trying to conduct a \t\t\ttransaction.  We're not opponents.  \n[172]\t\t\tAh-ha! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tNow we're haggling.    \n[173]\t\t\tIt was looking shakey when he told me \t\t\tthe artist was a blind cripple with a \t\t\thump-back, but I held my ground. \t\t\tThere's no room for sympathy in the \t\t\tbuyer's market.  \n[174]\t\t\tI'm not.  You are.  \n[175]\t\t\tYou're going to hang it in your house. \t\t\tI bought it for you.  \n[176]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm serious.  \tHolden stares at her.  \n[177]\t\t\tBecause it's captured the moment. \t\t\tIt'll be a constant reminder - not \t\t\tjust of tonight, but of our \t\t\tintroduction, the building of our \t\t\tfriendship, everything.  Make no \t\t\tmistake about it my Friend - it's a \t\t\tgift to you, from me, so you'll always \t\t\tremember us.  \tHolden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the \tright.    \n[178]\t\t\tWhy are we stopping?  \n[179]\t\t\tCan't take what?  \n[180]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou love me.  \n[181]\t\t\tGet back in the car and get out of \t\t\there.  \n[182]\t\t\tY'ep.  \n[183]\t\t\tHere's my comment fuck you.  \n[184]\t\t\tThat was so unfair.  You know how \t\t\tunfair that was.  \n[185]\t\t\tNo, it's unfortunate that you're in \t\t\tlove with me.  It's  unfair that you \t\t\tfelt the fucking need to unburden your \t\t\tsoul about it.  Do you remember for a \t\t\tfucking second who I am?  \n[186]\t\t\tOh, it's that simple?  You fall in \t\t\tlove with me and want a romantic \t\t\trelationship, nothing changes for you \t\t\twith the exception of feeling hunky- \t\t\tdorey all the time.  But what about- \t\t\tme?  It's not that simple, is it?  I \t\t\tcan't just get into a relationship \t\t\twith you without throwing my whole \t\t\tfucking world into upheaval!  \n[187]\t\t\tPeriod of adjustment?!? \t\t\t\t \n[188]\t\t\tGo home, Holden.  \tShe walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he \tturns and heads back to his car. \tAs he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, \tAlyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with \thim, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her.  \tAnd there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched \tkissing.    \n[189]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI take it that's not good.  \n[190] \tAn all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help \tAlyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  Tory \tletters a page.  Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork. \tDalia drinks wine.  Alyssa paints the cover.  \n[191]\t\t\tAnd miss these last minute cram \t\t\tsessions with my nearest and dearest? \t\t\tNever.  \n[192]\t\t\t'Shacking up!' Please. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm so in love!  \tEveryone aww's.  Alyssa buries her face, giggling.  \n[193]\t\t\tI know.  I know -I feel like such a \t\t\tgoon.  But I can't help it - we have \t\t\tsuch a great time together.  \n[194]\t\t\tIt's not her.  It's someone you guys \t\t\tdon't know.  \n[195]\t\t\tThey're not.  From around here.  \n[196]\t\t\tFor your information, they don't have \t\t\tbig hair or wear acid wash. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThey're from my home town.  \tDalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously.  \n[197]\t\t\tWhat?  What are you talking about? \t\t\tI'm not even.  \n[198]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHolden.  \tAll four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.  She \tstops painting.  \n[199]\t\t\tHe's not like a typical man.  He's \t\t\treally sweet to me, and we relate so \t\t\twell.  You guys'd love him, really.  \tThey stare at Alyssa.  Then Dalia gets up.  \n[200]\t\t\tDon't even tell me you want to do it \t\t\tagain.  \n[201]\t\t\tBecause you were giving me that look, \t\t\tand I got wet...  \n[202]\t\t\tWhy not You?  \n[203]\t\t\tI see you've been taking notes. \t\t\tHistorically, yes  that's true.  \n[204]\t\t\tI've given that a lot of thought, you \t\t\tknow?  I mean, now that I'm being \t\t\tostracized by my friends, I've had a \t\t\tlot of time to think about all of \t\t\tthis.  And what I've come up with is \t\t\treally simple: I came to this on my \t\t\tterms.  I didn't just heed what I was \t\t\ttaught, you  know?  Men and women \t\t\tshould be together, it's the natural \t\t\tway - that kind of thing.  I'm not \t\t\twith you because of what family, \t\t\tsociety, life tried to instill in me \t\t\tfrom day one.  The way the world is - \t\t\thow seldom you meet that one person \t\t\twho gets you... it's so rare.   My \t\t\tparents didn't really have it.  There \t\t\twas no example set for me in the world \t\t\tof male/female relation ships.  And to \t\t\tcut oneself off from finding that \t\t\tperson - to immediately half your \t\t\toptions by eliminating the possibility \t\t\tof finding that one person within your \t\t\town gender... that just seemed stupid. \t\t\tSo I didn't.  And by leaving my \t\t\toptions open, I was branded 'gay', \t\t\twhich to me was no big deal - labels \t\t\tare labels, you know?  They define \t\t\twhat you do, not who you are, I guess. \t\t\tBut \t\tthen you come along.  You - \t\t\tthe one least likely; I mean, you were \t\t\ta guy.  \n[205]\t\t\tAnd while I was falling for you, I put \t\t\ta ceiling on that, because you were a \t\t\tguy. \t\t\tUntil I remembered why I opened the \t\t\tdoor to women in the first place - to \t\t\tnot limit the likelihood of finding \t\t\tthat one person who'd compliment me so \t\t\tcompletely.  And so here we are, I was \t\t\tthorough when I looked for you, and I \t\t\tfeel justified lying in your arms - \t\t\tbecause I got here on my terms, and \t\t\thave no question that there was \t\t\tsomeplace I didn't look.  And that \t\t\tmakes all the difference.  \n[206]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[207]\t\t\tWhat luster?  \n[208]\t\t\tYou're not the right man. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're just the one.  \tShe snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares \tat the ceiling.  \n[209]\t\t\tSince most of these people are rooting \t\t\tfor the home team, I'm going to cheer \t\t\tfor the visitors.  I'm a big visitors \t\t\tfan - especially the kind that make \t\t\tcoffee for you in the morning before \t\t\tthey go. \t\t\t\t(smiles at Holden; no \t\t\t\tresponse \t\t\tThat was a joke.  A little wacky \t\t\twordplay?  \n[210]\t\t\tWas I being too obscure?  The kind \t\t\tthat - until recently - had no dicks \t\t\tand would spend the night.  \n[211]\t\t\tOh, yeah. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling \t\t\tor something!  \n[212]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSomething on your mind, Holden?  \n[213]\t\t\tIf I've been 'faithful' or something?  \n[214]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tOh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for \t\t\tyou. \t\t\t\t \n[215]\t\t\tAbout what?  \n[216]\t\t\tReally.  I'm sorry - you two left high \t\t\tschool behind how many years ago? \t\t\t\t(grabs his face and kisses \t\t\t\this cheek \t\t\tCan I put some of my books in your \t\t\tlocker? \t\t\t\t  \n[217]\t\t\t\t \n[218]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t'Finger Cuffs'?  \n[219]\t\t\tIt was?  Shit, damned if I can \t\t\tremember.  I'd look it up, but I threw \t\t\tall that shit our years ago? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhere'd you see a North yearbook?  \n[220]\t\t\tRick?  Sure.  We used to hang out in \t\t\thigh school. \t\t\t\t \n[221]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDate Rick Derris?  No.  We just hung \t\t\tout a lot.  \n[222]\t\t\tNo.  Me, Rick, and... um... what was \t\t\tthat guy's name...?  \n[223]\t\t\tYeah!  Cohee Lundin.  God, I haven't \t\t\tthought about that name in years.  \tON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls \tPlayer One's helmet off and punches him in the face.  \tHolden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his \tcompanion.  Alyssa's into the game.  \n[224]\t\t\tI remember those guys'd come over \t\t\talmost everyday after school.  They'd \t\t\tbug my sisters, look for porno tapes \t\t\tin my dad's closet, raid our fridge. \t\t\tThey really took advantage of my \t\t\tparents never being home.  \tON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and \tgut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's \tanger, so enthralled with the action is she.  \n[225]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis one day... Rick pulled out his \t\t\tdick and chased me around the house \t\t\twith it!  Right in front of Cohee!  I \t\t\tcouldn't believe it!  Guys are weird - \t\t\tI thought the whole size hang-up made \t\t\tyou all terrified to show your dicks \t\t\tto each other?  \tON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly \trights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a \tbarrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice.  \tHolden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's \tstill in the game.  \n[226]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI blew him while Cohee fucked me.  \tON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming \this fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out \tlike a geyser, and Two goes down hard.  \tHolden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around \tthem stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in \ttheir midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes.  \n[227]\t\t\tThat's what you wanted to hear, isn't \t\t\tit?  Isn't that what this little cross- \t\t\texamination of your's is about?  Well \t\t\ttry not to be so obvious about it next \t\t\ttime, there are subtler ways of \t\t\tbadgering a witness. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tAm I right?  \n[228]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf you wanted some background \t\t\tinformation on me, all you had to do \t\t\twas ask - I'd have gladly volunteered \t\t\tit.  You didn't have to play Hercules \t\t\tfucking Poirot!  \tShe storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander \twatches them go.  \n[229]\t\t\tYes Holden!  In fact, everything you \t\t\theard or dug up on me was probably \t\t\ttrue!  Yeah, I took on two guys at \t\t\tonce!  You want to hear some gems you \t\t\tmight not have unearthed - I took a \t\t\ttwenty six year old guy to my senior \t\t\tprom, and then left halfway through to \t\t\thave sex with him and Gwen Turner in \t\t\tthe back of a limo!  And the girl who \t\t\tgot caught in the shower with Miss \t\t\tMoffit, the gym teacher?  That was me! \t\t\tOr how about in college, when I let \t\t\tShannon Hamilton videotape us having \t\t\tsex - only to find out the next day \t\t\tthat he broadcast it on the campus \t\t\tcable station?!  They're all true - \t\t\tthose and so many more!  Didn't you \t\t\tknow?  I'm the queen of urban legend!  \n[230]\t\t\tEasily!  Some of it I did out of \t\t\tstupidity, some of it I did out of \t\t\twhat I thought was love, but - good or \t\t\tbad - they were my choices, and I'm \t\t\tnot making apologies for them now - \t\t\tnot to you or anyone!  And how dare \t\t\tyou try to lay a guilt trip on me \t\t\tabout it - in public, no less!  Who \t\t\tthe fuck do you think you are, you \t\t\tjudgemental prick?!  \n[231]\t\t\tHow are you supposed to feel about it? \t\t\tFeel what ever the fuck you want about \t\t\tit!  The only thing that really \t\t\tmatters is how you feel about me.  \n[232]\t\t\tWhy?  Because I had some sex?  \n[233]\t\t\tYes, Holden - that's all it was: some \t\t\tsex!  Most of it stupid high school \t\t\tsex, for Christ's sake!  Like you \t\t\tnever had sex in high school!  \n[234]\t\t\tI used them!  You don't think I \t\t\twould've let it happen if I hadn't \t\t\twanted it to, do you?!  I was an \t\t\texperimental girl, for Christ's sake! \t\t\tMaybe you knew early on that your \t\t\ttrack was from point 'a' to 'b' - but \t\t\tunlike you I wasn't given a fucking \t\t\tmap at birth, so I tried it all!  That \t\t\tis until we - that's you and I - got \t\t\ttogether, and suddenly, I was sated. \t\t\tCan't you take some fucking comfort in \t\t\tthat?  You turned out to be all I was \t\t\tever looking for - the missing piece \t\t\tin the big fucking puzzle! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tLook I'm sorry I let you believe that \t\t\tyou were the only guy I'd ever been \t\t\twith.  I should've been more honest. \t\t\tBut it seemed to make you feel special \t\t\tin a way that me telling you over and \t\t\tover again how incredible you are \t\t\twould never get across.  \tShe touches his face.  He pulls back.  She stares at him, \thurt and pissed.  \n[235]\t\t\tDo you mean to tell me that - while \t\t\tyou have zero problem with me sleeping \t\t\twith half the women in New York City - \t\t\tyou have some sort of half-assed, \t\t\tmealy-mouthed objection to pubescent \t\t\tantics, that took place almost ten \t\t\tyears ago?  What the fuck is your \t\t\tproblem?!?  \tHolden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.  \n[236]\t\t\tAnd what's that?  \n[237]\t\t\tFuck you.  \n[238]\t\t\tThat doesn't matter to me...  \n[239]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDon't.  \n[240]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tPlease don't say it.  \n[241]\t\t\tNo.  \tHolden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.  \n[242]\t\t\tYou did?  What does that say about me?  \n[243]\t\t\tYou don't want this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou really don't want this.  Trust me.  \n[244]\t\t\t\t(inhales from her cigarette, \t\t\t\ttakes a beat \t\t\tI can't.  \tHolden moves to her side of the couch.  \n[245]\t\t\tOh Holden. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat time is over for me.  I've been \t\t\tthere.  I've done it.  And I didn't \t\t\tfind what I was looking for in any of \t\t\tit.  I found that in you - in us. \t\t\tDoing this won't help you forget about \t\t\tthe things you're hung up on.  It'll \t\t\tcreate more.  \n[246]\t\t\tNo, it will.  Maybe you'll see me \t\t\tdifferently from then on - maybe \t\t\tyou'll despise me for going along with \t\t\tit, once you're in the moment.  Maybe \t\t\tI'll moan differently and then you'll \t\t\tresent Banky, and become suspicious of \t\t\tus.  Or you'll alienate him because of \t\t\tit, and then grow to blame and hate me \t\t\tfor the deterioration of your \t\t\tfriendship.  Or what if- I sincerely \t\t\tdoubt it, but what if - I saw \t\t\tsomething in Banky that I never saw \t\t\tbefore, and fell in love with him and \t\t\tleft you.  I've been down roads like \t\t\tthis before; many times.  I know you \t\t\tfeel doing this will broaden your \t\t\thorizons and give you experience.  But \t\t\tI've had those experiences on my own. \t\t\tI can't accompany you on your's.  I'm \t\t\tpast that now. \t\t\t\t(touches his face; stares to \t\t\t\tcry \t\t\tOr maybe I just love you too much. \t\t\tAnd I feel hurt and let down that \t\t\tyou'd want to share me with anyone. \t\t\tBecause I never wanted to share you \t\t\t\t \t\t\tRegardless I can't be a part of this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tOr you.  Not anymore \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI love you.  I always will.  Know \t\t\tthat.  \tShe releases him, then slaps him.  \n[247]\t\t\tBut I'm not your fucking whore.  \tAlyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and \tdown.  \n[248]\t\t\tHe's your's again.  \tShe walks our of the studio.  The door closes behind her.  \tBanky and Holden stand there, silently.  Cut to black.  \n[249]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThanks for reading it.  \tThe Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.  \n[250]\t\t\tI'm fine, thanks,  \tThe Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her \tbag.  \n[251]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tOkay, who's next!  \tA comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a \tcomic book called 'Chasing Amy'.  \tShe leafs through it, not looking up.  \n[252]\t\t\tUm... This isn't one of mine.  \n[253]\t\t\tHi.  \n[254]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow've you been?  \n[255]\t\t\tGood \t\t\t\t \t\t\tNew issue's selling like crazy, for \t\t\tsome reason.  \n[256]\t\t\tThank you. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI haven't even seen this yet.  Did it \t\t\tjust come out?  \n[257]\t\t\tWill I enjoy it? \n[258]\t\t\tLooks Like a very personal story.  \n[259]\t\t\tYeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I \t\t\tjust saw this nun in line call this \t\t\tsmall child a cunt-rag.  \n[260]\t\t\tI will.  \n[261]\t\t\tOkay.  \tThey look at each other for a beat.  \n[262]\t\t\tReally nice to see you too.  \tHe walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves \tagain.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving \tthrough the thrall of fan-boys.  \tThe Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's \tgaze.  \n[263]\t\t\tHmm!  Oh.  Just some guy I knew.  \tShe watches him go for another beat, then.  \n[264]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNext \t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo what do you want to do tonight?  \tAnd as they fall into conversation, the show goes on. ", "Jones": "", "Holden": "\n[1]\t\t\tYippee.  \n[2]\t\t\tI know my name. \n[3]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is easy, alright!  And right now \t\t\tit pays the bills.  Just don't forget \t\t\tthat we're better than this. \n[4]\t\t\tYou bet. \tWe're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- \tsigning. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding \tHOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS - \tCREATORS OF \u0011BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large \tmock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner \tsuper-heroes who bear a \tstriking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly \tneighborhood drug \tdealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan. \n[5]\t\t\tI like to chink of them as \t\t\t\u0011Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet \t\t\t\u0011Vladimir and Estragon'. \n[6]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWho do I sign it to! \tBefore Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He \tlooks to his left and freaks. \tBanky is throttling the Collector from across the table. \tThe Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS \tpull them apart. Holden grabs Banky. \n[7]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tCould you get him out of here! \tThe Security Guards drag the collector away. \n[8]\t\t\tCan I explain the audience principle \t\t\tto you!  If you insult and accost \t\t\tthem, then we have no audience. \n[9]\t\t\tNeed I remind you... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tCurtain's in ten minutes. \n[10]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tBullshit!  Lando Calrissian was a \t\t\tblack man, and he got to fly the \t\t\tMillennium Falcon! \tHooper whips his head around, looking for the source of \tthe comment \n[11]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive \t\t\tblack role model in the realm of \t\t\tScience Fiction/Fantasy. \n[12]\t\t\tBut Vader turns, out to be Luke's \t\t\tfather.  And in Jedi, they become \t\t\tfriends. \n[13]\t\t\tHow do you manage to get away with \t\t\tthis all the time?  Shouldn't cops be \t\t\tbusting your head open right about \t\t\tnow? \n[14]\t\t\tYour publisher condones these \t\t\ttheatrics! \n[15]\t\t\t\t(shoots him a look; to \t\t\t\tAlyssa \t\t\tSorry about him.  He's dealing with \t\t\tbeing an inker. \n[16]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI really enjoy your book I'm surprised \t\t\twe've never met at any other Con's \t\t\tbefore. \n[17]\t\t\tWe'll go. \tBanky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to \tHooper. \n[18]\t\t\tHe's got a point.  Archie never did \t\t\tsettle on Betty or Veronica. \n[19]\t\t\tFor years now.  Started back in third \t\t\tgrade - a nun was teaching us about \t\t\tthe Blessed Trinity.  She's going on \t\t\tabout the three persons in one God \t\t\tthing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and \t\t\the just goes ballistic.  I guess it \t\t\twas too big for him to grasp.  They \t\t\tgot into this huge fight. \n[20]\t\t\tYou ever seen a nun call a small child \t\t\ta \u0011fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, \t\t\tShit like that's bound to happen when \t\t\tyou make a kid wear a matching tie and \t\t\tslacks everyday. \n[21]\t\t\tLimited to wine-tasting prior to mass. \t\t\tTurned me into a grade school \t\t\talcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell \t\t\tyou how many mornings after serous \t\t\tbenders\t\tI'd wake up next \t\t\tto strange priests. \n[22]\t\t\tSharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy- \t\t\tmolestation humor.  Probably why the \t\t\textended family quit inviting me to \t\t\tFirst Communion parties. \tAlyssa laughs.  Holden smiles. \n[23]\t\t\tNot professionally.  You know - only \t\t\tin bars.    \n[24]\t\t\tIt goes back to something my \t\t\tgrandmother told me when I was a kid. \t\t\t\"Holden,\" she said \"The big bucks are \t\t\tin dick and fart jokes.\"  She was a \t\t\tchurch-goer.  \n[25]\t\t\tI'm sorry - did I detect a note of \t\t\tbitter envy in there!  \n[26]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt's all about marketing.  Over- or \t\t\tunderweight guys who don't get laid - \t\t\tthey're our bread and butter.  People \t\t\tlike those two outside should be \t\t\tyours.  \tThrough the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the \thood of a car.  \n[27]\t\t\tAnd sadly, there are more of our core \t\t\taudience out there than yours. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tLook at that, though - kind of gives \t\t\tyou a little charge, to see two people \t\t\tin love.  And all over Banky's car, no \t\t\tless.  That car's seeing more action \t\t\tright now than it's seen in years.  \n[28]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou've gotta respect that kind of \t\t\tdisplay of affection.  It's crazy, \t\t\trude, self-absorbed - but it's love.  \n[29]\t\t\tSays you.  \n[30]\t\t\tFleeting.  \n[31]\t\t\tA story?  \n[32]\t\t\t'Doctor Zhivago'.  \n[33]\t\t\tGet out.  \n[34]\t\t\tExplain.  \n[35]\t\t\tIn Pittsburgh.  \n[36]\t\t\tThat is love.  \n[37]\t\t\tA stiff.  \n[38]\t\t\tGet out of here.  \n[39]\t\t\tClever.  \n[40]\t\t\tAt which time he marries the high \t\t\tschool sweetheart and lives happily \t\t\tever after.  \n[41]\t\t\tSomeone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new \t\t\tsteamer trunk.  \n[42]\t\t\tWhat kind of asshole writes that \t\t\tinside a steamer trunk!  \n[43]\t\t\tA hero's welcome for the new \t\t\tmillionaire.  \n[44]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat's a love story!!  \n[45]\t\t\tI should hope so.  Jesus, that's the \t\t\tsaddest tale I've ever heard.  \n[46]\t\t\tThose two aren't on the hood of \t\t\tBanky's car anymore.  \n[47]\t\t\tHuh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd \t\t\tcall you later.  \n[48]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat!  \n[49]\t\t\tWho?  \n[50]\t\t\tShe's alright.  \n[51]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMister Weatherbee wasn't really trying \t\t\tto fuck Archie, was he!  \tThey begin exiting.  \n[52]\t\t\tIt's the one across from the post \t\t\toffice.  \n[53]\t\t\tThanks. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat do you wanna do tonight!  \n[54]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou got a weird thing for Canadian \t\t\tmelodrama.  \n[55]\t\t\tBank-Hold-Up.  \tCROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper.  He's on a phone in a \n[56]\t\t\tWhere is it?  \n[57]\t\t\tI don't know, Hoop.  We're prepping \t\t\tthe next issue, and we've got our big \t\t\tM-TV meeting in the morning.  \n[58]\t\t\tTold who?  \n[59]\t\t\tAlyssa from last night Alyssa?  \n[60]\t\t\tI'll be there.  \n[61]\t\t\tHooper.  He invited me to a club.  \n[62]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNot that kind of a club.  \n[63]\t\t\t'We'?  You can't go.  He's setting me \t\t\tup with Alyssa.  \n[64]\t\t\tAnd I don't want you messing it up.  \n[65]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI just told you - it's not that kind \t\t\tof club.  \n[66]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow are you going to get home if I \t\t\thook up!  \n[67]\t\t\tLet me explain something to you, my \t\t\twitless chum the other night in that \t\t\tbar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a \t\t\tmoment, alright!  \n[68]\t\t\t\t(brings his two pointer \t\t\t\tfingers together \t\t\tWe shared a moment.  And in that \t\t\tmoment, one thing was made abundantly \t\t\tclear: this girl loves me, my friend. \t\t\tLoves-me.    \n[69]\t\t\tWhere is she?  \n[70]\t\t\tShe's got a boyfriend.  \n[71]\t\t\tThen what's to know?  \tHolden exits; They watch him go.  Banky looks around.  \n[72]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHey, hey, hey - you fucked up my \t\t\tcabbage-patch!  \n[73]\t\t\tCall me flattered.  I heard you sent \t\t\tme the invite to this little soiree'.  \n[74]\t\t\tYou're saying you're from the 'burbs!  \n[75]\t\t\tGet out of here!  I'm from Highlands!  \n[76]\t\t\tHow is it that we never ran into one \t\t\tanother?  \n[77]\t\t\tYeah.  Eighty eight.  \n[78]\t\t\tWhat a small fucking world.  So you \t\t\tknow the tri-town area!  \n[79]\t\t\tMiller Hill?  \n[80]\t\t\tSandy Hook?  \n[81]\t\t\tThis is so cool.  The mall!  \n[82]\t\t\tWait - here's the big test: Quick \t\t\tStop!  \n[83]\t\t\tYou know that girl!!  \n[84]\t\t\tYou know what this is!  This is fate.  \n[85]\t\t\tI was talking about us meeting - what \t\t\tare the chances!  \n[86]\t\t\tThe Quick Stop girl died!  \n[87]\t\t\tY.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her \t\t\ttoo!  \n[88]\t\t\tOne friend in an asylum, the other \t\t\tfriend in the grave.  You're a \t\t\tdangerous person to know.  \n[89]\t\t\tVery solid.  \n[90]\t\t\tTwo towns away from each other for \t\t\tyears and we had to meet in New York.  \tThe Sand stops playing. People clap.  \n[91]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat's rude.  \n[92]\t\t\tSorry.  It's just... new to him.  \n[93]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWould you shut up!!  \n[94]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI don't know how many times I can \t\t\tapologize for him.  \n[95]\t\t\tHere we go.  \n[96]\t\t\tAs stupid as you usually come off \t\t\tduring this diatribe of your's, you're \t\t\tgoing to come off ten times as stupid \t\t\ton this occasion.  \n[97]\t\t\tYou're such an idiot.  \n[98]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHoly shit, is that the time.  We've \t\t\tgotta beat traffic.  \n[99]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tAnd rush hour starts in six hours. \t\t\tLet's go. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThanks for inviting us out.  It was... \t\t\teducational.  \tAlyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the \tbooth.  \n[100]\t\t\tLower your voice.  \n[101]\t\t\tI'm sure the gay community appreciates \t\t\tyour support.  \tJOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.  \n[102]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI don't think it's a good idea.  \tBanky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden.  \n[103]\t\t\tThe cartoon.  \n[104]\t\t\tIs this how you want to be remembered! \t\t\tAs the guy who created Bluntman and \t\t\tChronic!  \tBanky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through \tthe guy's stuff.  \n[105]\t\t\tBut it'll be all glossy and main- \t\t\tstream.  We'll lose any artistic \t\t\tcredibility we ever had.  \n[106]\t\t\tI'll give it some thought  \n[107]\t\t\tI'm retarded!  This from the guy who \t\t\tonly forty five minutes ago paid fifty \t\t\tbucks for what's supposed to be a boot- \t\t\tleg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' \t\t\twith a deleted scene of Stan Laurel \t\t\twearing a French Tickler.  \n[108]\t\t\tTwelve episodes.  \n[109]\t\t\tBanky seems to think so.  \n[110]\t\t\tI don't know if that's the perception \t\t\tI want people to have of our stuff.  I \t\t\tknow this sounds pretentious as hell, \t\t\tbut I like to think of us as artists. \t\t\tAnd I'd like to get back to doing \t\t\tsomething more personal - like our \t\t\tfirst book.  \n[111]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tAs soon as we have something personal \t\t\tto say.  \n[112]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[113]\t\t\tUh... thanks.  \n[114]\t\t\tI didn't say anything.  \n[115]\t\t\tSure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail- \t\t\tman.  \n[116]\t\t\tHuh!  No, not really.  \n[117]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt's just that we've.., I mean, I've \t\t\tnever seen that kind of thing up close \t\t\tand personal.  It just took awhile to \t\t\tprocess, longer than usual.  \n[118]\t\t\tUm.  If you want to.  \n[119]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhy girls?  \n[120]\t\t\tBecause that's the standard  \n[121]\t\t\tIt's more than that.  \n[122]\t\t\tCurious about men?  Well... I always \t\t\twondered why my father watched 'Hee- \t\t\tHaw'.  \n[123]\t\t\tNo.  \n[124]\t\t\tNo interest.  \n[125]\t\t\tGirls feel right.  \n[126]\t\t\tWait, wait, wait - you're still a \t\t\tvirgin?  \n[127]\t\t\tBut you've only been with girls.  \n[128]\t\t\tIsn't that the standard definition?  \n[129]\t\t\tWith a member of the opposite sex.  \n[130]\t\t\tBecause that's the standard.  \n[131]\t\t\tOf course not.  \n[132]\t\t\tOkay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost \t\t\twhen the hymen is broken.  \n[133]\t\t\tSecond revision - virginity is lost \t\t\tthrough penetration.  \n[134]\t\t\tEmotional?  \n[135]\t\t\tPhysical penetration.  \n[136]\t\t\tYeah, but not real sex.  \n[137]\t\t\tWell where's the penetration in \t\t\tlesbian sex.  \tAlyssa holds up her hand.  \n[138]\t\t\tA finger?  Come on.  I've had my \t\t\tfinger in my ass but I wouldn't say \t\t\tI've had anal sex.  \n[139]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're kidding?!?! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow...?!?  \n[140]\t\t\tBut doesn't it hurt?!  \n[141]\t\t\tWhat about not-so-special occasions?  \n[142]\t\t\tBut how can that be enough?  I mean, \t\t\tlet's be real - how big can a tongue \t\t\teven get?  \tAlyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her \ttongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed. \tAlyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.  \n[143]\t\t\tJust...uh... just give me a moment.    \n[144]\t\t\tLook at you.  It's a two day trip.  \n[145]\t\t\tWe're going to a convention, for the \t\t\tlove of God.  We'll be busy from ten \t\t\t'till eight each day. \t\t\tWhen are you possibly going to have \t\t\ttime for any of that shit?  In fact, \t\t\tfuck it - you're leaving some of this \t\t\tshit here in a locker.  Come on - give \t\t\tme the two that aren't clothes.  \n[146]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[147]\t\t\tWho are you, Larry fucking Flynt? \t\t\tWhat are you going to do with all of \t\t\tthose?  \n[148]\t\t\tYou've got like thirty books there! \t\t\tWe're only there for two days!  \n[149]\t\t\tGo check us in.  I've gotta call \t\t\tAlyssa.  \n[150]\t\t\tPut that stuff away.  \tHolden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A \tlittle KID enters, staring at him.  \n[151]\t\t\tWhat's up?  I'm about to get on a \t\t\tplane.  \n[152]\t\t\tLast minute invite to the Dragon Con'.  \n[153]\t\t\tWhat?  \n[154]\t\t\tThe one that wrote the book?  \n[155]\t\t\tYou didn't get invited to the Con'?  \n[156]\t\t\tWell this sucks. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou know - both of us don't have to \t\t\tgo.  \n[157]\t\t\tYeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's \t\t\tnot like we're on a panel.  It was \t\t\tjust a signing appearance.  \n[158]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhere's your apartment?  \n[159]\t\t\tI'll be there in half an hour.  \n[160]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[161]\t\t\tListen to me - I'm not going.  You're \t\t\tgoing to have to do this one by \t\t\tyourself.  \n[162]\t\t\tAlyssa's coming down for the weekend, \t\t\tso I want to hang out with her.  You \t\t\tdon't need me for this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tMeantime,  I'll take this stuff home. \t\t\tYou can keep the filth.  I'll pick you \t\t\tup at nine Sunday night, alright? \t\t\tDon't forget to plug the Annual and \t\t\tdon't mention the t.v. show, okay? \t\t\tCall me if you get bored.  \tAnd he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A \tcheck-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag \treads 'Frank'.  \n[163]\t\t\tExcuse me?  \n[164]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm Holden, by the way.  \n[165]\t\t\tLook, we're just friends.  \n[166]\t\t\tAnd how do you know men so well?  \n[167]\t\t\tWho was that?  \n[168]\t\t\tWhy would you want to hang our with \t\t\tsomeone bitter as that?  \n[169]\t\t\tYeah.  You?  \n[170]\t\t\tReally?  Did you have a strict \t\t\tupbringing?  \n[171]\t\t\tYou think your upbringing had \t\t\tsomething to do with your lifestyle \t\t\tchoice?  \n[172]\t\t\tShoes?  \n[173]\t\t\tLet me ask you something - we get \t\t\talong, right?  \n[174]\t\t\tWe have a definite chemistry?  \n[175]\t\t\tBut we're both into girls.  \n[176]\t\t\tBut you weren't always gay.  \n[177]\t\t\tSo If we'd met a long time ago, say in \t\t\thigh school...  \n[178]\t\t\tThought so.    \n[179]\t\t\tCome in.  \tAlyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their \tgame.  \n[180]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'll be ready in a second. \t\t\tI just have to school this mouthy \t\t\tsecond-stringer.  \n[181]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat?  Do something!  \n[182]\t\t\tLook at how slow you are.  Christ, you \t\t\tmove like a geriatric.  \n[183]\t\t\tOh. It's the controller, right?  It's \t\t\talways the controller.  \n[184]\t\t\tFinal sixty of the third.  \n[185]\t\t\tImagine if I'd only beaten him by one \t\t\tinstead of thirty.    \n[186]\t\t\tHow could you have grown up down the \t\t\tshore and never played skee-ball? \t\t\tWhat did you do with your youth?  \tThey head toward the skee-ball runs.  \n[187]\t\t\tNot your grade school years; your high \t\t\tschool years.  \n[188]\t\t\t\t(Inserts coin and pulls \t\t\t\tlever \t\t\tThe premise is very basic - you roll \t\t\tthe ball up the ramp at varying \t\t\tspeeds, in an effort to pop it into \t\t\tthe score circles.  The higher the \t\t\tscore, the more prize tickets you get.  \n[189]\t\t\tTrade them in for prizes that aren't \t\t\tworth nearly as much as you paid to \t\t\tplay the game.  \n[190]\t\t\tIt's fun.  \n[191]\t\t\tObserve.  \tHolden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point \tcircle.  \n[192]\t\t\tSee?  It's just that simple.  \n[193]\t\t\tWhere's the skill in that?  \n[194]\t\t\tJust toss one.  \tAlyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it \toverhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back \tat them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an \t\"OW!\" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.  \n[195]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.  \tHolden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head. \tHe gets up.  \n[196]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThank you. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tUnderhand.  Throw it underhand.  \n[197]\t\t\tIt's like Spanish Fly.  This'll \t\t\tprobably be the first time I don't \t\t\tscore afterwards.  \n[198]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo what'd you do last night? \t\t\t\t  \n[199]\t\t\tMaybe we should just leave before \t\t\tsomebody gets hurt.  \n[200]\t\t\tHe just feels left out, I think.  \n[201]\t\t\tI thought he was talking to you.  \n[202]\t\t\tHe was just pissed he was losing.  \n[203]\t\t\tC'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.  \n[204]\t\t\tIt says he gets too easily frustrated.  \n[205]\t\t\tHow do you figure?  \n[206]\t\t\tI think you're reading too much into \t\t\tit.  \n[207]\t\t\tYou're blowing this way out of \t\t\tproportion.  We live in a more \t\t\ttolerant age now.  You refer to \t\t\tyourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls \t\t\thimself a faggot all the time...  \n[208]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow bad do you suck!  \n[209]\t\t\tLeave it alone.  \n[210]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tAww.  Everyone bugs you.  \n[211]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou know, you should watch that.  If \t\t\tyou're going to get all bent out of \t\t\tshape while playing the game, so much \t\t\tso that you need to curse the t.v., \t\t\ttry not to gay-bash it, alright. \t\t\tYou're nor that kind of guy. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tAnd don't call her a dyke, alright? \t\t\tShe's a lesbian.  \tHolden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat. \tBanky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down \tand crosses to the drawing table.  \n[212]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm starting a new page.  \n[213]\t\t\tWe're friends.  \n[214]\t\t\tI beg your pardon?  Programming?  \n[215]\t\t\tIt's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; \t\t\tand I know you're not really \t\t\tprejudiced at heart.  You should just \t\t\tfind some other way to express your \t\t\tanger, is all I'm saying.  \tHolden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he \tgrabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to \tthe side.  He starts drawing something.  \n[216]\t\t\tWhat the fuck are you doing!  \n[217]\t\t\tWhat is this supposed to prove?  \n[218]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThe man-hating dyke.  \n[219]\t\t\tI don't know.  \n[220]\t\t\tI don't need this.  I'm going home.  \n[221]\t\t\tAnd why would she need to do that? \t\t\tWhat is she Mata fucking Hari?!  What \t\t\tdoes she gain?  \n[222]\t\t\tYou're so out of line right now..,  \n[223]\t\t\tWatch your fucking mouth, is all I'm \t\t\tgoing to tell you..  \n[224]\t\t\tSometimes your paranoia and suspicious \t\t\tbullshit is amusing.  Sometimes it's \t\t\tjust fucking annoying as piss!  \n[225]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI think you should let this one go.  \n[226]\t\t\tLet it go...  \n[227]\t\t\tI'm in love with her, man.  \tBanky stares at him.  Holden stares back.  Banky looks \tinto Holden's eyes.  Suddenly, he softens a bit.  He \tdrops his head.  \n[228]\t\t\tI wish you were the one being pursued \t\t\tby M-TV.  \n[229]\t\t\tSure.  Then you could sell our and \t\t\tmaybe pick up the check once in \t\t\tawhile.  \n[230]\t\t\tWell it's not like this is a bed and \t\t\tbreakfast,  \n[231]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tTell me you're kidding!  \n[232]\t\t\tI've always wondered what kind of \t\t\tpeople buy those things.  I can't \t\t\tbelieve you talked him down to twenty \t\t\tfive!  \n[233]\t\t\tWhere are you going to hang it?  \n[234]\t\t\tYou want me to hang it for you?  You \t\t\tbetter hope it doesn't get out to the \t\t\tgirl-nation that you needed a man to \t\t\thelp you hang a picture.  \n[235]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYeah, right.  \n[236]\t\t\tWhy?  \n[237]\t\t\tBecause I can't take it.  \n[238]\t\t\tI love you.  \n[239]\t\t\tI love you.  And not in a friendly \t\t\tway, although I think we're great \t\t\tfriends.  And not in a misplaced \t\t\taffection, puppy-dog way, although I'm \t\t\tsure that's what you'll call it.  And \t\t\tit's not because you're unattainable. \t\t\tI love you.  Very simple, very truly. \t\t\tYou're the epitome of every attribute \t\t\tand quality I've ever looked for in \t\t\tanother person.  I know you think of \t\t\tme as just a friend and crossing that \t\t\tline is the furthest thing from an \t\t\toption you'd ever consider.  But I \t\t\tcan't do this any longer.  I can't \t\t\tstand next to you without wanting to \t\t\thold you.  I can't look into your eyes \t\t\twithout feeling that longing you only \t\t\tread about in trashy romance novels. \t\t\tI can't talk to you without wanting to \t\t\texpress my love for everything you \t\t\tare.  I know this will probably queer \t\t\tour friendship - no pun intended - but \t\t\tI had to say it, because I've never \t\t\tfelt this before, and I like who I am \t\t\tbecause of it.  And if bringing it to \t\t\tlight means we can't hang out anymore, \t\t\tthen that hurts me.  But I couldn't \t\t\tallow another \tday to go by without \t\t\tgetting it out there, regardless of \t\t\tthe outcome, which by the look on your \t\t\tface is to be the inevitable shoot- \t\t\tdown.  And I'll accept that But I know \t\t\tsome part of you is hesitating for a \t\t\tmoment, and if there is a moment of \t\t\thesitation, that means you feel \t\t\tsomething too.  All I ask is that you \t\t\tnot suppress that - at least for ten \t\t\tminutes - and try to dwell in it \t\t\tbefore you dismiss it. \t\t\tThere isn't another soul on this \t\t\tfucking planet who's ever made me the \t\t\tperson I am when I'm with you, and I \t\t\twould risk this friendship for the \t\t\tchance to take it to the next plateau. \t\t\tBecause it's there between you and me. \t\t\tYou can't deny that.  And even if we \t\t\tnever speak again after tonight, \t\t\tplease know that I'm forever changed \t\t\tbecause of you and what you've meant \t\t\tto me, which - while I do appreciate \t\t\tit - I'd never need a painting of \t\t\tbirds bought at a diner to remind me \t\t\tof.  \tHolden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets \tout of the car.  \n[240]\t\t\tWas it something I said?    \n[241]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[242]\t\t\tYou're going to hitch to New York?  \n[243]\t\t\tAren't you at least going to comment?  \n[244]\t\t\tWhy?  \n[245]\t\t\tIt's unfair that I'm in love with you?  \n[246]\t\t\tSo?  People change.  \n[247]\t\t\tBut that's every relationship! \t\t\tThere's always going to be a period of \t\t\tadjustment.  \n[248]\n[249]\t\t\tIf this is a crush... then I don't \t\t\tknow if I could take the real thing if \t\t\tit ever happens.  \tShe looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes \ther head ruefully.  \n[250]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tStay here. \t\t\t\t    \n[251]\t\t\tYou looked weirded out back there.  \n[252]\t\t\tSorry.  \n[253]\t\t\tShe had boxers on.  \tBanky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the \tOC girls.  \n[254]\t\t\tYou don't know that.  \n[255]\t\t\tBut we have read about them.  So we're \t\t\tprepared.  \n[256]\t\t\tMaybe it is for her as well.  \n[257]\t\t\tEveryone's not out to get someone in \t\t\tlife.  Bank.  \n[258]\t\t\tYourself?  \n[259]\t\t\tTo what end?  \n[260]\t\t\tShe's not going to ruin the comic.  \n[261] \tHolden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight \tbathing them.  She smokes.  \n[262]\t\t\tCan I ask you something?  \n[263]\t\t\tWhy me - you know?  Why now?  \n[264]\t\t\tYou know what I'm talking about.  \n[265]\t\t\tI'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.  \n[266]\t\t\tThen why this?  \n[267]\t\t\tStill am.  \n[268]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tShit.  \n[269]\t\t\tWell, you took the luster our of it.  \n[270]\t\t\t\t(joking - in case you didn't \t\t\t\tget it \t\t\tOf how I brought you back from the \t\t\tother side.  How all you needed was \t\t\tthe right man to turn you around.  \n[271]\t\t\tCan I at least cell people that all \t\t\tyou needed was some serious deep- \t\t\tdicking?  \tShe hits him with her pillow.    \n[272]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo?  \n[273]\t\t\t'Finger Cuffs'.  \n[274]\t\t\tAnd... she had a weird nick-name. \t\t\tWhat's your point?  \n[275]\t\t\tI suppose you do.  \n[276]\t\t\tYeah.  \n[277]\t\t\tHe's full of shit.  \n[278]\t\t\tShe's never even been with a guy.  \n[279]\t\t\tHe's pulling your chain.  And the fact \t\t\tthat you even bought it for a second \t\t\tmakes you look like an idiot.  \n[280]\t\t\tI give a shit what people think.  \n[281]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're such a fucking asshole.  \n[282]\t\t\tWould you let this go?  I'm telling \t\t\tyou - she's never even been with a \t\t\tguy, let alone those two zeroes.  \n[283]\t\t\tGive it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm \t\t\ttired of this shit!  She's my goddamn \t\t\tgirlfriend, do you understand?!  Show \t\t\ther a little fucking respect! \t\t\tAnd if you ever even so much as \t\t\tmention that Alyssa looks a little \t\t\tpeaked from now on, I'll put your \t\t\tfucking teeth down your throat!  \tHe releases Banky.  Banky brushes himself off.  \n[284]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNot bloody Likely.  \tBanky runs to the open door.  \n[285]\t\t\tSulking.  He's having a real problem \t\t\twith this Alyssa thing.  \n[286]\t\t\tBanky does not hate gays, you know \t\t\tthat.  \n[287]\t\t\tYou make it sound like me and him were \t\t\tdating.  \n[288]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHe's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.  \n[289]\t\t\tHe heard some bullshit story that she \t\t\ttook on two guys.  \n[290]\t\t\tHave it. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tActually, it's kind of gotten to me.  \n[291]\t\t\tBanky's not known for believing \t\t\tmisinformation.  He's got a pretty \t\t\tgood bullshit detector.  \n[292]\t\t\tSex with multiple partners?  \tHooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.  \n[293]\t\t\tAt the same time.  \tAgain, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.  \n[294]\t\t\tThanks for being so comforting.  \n[295]\t\t\tWell that's the thing, isn't it?  I \t\t\tshouldn't.. but it gets to me.  \n[296]\t\t\tYou see - that doesn't bother me.  But \t\t\tthe thought of her and guys... Uh!  \n[297]\t\t\tWhich is?  \n[298]\t\t\tDo I detect a little inter-subculture \t\t\tcattiness?  \n[299]\t\t\tI thought fags were all supposed to be \t\t\tsuper-supportive of one another.  \n[300]\t\t\tThree strikes.  \n[301]\t\t\tWhat do you mean?  \n[302]\t\t\tI can accept that.  \n[303]\t\t\tWhat do you mean, 'visitors'?  \n[304]\t\t\tSo that was until recently!  \n[305]\t\t\tSo nobody bur me has stayed the night \t\t\tat your place since we got together?  \n[306]\t\t\tNo, I was just wondering,  \n[307]\t\t\tLook, I was just asking.  \n[308]\t\t\tThat'd make Banky half right.  \n[309]\t\t\tHe said all the girls from North were \t\t\tbitches and sluts.  \n[310]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow about your yearbook.  \tON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player \twith the puck.  \tAlyssa jumps to her feet.  \n[311]\t\t\tWhat's with 'Finger Cuffs'?  \n[312]\t\t\tYeah.  In your senior yearbook your \t\t\tnickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is \t\t\tthat?  \n[313]\t\t\tDo you know Rick Derris?  \tON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where \tPlayer One checks Player Two into the boards, hard. \tPlayer Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his \tgloves.  \tThe crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.  \n[314]\t\t\tDid you go out with him or something?  \n[315]\t\t\tJust... you and him?  \n[316]\t\t\tCohee?  \n[317]\t\t\tRick pulled his dick out?  Really? \t\t\tWhat'd you do?  \n[318]\t\t\tExcuse me!?!  \n[319]\t\t\tSo it's true?!  \n[320]\t\t\tHow the hell could you do those \t\t\tthings?!  \n[321]\t\t\tHow am I supposed to feel about all of \t\t\tthis?  \n[322]\t\t\tI don't know how I feel about you now.  \n[323]\t\t\tSome sex?  \n[324]\t\t\tThere's a world of fucking difference \t\t\tbetween typical high school sex and \t\t\ttwo guys at once!  They fucking used \t\t\tyou?  \n[325]\t\t\tI want us to be something that we \t\t\tcan't.  \n[326]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tA normal couple.  \tHolden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then \tstarts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally \tslumping to the ground.  She cries.    \n[327]\t\t\tWhat took you so long?  \n[328]\t\t\tHow'd a dirt merchant like you ever \t\t\tlearn about likeness rights?  \n[329]\t\t\tI'll pass.  Take a look at the issue.  \tSilent Bob thumbs through the comic.  Jay looks over his \tshoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.  \n[330]\t\t\tI'll see what I can do.  \tA WAITRESS joins them.  \n[331]\t\t\tNothing, thanks.  \n[332]\t\t\tWhen is he not?  No - I'm just having \t\t\tsome girl trouble.  \n[333]\t\t\tNo.  I'm just at a point where I don't \t\t\tknow what to do.  \n[334]\t\t\tCan't do it, g.  I'm in love.  \n[335]\t\t\tJust what I needed - advice from the \t\t\t'hood  \n[336]\t\t\tI don't think you know her.  \n[337]\t\t\tYou sound like Barbra Streisand.  \n[338]\t\t\tI'm telling you, you don't know her.  \n[339]\t\t\tAlyssa Jones.  \n[340]\t\t\tShe is.  Or was.  I don't know.  \tThe Waitress returns with the order.  \n[341]\t\t\tIt's not like that.  \n[342]\t\t\tRight now? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI don't know.  I love her.  But she \t\t\thas a past  \n[343]\t\t\tEat your fucking bagel already!  \n[344]\t\t\tThe problem is shit like that.  It was \t\t\tone thing when it was just girls - \t\t\tthat was weird enough.  But now you \t\t\tthrow guys into the mix - two guys at \t\t\tonce, no less.  All that \t\t\texperience...What am I supposed to \t\t\tthink?  \n[345]\t\t\tSettling.  That's comforting, Jay. \t\t\tThanks.  \n[346]\t\t\tI'm lust having a problem with all of \t\t\tit I can't get it out of my head these \t\t\tvisuals of her doing all this shit. \t\t\tAnd I don't know why I can't let it \t\t\tgo.  Because I'm crazy about her, you \t\t\tknow?  I look at this girl, I see the \t\t\tfuture.  I see kids.  I see grand- \t\t\tkids.  \n[347]\t\t\tI'm scaring myself.  Because I think \t\t\tso much of her,  and then I can't get \t\t\tover shit like 'Finger Cuffs'. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI don't know what I'm doing.  \tHolden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his \tjoint.  There's silence. Then...  \n[348]\t\t\tWhat..what did you say?  \n[349]\t\t\tWhat's there?  \n[350]\t\t\tI don't know.  I don't know if the \t\t\tbook's going to be around much longer.  \n[351]\t\t\tAre you kidding me?  There's millions \t\t\tof people out there that'd love to see \t\t\tthemselves in a comic book.  \n[352]\t\t\tSnootchie-bootchies.  \n[353]\t\t\tI'll try.  \n[354]\t\t\tI know you're wondering why I asked \t\t\tyou both here tonight, at the same \t\t\ttime, knowing that we have shit to \t\t\tsettle between us, separately.  \n[355]\t\t\tEnough! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI've been going through things, over \t\t\tand over.  And I dissected it all, and \t\t\tlooked at it a thousand different \t\t\tways.  Banky - there's friction \t\t\tbetween us for the first time in our \t\t\tlives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and \t\t\tyou want me to sign off on this M-TV \t\t\tthing.  \n[356]\t\t\tAlyssa - you and I hit a wall, because \t\t\tI don't know how to deal with... your \t\t\tpast, I guess.  \n[357]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm only going to say it once: shut \t\t\tup. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tNow - I know I'm to blame one way or \t\t\tthe other on both accounts.  With you, \t\t\tAlyssa - it's my fault because I feel \t\t\tinadequate.  Because you've had so \t\t\tmuch experience, had such a big life; \t\t\tand my life's been pretty small in \t\t\tcomparison.  \n[358]\t\t\tPlease.  I have to get through this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tAnd with you Banky - I know why you're \t\t\thaving such a hard time with Alyssa, \t\t\tand it's something that's been obvious \t\t\tforever, but I guess I just didn't \t\t\tacknowledge it. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're in love with me.  \n[359]\t\t\tYou're attracted to me.  Just as, in a \t\t\tway, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it \t\t\tmakes sense - we've been together so \t\t\tlong, we have so much in common...  \n[360]\t\t\tIt's something you're going to have to \t\t\tdeal with.  Bank.  You may very well \t\t\tbe gay, which explains your homophobia \t\t\tand why you're so jealous of Alyssa, \t\t\tand your sense of humor as well.  \n[361]\t\t\tBank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll \t\t\tfeel much better.  \tHe grabs a chair from the side of the room.  \n[362]\t\t\tNow - at this point, you may be asking \t\t\tyourself the question that I've been \t\t\tgoing over and over in my head for the \t\t\tlast few days: what does one have to \t\t\tdo with the other?  \tAlyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.  \n[363]\t\t\tAnd when I did some serious soul- \t\t\tsearching, it came at me from out of \t\t\tnowhere, and suddenly it all made \t\t\tsense - a calm came over me.  I know \t\t\twhat we have to do.  And then you - \t\t\tBank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... \t\t\tcan finally be... alright.  \n[364]\t\t\t\t(sits in the chair; takes a \t\t\t\tlong beat \t\t\tWe've all got to have sex together.  \tThe room is silent.  Holden Lights a cigarette.  Banky's \teyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops.  \n[365]\t\t\tDon't you see?  That would take care \t\t\tof everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't \t\t\tfeel inadequate or too conservative \t\t\tanymore.  I'll have done something on \t\t\tpar with all the experience you've \t\t\thad.  And it'll be with you, which'll \t\t\tmake it that much more powerful.  And \t\t\tBanky - you can cake that leap that \t\t\teveryone else but you sees that you \t\t\tshould take.  And it'll be okay, \t\t\tbecause it'll be with me - your best \t\t\tfriend for years.  We've been \t\t\teverything to each other but \t\t\tintimates.  And now, we'll have been \t\t\tthrough that together too.  And it \t\t\twon't have to be a total leap for you, \t\t\tbecause a woman will be involved.  And \t\t\twhen it's over, all that aggression \t\t\tyou feel toward Alyssa will be gone. \t\t\tBecause you'll have shared in \t\t\tsomething beautiful with the woman I \t\t\tlove.  It'll be cathartic.  A true \t\t\tcommunion.  We have to do this.  For \t\t\tme, for both of you... for all of our \t\t\tsakes.  This will keep us together. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat do you say?  \tBanky stares forward, wide-eyed.  He leans back into the \tcouch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs.  \n[366]\t\t\tYou know I need this.  You know it'll \t\t\thelp.  \tAlyssa looks at him, sadly.  \n[367]\t\t\tNo?  I... I thought you'd be into \t\t\tthis.  \n[368]\t\t\tBut you've... you've done... stuff... \t\t\tlike this.  This should be no big deal \t\t\tfor you.  \n[369]\t\t\tI need this.  This has to happen.  Why \t\t\tcan't you see that?  And how can you \t\t\tnot?  What does that say about me? \t\t\tYou can take it from two guys whose \t\t\tnames you can barely remember, but I \t\t\task you to share an experience like it \t\t\t- where it's about intimacy - and you \t\t\tsay no?  \n[370]\t\t\tYou can.  I'll be there.  And when \t\t\tit's over, we'll be the strongest \t\t\twe've ever been because we got through \t\t\tsome nasty shit together.  And we'll \t\t\tfinally be on the same level together. \t\t\tAnd then there'll be nothing we can't \t\t\taccomplish.  \tA tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and \ttouches his face.  \n[371]\t\t\tNo it won't.  I thought about all of \t\t\tthat.  \n[372]\t\t\tIt's mine.  \tAlyssa looks up sharply.  \tHolden stands before her, smiling.  \n[373]\t\t\tI saved you one.  \n[374]\t\t\tHi.  \n[375]\t\t\tGood.  Really good.  Yourself?  \n[376]\t\t\tBecause it's so good.  I really liked \t\t\tit.  \n[377]\t\t\tA month ago.  I did a really small \t\t\trun.  Self-financed.  Only about five \t\t\thundred issues.  \n[378]\t\t\tYou might.  It's familiar subject \t\t\tmatter.  \tAlyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.  \n[379]\t\t\tI finally had something personal to \t\t\tsay.  \tThey look at each other for a beat  \n[380]\t\t\tI'm going to go.  I don't want to hold \t\t\tup the line.  \n[381]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tRead that, when you have a minute  \n[382]\t\t\tI'd like to hear your thoughts about \t\t\tit.  If you get a chance, give me a \t\t\tcall.  \n[383]\t\t\tNice seeing you again,  ", "McNeil": "", "Banky": "\n[1]\t\t\tFelt Like this fucking day would never \t\t\tcome.  Issue two - on the shelf.  \n[2]\t\t\tDon't start, alright!  This is a cool \t\t\tmoment, and I'd appreciate you not \t\t\ttrying to ruin it.

We got the rest of \t\t\tour lives to be artists.  But it's \t\t\tsupply and demand.  And right now,\t\t \t\t\tthe unwashed masses demand this. \n[4]\t\t\tI'll tell you who we're better than: \t\t\tthese two fags right here. \tThey approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store \tmanager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game. \n[5]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tAlright Old-Maid's - take a break from \t\t\tthe Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up. \n[6]\t\t\tYou guys operate the smallest, ladies' \t\t\tbridge circle I've ever seen. \n[7]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI don't think they're fans. \n[8]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI ink it and I'm also the colorist. \t\t\tThe guy next to me draws it.  But we \t\t\tboth came up with the characters, \n[9]\t\t\tWell.  It means that Holden draws the \t\t\tpictures in pencil, and then he gives \t\t\tit to me to go over in ink \n[10]\t\t\tIt's not tracing.  I add depth and \t\t\tshading to give the image mere \t\t\tdefinition. Only then does the drawing\t \t\t\treally take shape. \n[11]\t\t\t\t(hands book back to \t\t\t\tCollector \t\t\tNot really. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tNext! \tA LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers. \n[12]\t\t\tIt's not tracing. \n[13]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDo you want Lour book signed or what? \n[14]\t\t\tI'm secure with what I do. \n[15]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow should I sign this? \n[16]\t\t\t\t \n[17]\t\t\t\t \n[18]\t\t\tHe started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! \t\t\tHe's lucky I didn't put my pen through \t\t\this thorax! \n[19]\t\t\tWhat's a Nubian? \n[20]\t\t\tIntergalactic Civil War! \n[21]\t\t\tWell isn't that true! \tHooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his \tbelt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling \tforward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to \tscatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists \tin the air. \n[22]\t\t\tWell what about you!  You didn't tell \t\t\tme you were going to scream \u0011Black \t\t\tRage'.  I nearly pissed myself. \n[23]\t\t\tWrong coast. \n[24]\t\t\tFaggot. \n[25]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHey, hey!  I'll play your victim, but \t\t\tnot your catcher. \n[26]\t\t\tI've read your book.  It's cute. \t\t\tChick stuff, but cute. \tHolden hits him. \n[27]\t\t\tWhat? \n[28]\t\t\tWe're gonna take off soon... \n[29]\t\t\tWe'll go. \n[30]\t\t\tArchie, alright!  Archie and the \t\t\tRiverdale gang were a pure and fun- \t\t\tlovin' bunch.  You can't find \t\t\tdysfunction in those comics, because \t\t\tthey were just flat out wholesome. \n[31]\t\t\tShut the fuck up. \n[32]\t\t\tMan, I feel a hate-crime coming on \n[33]\t\t\tBecause he wanted them both at the \t\t\tsame time, you assholes!  He never \t\t\tchose one because he was trying to get \t\t\tboth of them into a three-way! \n[34]\t\t\tEat it.  Urkel. \n[35]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat's it.  You. \n[36]\t\t\tYou are marching back across the \t\t\tstreet with me, and we're going to \t\t\tpick up a shit load of Archie books, I \t\t\tam going to prove to you - beyond the \t\t\tshadow of a doubt that Archie was all \t\t\tabout pussy.  Come on. \n[37]\t\t\tYou're insane.  Archie is not fucking \t\t\tMister Weatherbee!  \n[38]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHe's just offering to help Archie with \t\t\this homework!  \n[39]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tFuck this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tLet's go.  Traffic. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHolden!  \n[40]\t\t\tLet's go.  \n[41]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat the...!  Son of a bitch!  \tBanky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.  \n[42]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThis is one of the best street lights \t\t\tyou've ever drawn.  \n[43]\t\t\tLooks just like it.  \n[44]\t\t\tGet a pizza.  Watch 'Degrassi Junior \t\t\tHigh'.  \n[45]\t\t\tI've got a weird thing for girls who \t\t\tsay 'aboot'.  \tThe phone starts ringing.  Holden answers it, while still \tdrawing.  \n[46]\t\t\tWho was that?  \n[47]\t\t\tWhen's that faggot going to learn - \t\t\tyou like chicks.  \n[48]\t\t\tSo when we leaving?  \n[49]\t\t\tAnd?  \n[50]\t\t\tLike I care about your shit.  Maybe \t\t\tI'll hook up myself.  \n[51]\t\t\tHow does one man get to be so funny!  \n[52]\t\t\tLike that'll happen.  \n[53]\t\t\tOh, you had a moment!  \n[54]\t\t\tAlright - bring on the free hootch.  \n[55]\t\t\tHey, I befriended a guy in a position \t\t\tof authority so I could abuse that \t\t\tauthority and get free shit.  You want \t\t\tto do the same?  There's a lonely \t\t\tHindu works at the'7-ll' across the \t\t\tstreet.  Get in tight with him.  \tThe Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the \tbar.  \n[56]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWanna be friends!  \n[57]\t\t\tTaking a piss.  Guy's got a bladder \t\t\tlike an infant.  \n[58]\t\t\tMust his mother tell him everything!  \tHolden enters.  \n[59]\t\t\tWhat'd you do - fall in love?  \n[60]\t\t\tShe ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say \t\t\tthat.  \tHolden smacks Banky and moves to exit.  \n[61]\t\t\tThere're a lot of chicks in this \t\t\tplace.  \n[62]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHe didn't really say that about my \t\t\tdick, did he!  \tON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and \tdances up to Alyssa.  He intentionally bumps into her.  \n[63]\t\t\tThis is so queer. \t\t\t\t  \n[64]\t\t\tNow that, my friend, is a.. \t\t\t\t(brings his fingers together, \t\t\t\tmimicing Holden \t\t\t...shared moment  \tHolden continues to stare - mouth agape.  \tAlyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.    \n[65]\t\t\tWhat?!  \n[66]\t\t\tMan, when are we ever going to get a \t\t\tchance to see this kind of shit live \t\t\twithout paying for it?  \tAlyssa and the Girl break their kiss.  \n[67]\t\t\tOh, and you're an old hand at this.  \n[68]\t\t\tYou said 'fuck'.  To that girl.  You \t\t\tsaid you'd 'fuck' her.  \n[69]\t\t\tHow can a girl 'fuck' another girl! \t\t\tWere you talking about strap-ons or \t\t\tsomething?  \n[70]\t\t\tWhat!!?  It's a valid question.  You \t\t\tknow the dyke stuff in the Penthouse \t\t\tLetters section is written by guys - \t\t\tthis is our chance to get the inside \t\t\tscoop.  \n[71]\t\t\tThen what's with saying 'fuck? \t\t\tShouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at \t\t\tleast modify the term 'fuck' with \t\t\tsomething like 'fist'?  \n[72]\t\t\tAsk Hooper.  \n[73]\t\t\tSure.  \n[74]\t\t\tHey - I always notice the bored look \t\t\tin their eyes.  \n[75]\t\t\tSome of them I downright loathe.  \n[76]\t\t\tI don't do that.  \n[77]\t\t\tI stopped dropping.  It got to be too \t\t\tfrustrating.  \n[78]\t\t\tWhat?!  I lost my tolerance for the \t\t\tbullshit baggage that comes with \t\t\teating girls out.  What's the big \t\t\tdeal?!  \n[79]\t\t\tNot the smell - the smell is good. \t\t\tI'm talking about not being able to do \t\t\tit property.  And my mother brought me \t\t\tup to believe that if I can't do \t\t\tsomething \t\t\tright I shouldn't do it at all.  Of \t\t\tcourse, my father told me she gave \t\t\tlousy head, but that's beside the \t\t\tpoint.  \n[80]\t\t\tNo, I blame them.  Chicks never help \t\t\tyou out.  They never tell you what to \t\t\tdo.  And most of them are self- \t\t\tconscious about that smell factor, and \t\t\tso most of the time they just lay \t\t\tthere, frozen like a deer in the \t\t\theadlights, right?  Not for nothing, \t\t\tbut when a chick goes down on me.  I \t\t\tlet her know where to go, and what the \t\t\tstatus is.  You gotta handle it like \t\t\tCNN and the Weather Channel - constant \t\t\tupdates.  \n[81]\t\t\tAnd that's all I'm saying, it'd be \t\t\tdifferent if chicks helped out - \t\t\tpointed a guy in the right direction. \t\t\tThen there'd be no bullshit, no wasted \t\t\ttime, and no chance for permanent \t\t\tinjuries.  \n[82]\t\t\tSure.  You wanna see something \t\t\tpermanent! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI got this from Nina Rollins, \t\t\tsophomore year.  I'm going down on \t\t\ther, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps \t\t\ton her stomach.  She does this big ol' \t\t\tpelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in \t\t\thalf, sends it down my throat.  I had \t\t\tto get a crown for the stub.  \n[83]\t\t\tYou see this! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat's the farthest I can move my neck \t\t\tto the right Sophomore year, I'm going \t\t\tout with Maria Bennert, and for six \t\t\tmonths, I'm going down on her, and not \t\t\ta damn thing's happening. \t\t\tThen one night, I change a position, \t\t\tor vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly \t\t\tit's a whole new world.  She's moving \t\t\taround, convulsing, breathing heavy. \t\t\tAnd her legs are pressing against my \t\t\tears so tightly that I don't hear her \t\t\tfather come into the room.  He grabs \t\t\tmy hair... \t\t\t\t(grabs his own hair and pulls \t\t\t\tback \t\t\t...and he pulls me way back, hard.  \n[84]\t\t\tWhat traffic - it's one thirty in the \t\t\tmorning!  \n[85]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSince you like chicks, right.. \t\t\tdo you just look at yourself in the \t\t\tmirror all the time?  \tHolden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches \tthem go, then turns and kisses Kim.    \n[86]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou're still dwelling on the dyke, \t\t\taren't you?  \n[87]\t\t\tWhat'd I tell you - she just needs the \t\t\tright guy.  All every woman really \t\t\twants - be it mother, senator, nun - \t\t\tis some serious deep-dicking.  \tThe Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, \tshocked.  \n[88]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDon't give me that look - I heard Adam \t\t\tCurry say worse.  \tThe Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at \tHolden.  \n[89]\t\t\tThat's why I can't buy lesbians. \t\t\tEveryone needs dick.  See, I can buy \t\t\tfags.  Bunch of guys that need dick - \t\t\tjust plain need it?  That I get. \t\t\tDykes?  Bullshit posturing.  But - \t\t\tlive and let live, I guess.  \n[90]\t\t\tSloss like a mother fucker. \t\t\t\t  \n[91]\t\t\tEven more retarded and juvenile to \t\t\tsate the voracious, intellectually- \t\t\tchallenged miscreants that make up \t\t\tyour key demographic.  \tThe Execs laugh hard.  Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and \tgives the thumbs up.  \n[92]\t\t\tYou did better - you sold us out!  \tThey clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.  \n[93]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tMoney and Power, and Money and \t\t\tPower...  \n[94]\t\t\tWhat's not a good idea!  Please don't \t\t\tsay the cartoon, please don't say the \t\t\tcartoon...  \n[95]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tJohn, let me handle this. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou are out of your fucking mind, \t\t\taren't you!  \n[96]\t\t\tNo, I'd like to be remembered as the \t\t\tfilthy rich guy who created Bluntman \t\t\tand Chronic.  \n[97]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHe just has to get over this crush of \t\t\this.  \n[98]\t\t\t\t(opening drawer with a letter \t\t\t\topener \t\t\tNot on her; on Alyssa Jones - the \t\t\tchick that does that comic book \t\t\t'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  You ever \t\t\tseen it?  \n[99]\t\t\tShe'd never let him in her yard.  The \t\t\tchick's gay.  \n[100]\t\t\tAlways working, you. \t\t\t\t(holds up a Polaroid of a \t\t\t\tnaked woman \t\t\tLook at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a \t\t\tstring of pearls hanging our of her \t\t\tass,  \n[101]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm taking this as a precaution - just \t\t\tin case they give us any shit about \t\t\tpussy's decision delay. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou'll 'give it some thought'.  You're \t\t\tso retarded  \n[102]\t\t\tThe guy who sold it to me had an \t\t\thonest face.    \n[103]\t\t\tI got the Sega in one bag, my clothes \t\t\tin the other, and two months worth of \t\t\tunread comics in this one.  \n[104]\t\t\tHold on. \t\t\t\t(starts rifling through one \t\t\t\tbag  \n[105]\t\t\tI just have to get something. \t\t\t\t(pulls out a huge stack of \t\t\t\tporno books  \n[106]\t\t\tRead the articles.  What do you think \t\t\tI'm going to do with them?  They're \t\t\tstroke books.  \n[107]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tVariety's the spice of life.  I like a \t\t\twide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the \t\t\tmood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I \t\t\tlike them arty and air-brushed.  Some \t\t\ttimes it's a spread brown-eye kind of \t\t\tnight, sometimes it's girl-on-girl \t\t\ttime.  Sometimes a steamy letter will \t\t\tdo it, sometimes - not often, but \t\t\tsometimes - I like the idea of a chick \t\t\twith a horse.  \tA beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper.  \n[108]\t\t\tHis master's voice.  \n[109]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDo you Like horsies?  \tHolden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him \tand Alyssa at home.  \n[110]\t\t\t...And then Black Beauty couldn't take \t\t\tit any longer, and he finally did some \t\t\tof his own mounting.  \n[111]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI think I want kids of my own one day. \t\t\tThey're fun.  \n[112]\t\t\tWhat?  Why?  \n[113]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHunhh! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYeah.  But this is carry-on.  \n[114]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNot this trip.  But one time, when I \t\t\twas using curb side check-in, this sky- \t\t\tcap gave me a cock ring and a set of \t\t\tanal ben-wa balls.  I always thought \t\t\tthat was pretty strange.  He said his \t\t\tname was Frank. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHey!  You're name's Frank!  \tBanky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go.  \n[115]\t\t\tI thought you lived in the city?  This \t\t\tis like the umpteenth time I've seen \t\t\tyou here.  Isn't that grounds enough \t\t\tfor the little pink mafia to throw you \t\t\tout of their club?  \n[116]\t\t\tBitch, you're schooling no one.  \tThey play.  Cut back and forth between the game and \tBanky, Holden, and Alyssa.  \n[117]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock \t\t\tyour fucking teeth out and pass all \t\t\tover your ass.  \n[118]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tFuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man! \t\t\tThese faggots won't do what I tell \t\t\tthem to!  \n[119]\t\t\tNo, it's these... fucking queers on \t\t\tblades that can't accept a fucking \t\t\tpass to save their lives!  What period \t\t\tis this?  \n[120]\t\t\tFuck!  Look at your fucking guys, \t\t\tthey... FUCK!!! \t\t\t\t \n[121]\t\t\tHow was your pseudo-date?  \n[122]\t\t\tThat chick bugs me.  \n[123]\t\t\tGet off. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tFucking faggot!  Did you see that?! \t\t\tYour dyke courting ass just got me \t\t\tscored on!  \n[124]\t\t\tWhat the fuck is going on here?  \n[125]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNot with this shit!  With you.  What \t\t\tthe fuck is going on with you and that \t\t\tgirl?  \n[126]\t\t\tShe's programming you.  \n[127]\t\t\tYeah.  And apparently, you don't even \t\t\trealize it.  What does it matter if I \t\t\trefer to her as a dyke, or if I call \t\t\tthe Whalers a bunch of faggots in the \t\t\tprivacy of my own office, far from the \t\t\tsensitive ears of the rest of the \t\t\tworld?  \n[128]\t\t\tBear with me here.  I just want to put \t\t\tyou through this little exercise. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tOkay, now see this?  This is a four \t\t\tway road, okay?  \tBanky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to \this voice-over.  \n[129]\t\t\tAnd dead in the center, is a crisp, \t\t\tnew, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the \t\t\tend of each of the streets, are four \t\t\tpeople, okay?  You following?  Up \t\t\there, we got a male-affectionate, easy- \t\t\tto-get-along-with, no political agenda \t\t\tlesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we \t\t\thave a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, \t\t\tagenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.  To this \t\t\tside, we got Santa Claus, right?  And \t\t\tover to this side - the Easter Bunny.  \tBanky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head  \n[130]\t\t\tWhich one's going to get to the \t\t\thundred dollar bill first?  \n[131]\t\t\tI'm serious.  This is a serious \t\t\texercise.  It's like an S.A.T. \t\t\tquestion.  Which one's going to get to \t\t\tthe hundred dollar bill first - the \t\t\tmale-friendly lesbian, the man-hating \t\t\tdyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter \t\t\tBunny?  \n[132]\t\t\tGood.  Why?  \n[133]\t\t\t\t(wildly crossing out the \t\t\t\tother three \n[134]\t\t\tShe's fucking with your mind, man! \t\t\tShe knows you've got this schoolboy \t\t\tcrush and she's using it to sway your \t\t\tway of thinking!  \n[135]\t\t\tMaybe she thinks you'll get her comic \t\t\tpicked up by Contender.  Or maybe she \t\t\tthinks you'll change the content of \t\t\tour book to something more political \t\t\tand message oriented.  Or, gee - I \t\t\tdon't know - maybe because that's just \t\t\twhat dykes like to do: fuck around \t\t\twith straight guys' heads, just so she \t\t\tcan go back to her little rug-muncher \t\t\tclub and have a good laugh with all \t\t\ther man-hating harpy cronies about how \t\t\tfucking stupid and easily duped men \t\t\tare!  \n[136]\t\t\tYou don't even know this girl!  Big \t\t\tdeal, she's from Middletown and she \t\t\twent to North!  All the girls at North \t\t\twere bitches and sluts anyway!  And \t\t\tthis one's got them beat by a mile \t\t\tbecause she's a bitch/slut/dyke!  \n[137]\t\t\tOh why?  Do you get my back when she \t\t\tbashes me?  Because I know she does. \t\t\tAnd do you know why she does?  Because \t\t\tI won't play her fucking game!  \n[138]\t\t\tWhat is it about this girl?  You know \t\t\tyou have no shot at getting her into \t\t\tbed!  Why do you bother wasting time \t\t\twith her?  Because you're Holden \t\t\tfucking McNeil - most persistent \t\t\ttraveller on the road that's not the \t\t\tpath of least resistance! \t\t\tEverything's gotta be a fucking \t\t\tchallenge for you, and this little \t\t\trelationship with that bitch is a \t\t\tprime example of your fucking \t\t\tcondition.  Well I don't need a \t\t\tfucking magic eight ball to look into \t\t\tyour future; you want a forecast? \t\t\tHere - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa. \t\t\t\t(shakes and looks at \t\t\t\timaginary ball \t\t\tWhat a shock - \"Not fucking likely\"! \t\t\tThis relationship of  your's is \t\t\taffecting you, our work and our \t\t\tfriendship, and the time's going to \t\t\tcome when I throw down the gauntlet \t\t\tand say it's me or her!  And then \t\t\twhat're you going to say?!  \n[139]\t\t\tNo, what would you say?  Would you \t\t\ttrash twenty years of friendship \t\t\tbecause you've got some idiotic notion \t\t\tthat this chick would even let you \t\t\tsniff her panties, let alone fuck \t\t\ther?!  \n[140]\t\t\tWhat the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES \n[141]\t\t\tFuck.  \tBanky walks away.  Holden watches him go and exits.    \n[142]\t\t\tCatholic school girls.  \tAcross the street, the Catholic High School is letting \tout.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters \tsmoke, frolic, wait for their bus.  \n[143]\t\t\tThe uniform is what does it for me.  I \t\t\twish I'd have went with more Catholic \t\t\tschool girls when I was a kid.  As it \t\t\tstands.  I have no \"...and then she \t\t\tunzipped her jumper...\" stories.  \n[144]\t\t\tThat's my couch you were fucking on.  \n[145]\t\t\tI wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do \t\t\twhen your best friend's wrapped around \t\t\ta naked rug-muncher on your couch.  \n[146]\t\t\tThis is all going to end badly.  \n[147]\t\t\tI know you.  You're way too \t\t\tconservative for that girl.  She's \t\t\tbeen around and seen things we've only \t\t\tread about in books.  \n[148]\t\t\tThere's no 'we' here.  You're going to \t\t\thave to go through this alone.  And \t\t\tit's one thing to read about shit, and \t\t\tsomething different when you're forced \t\t\tto deal with it on a regular basis. \t\t\tWhen you guys are walking in the mall \t\t\tand both your heads turn at a really \t\t\tnice looking chick, it's going to eat \t\t\tyou up inside.  You'll spend most of \t\t\tyour time wondering when the other \t\t\tshoe's going to drop.  Because for \t\t\tyou, this isn't about cool weird sex \t\t\tstuff, it's about love.  \n[149]\t\t\tSomehow I doubt it.  \n[150]\t\t\tEverybody has an agenda.  Everyone.  \n[151]\t\t\tMy agenda is to watch your back.  \n[152]\t\t\tTo insure that all this time we've \t\t\tspent together, building something, \t\t\twasn't wasted.  \n[153]\t\t\tI wasn't talking about the comic. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm going to gel a bagel.

The world \t\t\twould be a better place if people \t\t\twould just accept that there's nothing \t\t\tnew under the sun, and everything you \t\t\tcan do with a person has probably been \t\t\tdone long before you got there.  \n[67]\t\t\tHoney, that almost sounded convincing. \t\t\tDo yourself a favor - just ask her \t\t\tabout her past, point blank.  Get it \t\t\tout of the way, before it gets too big \t\t\tfor both ya'll to move. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tOooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'!  \tHooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his \thands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely \tclad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do \tGirls - All XXX Action.'    ", "X": "\n[1] \tHolden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, \tbiting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He \tsticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks \tup another one and then repeats the whole process.  A \tReceptionist types.  \n[2] \tThe EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches \tacross from our trio.  \n[3]\t\t\tWe just want to start off by saying \t\t\tthat it's a pleasure to finally meet \t\t\tyou.  While it's been - shall we say - \t\t\tan experience dealing with Sloss here, \t\t\tone of the main reasons we started \t\t\tthis whole thing was to meet the guys \t\t\tthat do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.  \n[4]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t'Snootchie Bootchies'.  \tThe Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely \tjoin in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' \tlook.  \n[5]\t\t\tWhich brings us to our proposal: we \t\t\tare extremely interested in doing \t\t\ttwelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and \t\t\tChronic' cartoons.  The age of Beavis \t\t\tis coming to a close, and we're \t\t\tlooking for something... something...  \n[6]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo what do you say! Are we in \t\t\tbusiness!  \tBanky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful \tface.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in \tunderstanding.  \n[7]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tUh... absolutely.  We'll just..  \n[8]\t\t\tUh...wait outside  \tThe Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind \tthen.  Sloss turns to Banky.  \n[9] \tAlyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.  \n[10] \tHolden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is \tstanding in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up \tand down and smirks.  \n[11] \tThe car sits in traffic.    \n[12] \tThe car pulls to the side of the road.  The rain is a bit \theavier now.    \n[13] \tHolden gets out of the car.  It's raining pretty hard \tnow.  Alyssa's hitching up the road.  Holden reaches her.  \n[14] \tBanky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys \twith the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the \tdoor.  He picks up the mail on the floor.    \n[15] \tBanky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden \tsaunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's \tgaze.  \n[16] \tAlyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.  Holden \tcatches up to her.  We track with them our into the \tparking lot.  \n[17]\t\t\tYeah.  Bye. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tOkay.  Who's next?  \tAlyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in \tfront of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off \tsignatures in the copies of her comic.  ", "Singer": "\n[1]\t\t\tThank you.  Thanks.  \tThe SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.  \n[2]\t\t\tA long time ago, we used to have this \t\t\tbass player who took off one day to \t\t\tdraw funny books or something.  Maybe \t\t\tyou've seen her stuff - it's called \t\t\t'Idiosyncratic Routine''  \tThe crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. \tHolden pokes her.  \n[3]\t\t\tBut what a lot of people don't know is \t\t\tthat she used to harbor these \t\t\tdelusions that she could sing.  And \t\t\tshe used to subject us to these \t\t\tthroaty renditions of Debbie Gibson \t\t\ttunes and shit, insisting that we let \t\t\ther front on a few numbers.  Well, we \t\t\tdidn't and she quit.. and then she got \t\t\tfamous, the bitch. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tBut she's here tonight, and I think if \t\t\twe all begged, or maybe offered her \t\t\tsome X, she'd get up here and treat us \t\t\tto some of her vocal stylings. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat do you say, Alyssa?  \tAlyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden \tpushes her forward.  \n[4]\t\t\tShe's shy. \t\t\t\t "}}
