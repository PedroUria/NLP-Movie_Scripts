John Wick, that's right. Yeah, it has been awhile. I'd like to make a reservation for four. \n[46]Ten o'clock? Perfect. Thanks. \n[47]You, too, Charlie. \n[48]Thanks. \n[49]I got me a hobby or two. \n[50]Sorry, Charlie, but no.     I'm on my own nowadays. \n[51] \n[52]Thanks. \n[53]I make no promises on that. \n[54]See ya', Charlie. \n[55]I called ahead.

Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion. \n[64]Thank you. \n[65]       \n[66]Guest. \n[67]Thanks. \n[68]Thanks. \n[69]A table. \n[70]Yes, thank you. \n[71]Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it. \n[72]And start me up a tab. \n[73]Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate? \n[74]No.   Thank you. \n[75] \n[76]And where is Viggo? \n[77] \n[78]Please close out my tab. \n[79]Good evening. \n[80] \n[81]As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye. No... no, better yet, Genesis. \n[82]Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, even a young man for hurting me. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold. \n[83]Make your peace with God, Iosef... ...for the Devil shall see you soon. \n[84]Evenin'.    Is the doctor in? \n[85]Send him up, please. \n[86]Depends.    How good's your laundry? \n[87]No, I thought not. Send me up a beer, too, will you? \n[88]Anything cold. \n[89]  \n[90]Did she chip off? \n[91]Good to hear. \n[92]What sort of movement am I lookin' at? \n[93]And after? \n[94]Thanks, doc. \n[95]Evenin'. \n[96]Maybe not... but I know this place. \n[97]No.   Wait... \n[98]Sorry. \n[99]John Wick. \n[100]How about you? \n[101]You gotta' name? \n[102] \n[103]Please... call me, John. \n[104]Hello, Winston. \n[105]That, it has.

It meant a lot to me as well. \n[109]I'd love a martini. \n[110]Good man. \n[111]Thanks, Jimmy. \n[112]Hey, Jenny. \n[113]I'm not quite sure, but with that said... here I am. \n[114]I know. \n[115] \n[116]No, ma'am. \n[117] \n[118]    \n[119]                     \n[120] \n[121]Do you know where Viggo is? \n[122] \n[123]Just because I'm good at killin'... doesn't mean I like it all that much. Give me something. \n[124]What about it? \n[125]   \n[126]I'm thinkin' so. \n[127]Hey, Harry. \n[128] \n[129]You keen on earnin' a coin? \n[130]Do you mind babysittin' the breathin' one for, I dunno... ...the next six hours or so? \n[131] \n[132]Good night, Harry. \n[133]  \n[134]You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon. \n[135]Yes, in fact. For four. \n[136]Perfect. Oh, and... Do you cater? Excellent. I'll need a car, and... well... something a bit less trivial. \n[137]You willin' to put a bullet in my back, Marcus? \n[138]Been awhile, Marcus. \n[139]Why'd you take the job then? \n[140] \n[141] \n[142] \n[143]Good night, Marcus. \n[144]Yeah, that's about right. \n[145]No. \n[146]We tried, but... wasn't in the cards. \n[147] \n[148]Imagine what one would do if they did. \n[149]Goodbye, Viggo. \n[150]Americano, please.    And a bear claw. \n[151]Oh, and the bathroom? \n[152]Thanks. \n[153]\n[154]Not you. \n[155]Take me to Viggo's stash. \n[156]His stash. Personal Holdings.

You do. \n[12]Use that tone with me again... \n[13] \n[14] \n[15]It wasn't the \"what you did\", Iosef, which draws my ire, but \"who you did it to\". \n[16]Careful, son... that old man happens to be three years younger than I. \n[17]His name is John Wick... ...and when he was fifteen, he lied his way into the marines and headed off to Vietnam. He specialized in force-oriented reconnaissance, meaning he often crossed over into enemy territory to both collect information and -should the opportunity present itself- fuck with the enemy in whatever way that he saw fit. \n[18]John earned four hundred and seventeen confirmed kills over the course of his five tours. The majority of those were done by hand, by blade, and by small caliber... which is unheard of. \n[19]It got to him, though. Hell... How could it not?

Come hell or high water, by God... he'd get it done. \n[24]Then one day, he fell in love and left the game. The years scrolled past, age set in, and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die. Suddenly alone, with no family to speak of, John deserved to live -and die- in peace.

I envy that. Kids? \n[44]Lucky bastard. \n[45]I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it...
