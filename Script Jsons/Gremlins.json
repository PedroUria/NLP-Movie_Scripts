The little fellow's scared. He hates bright light.. Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on his face. He looks -at t em. There's blood on his\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4ingertips. Billy looks at Mogwai. The creature looks at Billy. It giggles. \n[44]  \n[45]Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf.

Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.

Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai. \n[65]I dunno, Pete... \n[66]They must only multiply with plain tap water. \n[67] Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group. \n[68]Dad...We don't know anything about these things. \n[69]Yeah, but isn't that pretty weird? I mean, if I throw water on\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney over there, we're not gonna;getjten copies. A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles. \n[70]Huh? \n[71] Oh, Christ. C'mo'i,Dad...that's ... \n[72]Don't you think we should have them checked out first? Just to make sure...     31 \n[73]Oh, hi Gary. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Gary grabs Billy by the collar and throws him against the car. \n[74]Well, you're the closest thing this town's got to a scientist... and I need some information about an animal. \n[75]That's what I'm trying to figure out. \n[76]The curtains are drawn. The lights are dim. The eight creatures are on the desk top. Giggling. Humming in falsetto. Billy enters with Roy and Pete. Roy stares at the creatures. He is shocked. Delighted.     33 \n[77]Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ...

Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled. \n[84]Why did they attack my dog? \n[85]  \n[86]Screw'science. I want them des- troyed. \n[87] Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already forgotten? Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the background.     39. \n[88]Now what do we do? \n[89]I don't think we should wait. Let's do it ourselves. \n[90]A doubtful, uncertain expression on his face.     40. \n[91]Next. \n[92] Hello, Mrs. Deagle. How are you this afternoon? \n[93](trying to stay \n[94]  \n[95] Mrs. Deagle, I...     43 \n[96]Mrs. Deagle, I... (He can't do it.

Gary smiles. Tracy is proud. \n[97]Yeah?... \n[98]Mom...stay downstairs. I'll be right home. He drops the phone and runs out of the bank. Gary exchanges a puzzled glance with Tracy. \n[99]Nervous. Sweating. Behind the wheel of his car. He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it. Outside, the sun is going down. \n[100]still driving. He tries to pass a slow truck. He hits a is spot. } \n[101]tries to start it. Nothing happens. It's stalled. \n[102]No...Not now... He tries again. No good. It's dead. Frustrated, Billy slams his fist on the steering wheel. \u00c2\u00b0 \n[103]sprints down his driveway. He arrives at the porch of his home. He opens the front door. \n[104]Mom?.. Scattered giggling echoes from inside. Billy flips on the'front hall..light.. A few tiny shadows scatter. They dash into other rooms. Afraid of the light. Billy'slowly enters. He's scared. He looks to the top of the stairs. \n[105]Mom?... More giggling. Shaking'. Nervous. Billy climbs the stairs. At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall light. Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap- ing the light. Billy spots the open attic door. He walks beneath it. He looks up into the dark attic. \n[106] Mom?... \n[107]He clutches his sword. Tight. Two creatures leap at him. He spears one in mid-air. He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood. The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg. It takes a bite from his calf. Billy cries out in pair. Mogwai stays on. Biting hard. Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace. Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go. Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp. Billy removes his steaming sword. The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead. Billy checks his leg. A small bite. He walks to the kitchen.     53. \n[108]Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff's Office?... \n[109]Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?... \n[110]  \n[111] Hello?... It hisses.     \n[112]running through the snow. Following Mogwai's footprints. \n[113]arrives in Peggy's backyard. He sees the young girl's legs kicking from the snowman's torso. Billy rushes over. He grabs Peggy's legs. A tug of war. Billy pulls Peggy out of the snowman. Peggy brushes the snow from her face. \n[114]Are you okay? \n[115]running through the backyards, following Mogwai's footprints The carolers' singing echoes in the distance.     \n[116]running to the group of carolers. They are puzzled by the.sword in his hand, his tattered, bloody appearance. But they continue singing. Billy follows the creatures' footprints behind the carolers , into the woods. Several feet away, Billy so-es Mogwai The creature is on top of,Pete's body Billy rushes, to the scene. Mogwai sees Billy. The creature gets scared and dashes off. Billy stops     \n[117]chasing the creature through the snow covered woods. \n[118]know you're here. The flashlight stops on the gymnasium light box. The box is attached to a.farwall, beside. the swimming pool. \n[119]Colme on out...you bastard... It is silent again. Billy is frightened. He walks faster, moving to the light box. Billy hears another sound. He shines the light to another area. Again. Nothing. Billy starts to tremble. He runs to the light box. gets there and quickly flips open the box. Billy drops the flashlight and sword. The creature's sharp fingernails clutch onto Billy's chest. Billy falls backward, with Mogwai holding onto him. They tumble into the swimming pool. The deep end. \n[120]watches from the doorway. \n[121]  \n[122]runs outof thegymnasium. \n[123]sits in front of the two men. A serious, helpless look covers his face. Frank leans toward Billy. \n[124]Yes... that's right... \n[125](nods, displaying the bite on his \n[126]It wasn't a dog, sir.

He moves faster, desperately hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword. \n[134]Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain. Brent's screams fade in the background. Billy looks out the side window. He sees \n[135]panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster. \n[136]finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to the driver's seat and starts the car. \n[137]drives faster. \n[138]  \n[139]steers the patrol car into the first driveway. The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He knocks. Hard. \n[140]  \n[141] You've got to keep your wind ws locked. Or better yet...boa d them up! And your lights...

Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out. \n[157]He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car. \n[158]C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door. \n[159]We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet.  Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car. \n[160].and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head. \n[161] You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight.  We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods. \n[162]I did. But nobody would listen. \n[163]That's not true. \n[164]That isn't.. \n[165]  \n[166]Yeah, and then I'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad. If we can... \n[167]They're here. A frightened Gary holds Tracy. \n[168]Do you have a place without win dows?... .A place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think. \n[169] We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of the.room... \n[170]We'll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in an\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdold rocking chair. Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair. \n[171]listening to the sounds. Frightened. \n[172]Help me with this. Gary and Billy slide the cabinet in front of the door. \n[173]That'llkeep them out.

Instead,\"she walks:over to Billy. \n[175]The horror of it all finally hits him. His eyes fill with tears. He cries. Alone. \n[176]sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound. \n[177](looking at their scared faces Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes. \n[178]Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf. \n[179]Damn. \n[180]How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away. \n[181]In this? You won't get far. \n[182]And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing. \n[183]No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms. \n[184]Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork. \n[185]sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant. Away from the grisly sights.- They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his burger and nods to Billy. \n[186]It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight. \n[187]No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there. \n[188] Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark. \n[189]No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area... \n[190]You used to work here, right? \n[191]You're coming in with me., You can show me around. \n[192]Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary. \n[193]This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right? \n[194] I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy. \n[195]Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater. \n[196]They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window. \n[197] How do we get to the boiler room?     97. \n[198]Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us.  1 If we could. just distract them... Tracy perks up. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2TRAC Y- I have an 'idea'.- They look .t her . \n[199]Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out. \n[200]We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit. \n[201]Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry.
