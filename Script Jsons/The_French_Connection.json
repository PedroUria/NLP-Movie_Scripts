The doors jerk open in the safety spasm. There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera, blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone. But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.  \n[35] Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the windows of his own car.  \n[36] A close view of CHARNIER's face.  He is smiling directly at DOYLE.  He gives him a little wave.  A view from CHARNIER's position of DOYLE chasing the train, anger and hatred and frustration storming across his face.  \n[37]It has been highly informative and a personal pleasure to see you again. \n[38]Soon, probably in the Spring. \n[39]Goodbye. \n[40] \n[41]Are you having trouble raising the half million? \n[42]It has to be by the end of this week. \n[43]It's your problem. \n[44]So nice to have seen you again. \n[45]Are you sure it is dead? \n[46]That's a relief. \n[47]You did find something for yourself, of course. \n[48]Excuse me a moment, darling. \n[49]I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends. \n[50]We must follow it. \n[51]I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup. \n[52]Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one. \n[53]There'll be someone else. \n[54]Henri... \n[55]Did you pick up the car? \n[56]Did they follow you? \n[57]Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing... \n[58]Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice. \n[59]Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you. \n[60] CLOSE-UP DOYLE.  He gives CHARNIER a little wave.  Long view of the Lincoln stopping in the middle of the bridge.  Zoom in on it as SAL hurriedly turns it around, smashing into the side of the bridge as he does.  Medium shot of the Lincoln racing back across the island. The Mercury roars past WEINSTOCK's car, heading toward the bridge.  WEINSTOCK's car coming to a stop.  Close shot of the CHEMIST and WEINSTOCK in the car, turning back to the island.  ", "Weinstock": "\n[1] In the East 80's.  SAL exits.  \n[2] Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing an ordinary business suit and both the table and the background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.  The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.  Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting opposite the CHEMIST.    SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are interested; SAL quite nervously.  The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.  He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny alcohol lamp.  He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case, fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.  He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the burnmeister tube, about three inches in.  With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.  We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the mineral oil and  The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220\u00b0 - 230\u00b0.  The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.  The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240\u00b0!  \n[3]Retail is not my end of the business. Are you telling me it's worth the half million? \n[4]Thank you, Howard.  Take what's left there with you and goodnight. \n[5]We got a test.  A deal for half a million dollars, maybe. \n[6]What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building. \n[7] \n[8]So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry. \n[9]Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies. \n[10] \n[11]He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business. \n[12]What about you, Sal?  Are you everything they say you are? ", "Alain": "", "Sal": "\n[1]What's this crap.

DOYLE frisks his own pockets for a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips, crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.    One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing the name of a girl.

Wonder why he don't bring his old lady? \n[40]Who's the greaser? \n[41]I think we oughta burn him on suspicion. \n[42]Makin' wine in the basement. He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers. \n[43]That's the third time he come here this week.  You got anything on the building? \n[44]You're kiddin' \n[45]He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago. \n[46]Whatta you know -- he's takin' his wife out for a change. \n[47] \n[48]We have reason to believe it's a front for the biggest counterfeiting operation in the country. \n[49]That's right.  They're trying to steal the formula for Hershey bars -- \n[50]   \n[51]What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea. \n[52] \n[53]Maybe he's goin' to see his brother. \n[54]Or could be another drop.  I guess he gets a free ride. \n[55]Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here! \n[56]What's my name? \n[57]What? \n[58]Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie? \n[59]Milk shake anyone? \n[60]Move ass when I tell you. \n[61]Put it on the bar. \n[62] \n[63]Everybody goes when the whistle blows. \n[64]What do you do in show business? \n[65]All right, that's enough, you're under arrest. \n[66]What about you?  Can you stand a toss? \n[67]You don't use shit? \n[68]Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I? \n[69]Cause if I do. \n[70]Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else you got. - Buddy! \n[71]How's everything? \n[72]How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk. \n[73]I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn. \n[74]\n[75]Got a wife named Angie. \n[76]What? \n[77]Who brings it? \n[78]Where do you want it? \n[79]I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass. \n[80] \n[81]Detach us.  Let us have a shot at it, at least until we see if there's anything here or not. Everybody wants Weinstock, right? So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve it. \n[82]Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing on your coffee break if I thought he was a nickel and dimer. \n[83] \n[84]This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock. You gotta let us have it. \n[85] \n[86]Two wires.  One on the store and one on his house. \n[87]We know you can do it, Walter. \n[88]Hiya, Jesus. \n[89]Whatta you got? \n[90]Where'd you get this fag shit? \n[91]Pass. \n[92]Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned. \n[93] \n[94]With a baseball bat!  One swing! Knock your fuckin' head off. \n[95]I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money. \n[96]You want some eggs. \n[97] \n[98](rattling pans, looking around \n[99]Strike out, eh? \n[100]A piece of ass wouldn't kill me. \n[101]Morning.  Sometime. \n[102]You got a pedaller's license? \n[103]You're under arrest. \n[104] Long shot of RUSSO approaching housing project group of buildings.  This is where DOYLE lives.  \n[105] RUSSO rings the bell.  No response.  He knocks.  Again nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.  \n[106] \n[107] \n[108] \n[109] The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside. There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying to push it open from the outside.  \n[110] \n[111]Gimme my pants. \n[112]You got the warrant? \n[113]What do we need those pricks for? \n[114]Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants? \n[115]You take Sal.  I'll stick with the beard if they split. \n[116]Pour it in your ear. \n[117]That guy just walked in.  What's his name? \n[118] \n[119]Little shorter than me.  Well- dressed.  About forty-five or fifty with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard. \n[120] \n[121]No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration? \n[122]Names. \n[123]Where from? \n[124]What's he do? \n[125]Yeh?  Who else? \n[126]This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping? \n[127]Where's he from? \n[128] \n[129] \n[130]Yeah, I know. \n[131]The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute. \n[132]Who's on him? \n[133]What about Sal? \n[134] \n[135] \n[136]Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week. \n[137]You own that lamppost? \n[138]Then how come you're leaning on it. \n[139]I ever bust you? \n[140]Get your ass in the car. \n[141]You gonna wait on me or am I gonna sit here all day? \n[142]Hey! \n[143] \n[144]Can you stand a toss, Hector? \n[145]You still dealin' shit? \n[146]When they going to make you chairman of the board? \n[147]You clean your fingernails with this. \n[148]Yeah, I guess so. \n[149]I'm sittin' on Frog One. \n[150] \n[151]The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake. \n[152]I don't care how many bartenders are sick.  I don't work in that joint.  What the hell kind of a union are you running down there? \n[153] Rear close view of DOYLE peeking into the forward car to see where CHARNIER is sitting.  \n[154] \n[155]I say we keep sittin' on Boca. \n[156]Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way. \n[157] \n[158]The deal hasn't gone down yet Walter -- I know it, I can feel it. \n[159] Shot of SIMONSON, MULDERIG, DOYLE, RUSSO, in a cluster.  \n[160] A complex of buildings similar to Lefrak City.  A medium close view of a LITTLE GIRL about to run DOYLE down with a two-wheel bicycle.  Two shots ring out in quick succession and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been walking a moment earlier.  DOYLE diving for the cover of a tree.  The rifle goes off a third time and MOTHERS begin to scream on the benches of the playground area.  \n[161] \n[162]Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down! \n[163]Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the police! \n[164]Where's the next stop?  Going into the city? \n[165]Police! \n[166] \n[167] Close shot of DOYLE from back seat, twisting, turning the car in a wild demonstration of pursuit driving around cars, braking, roaring ahead.    We move out through the windshield for a lurching, spinning, twisting view of the tracks overhead, the street signs and lights flashing by in a reeling montage of movement, the train roaring above it all.  \n[168] Side close view of DOYLE driving while he's looking up.  He skids through a red light, narrowly missing a pedestrian and an oncoming group of cars.  Long, low view of the train from DOYLE's position.  \n[169] Close side shot of DOYLE driving, skidding on streetcar tracks, panning upward to show the car pulling ahead of the train.    \n[170] Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO from the front.  DOYLE looks after ANGIE's car.  \n[171] Close shot through windshield of DOYLE and RUSSO.  MULDERIG and KLEIN in their car.  \n[172]Timezit? \n[173] Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street.  We can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just barely with the help of the street lights, four people in the car.  DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the beginning of approaching headlights again.  They grown brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it come.  \n[174] \n[175] \n[176]Up!  Up, you sonofabitch! \n[177]Of all the goddam cars they had to pick to steal hubcaps. \n[178] \n[179]Tumble it.  One end to the other. \n[180]I don't buy it.  The stuff is on this car. \n[181] \n[182]The sonofabitch is in here somewhere. I saw him -- I'm gonna get him. ", "Lou": "", "Angie": "\n[1] \n[2]Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight. \n[3]-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you. \n[4]Well try, okay? \n[5]Sal -- \n[6]Don't forget anchovies. ", "Pierre": "", "Nicoli": "\n[1]Au poil. \n[2]Il fallait le faire. \n[3]Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous. \n[4]J'ai pas confiance en lui. \n[5]What happens to the schedule? \n[6]But will they? \n[7]He is not wrong. \n[8]Let me take him out. \n[9]What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday. \n[10] NICOLI panics and runs.  The officer goes after him and traps him against the door between cars.  \n[11]Don't stop!  Continue on to the next station! \n[12]Touch the brake and I'll blow you in half. \n[13]Get back. "}}
