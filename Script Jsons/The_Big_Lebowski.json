Elfranco, my robe. \t\tMy art has been commended as being \t\tstrongly vaginal.  Which bothers \t\tsome men.  The word itself makes \t\tsome men uncomfortable.  Vagina.  \n[2]\t\tYes, they don't like hearing it and \t\tfind it difficult to say.  Whereas \t\twithout batting an eye a man will \t\trefer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or \t\this \"Johnson\".  \n[3]\t\tThank you.  This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.  All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give. Now.  As for this. . . \"kidnapping\"--  \n[4]\t\tYes, I know about it.  And I know \t\tthat you acted as courier.  And let \t\tme tell you something:  the whole \t\tthing stinks to high heaven.  \n[5]\t\tDo you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?  \n[6]\t\tSex.  The physical act of love. \t\tCoitus.  Do you like it?  \n[7]\t\tYou're not interested in sex?  \n[8]\t\tI like it too.  It's a male myth \t\tabout feminists that we hate sex. \t\tIt can be a natural, zesty enterprise. \t\tBut unfortunately there are some \t\tpeople--it is called satyriasis in \t\tmen, nymphomania in women--who engage \t\tin it compulsively and without joy.  \n[9]\t\tYes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate \t\tsouls cannot love in the true sense \t\tof the word.  Our mutual acquaintance \t\tBunny is one of these.  \n[10]\t\tTake a look at this, sir.  She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen flickers to life.  A title card:  \n[11]\t\tAnd you recognize her, of course.  The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.  Bunny The TV is in here.  \n[12]\t\t\t \t\tThe story is ludicrous.  \n[13]\t\tLord.  You can imagine where it goes \t\tfrom here.  \n[14]\t\tDon't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little \t\tmatter to me that this woman chose \t\tto pursue a career  in pornography, nor that she has been \"banging\" Jackie Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts and--  \n[15]\t\tLittle Lebowski Urban Achievers, \t\tyes, and proud we are of all of them. \t\tI asked my father about his withdrawal \t\tof a million dollars from the \t\tFoundation account and he told me \t\tabout this \"abduction\", but I tell \t\tyou it is preposterous.  This \t\tcompulsive  fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.  \n[16]\t\tI'm getting to your rug. My  father \t\tand I don't get along; he doesn't \t\tapprove of my lifestyle and, needless \t\tto say, I don't approve of his. \t\tStill, I hardly wish to make my \t\tfather's embezzlement a police matter, \t\tso I'm proposing that you try to \t\trecover the money from the people \t\tyou delivered it to.  \n[17]\t\tIf you successfully do so, I will \t\tcompensate you to the tune of 1% of \t\tthe recovered sum.  \n[18]\t\tThousand, yes, bones or clams or \t\twhatever you call them.  \n[19]\t\t--your rug, yes, well with that money \t\tyou can buy any number of rugs that \t\tdon't have sentimental value for me. \t\tAnd I am sorry about that crack on \t\tthe jaw.  The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has all but disappeared.  \n[20]\t\tHere's the name and number of a doctor \t\twho will look at it for you.  You \t\twill receive no bill.  He's a good \t\tman, and thorough.  \n[21]\t\tPlease see him, Jeffrey.  He's a \t\tgood man, and thorough.  \n[22] She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.  \n[23]\t\tJeffrey, you haven't gone to the \t\tdoctor.  \n[24]\t\tDo you have any news regarding my \t\tfather's money?  \n[25]\t\tShe most certainly was not!  \n[26]\t\tAnd please don't call her my mother.  \n[27]\t\tShe is most definitely the perpetrator \t\tand not the victim.  \n[28]\t\tFrom who?  \n[29]\t\tDieter Hauff?  \n[30]\t\tHer \"co-star\" in the beaver picture?  \n[31]\t\tDieter has been on the fringes of-- \t\twell, of everything in L.A., for \t\tabout twenty years.  Look at my LP's. \t\tUnder 'Autobahn.'  The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.  \n[32]\t\tThat was his group--they released \t\tone album in the mid-seventies.  The Dude stops between two albums.  \n[33]\t\tHuh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their \t\tmusic is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.  The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture  \n[34]\t\tIs he pretending to be the abductor?  \n[35]\t\tLook, Jeffrey, you don't really \t\tkidnap someone that you're acquainted \t\twith.  You can't get away with it if \t\tthe hostage knows who you are.  \n[36]\t\tSo Dieter has the money?  \n[37]\t\tDo you still have that doctor's \t\tnumber?  \n[38]\t\tPlease Jeffrey.  I don't want to be \t\tresponsible for any delayed after- \t\teffects.  \n[39]\t\tI want you to see him immediately.  She is picking up a telephone.  \n[40]\t\tI'll see if he's available.  He's a \t\tgood man, and thorough.  \n[41] \n[42]\t\tJeffrey.  \n[43]\t\tLove me.  The Dude is stupefied.  \n[44]\t\tTell me a little about yourself, \t\tJeffrey.  \n[45]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[46]\t\tMmnun.  Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie next to each other in bed.  \n[47]\t\tOh?  \n[48]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[49]\t\tWhat do you do for fun?  \n[50]\t\tWhat happened to your house?  \n[51]\t\tFinder's fee?  \n[52]\t\tIt's not my father's money, it's the \t\tFoundation's.  Why did he think you \t\thad it?  And who does?  \n[53]\t\tJeffrey--  \n[54]\t\tI keep telling you, it's the \t\tFoundation's money.  Father doesn't \t\thave any.  \n[55]\t\tNo no, the wealth was all Mother's.  \n[56]\t\tWe did let Father run one of the \t\tcompanies, briefly, but he didn't do \t\tvery well at it.  \n[57]\t\tHe helps administer the charities \t\tnow, and I give him a reasonable \t\tallowance.  He has no money of his \t\town.  I know how he likes to present \t\thimself; Father's weakness is vanity. \t\tHence the slut.  \n[58]\t\tIt increases the chances of \t\tconception.  The Dude spits some White Russian.  \n[59]\t\tWell yes, what did you think this \t\twas all about?  Fun and games?  \n[60]\t\tI want a child.  \n[61]\t\tLook, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. \t\tIn fact I don't want the father to \t\tbe someone I have to see socially, \t\tor who'll have any interest in rearing \t\tthe child himself.  \n[62]\t\tExactly.  What happened to your face? \t\tDid Jackie Treehorn do that as well?  The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is absent.  \n[63]\t\tWhat?  The Dude is leaving the bedroom.  \n[64]\t\tWhat're you talking about?  Beep.  \n[65]\t\tJeffrey?  ", "Lebowski": "\n[1] We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices gently singing \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:  \n[2]\t\tOkay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a \t\tLebowski, that's terrific, I'm very \t\tbusy so what can I do for you?  He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him as Brandt withdraws.  \n[3]\t\tYou told Brandt on the phone, he \t\ttold me.  So where do I fit in?  \n[4]\t\tI'll say it again, all right?  You \t\ttold Brandt.  He told me.  I know \t\twhat happened. Yes?  Yes?  \n[5]\t\tDid I urinate on your rug?  \n[6]\t\tHello!  Do you speak English?  Parla \t\tusted Inglese?  I'll say it again. \t\tDid I urinate on your rug?  \n[7]\t\tHello!  Hello!  So every time--I \t\tjust want to understand this, sir-- \t\tevery time a rug is micturated upon \t\tin this fair city, I have to \t\tcompensate the--  \n[8]\t\tYou're just looking for a handout \t\tlike every other--are you employed, \t\tMr. Lebowski?  \n[9]\t\tAre you employed, sir?  \n[10]\t\tYou don't go out and make a living \t\tdressed like that in the middle of a \t\tweekday.  \n[11]\t\tBut I do work, so if you don't mind--  \n[12]\t\tMy wife is not the issue here. I \t\thope that my wife will someday learn \t\tto live on her allowance, which is \t\tample, but if she doesn't, sir, that \t\twill be her problem, not mine, just \t\tas your rug is your problem, just as \t\tevery bum's lot in life is his own \t\tresponsibility regardless of whom he \t\tchooses to blame.  I didn't blame \t\tanyone for the loss of my legs, some \t\tchinaman in Korea took them from me \t\tbut I went out and achieved anyway. \t\tI can't solve your problems, sir, \t\tonly you can.  The Dude rises.  \n[13]\t\tSure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer! \t\tTattoo it on your forehead!  Your \t\tanswer to everything!  The Dude is heading for the door.  \n[14]\t\tYour \"revolution\" is over, Mr. \t\tLebowski!  Condolences!  The bums \t\tlost!  As the Dude opens the door.  \n[15]\t\t...My advice is, do what your parents \t\tdid!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will \t\talways lose-- do you hear me, \t\tLebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--  The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find himself--  \n[16]\t\tIt's funny.  I can look back on a \t\tlife of achievement, on challenges \t\tmet, competitors bested, obstacles \t\tovercome.  I've accomplished more \t\tthan most men, and without the use \t\tof my legs.  What. . . What makes a \t\tman, Mr. Lebowski?  \n[17]\t\tHuh?  \n[18]\t\tIs it. . . is it, being prepared to \t\tdo the right thing?  Whatever the \t\tprice?  Isn't that what makes a man?  \n[19]\t\tYou're joking.  But perhaps you're \t\tright.  The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.  \n[20]\t\tBunny.  He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks.  \n[21]\t\tBunny Lebowski. . . She is the light \t\tof my life.  Are you surprised at my \t\ttears, sir?  \n[22]\t\tStrong men also cry. . . Strong men \t\talso cry.  He clears his throat.  \n[23]\t\tI received this fax this morning.  Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude.  \n[24]\t\tAs you can see, it is a ransom note. \t\tSent by cowards.  Men who are unable \t\tto achieve on a level field of play. \t\tMen who will not sign their names. \t\tWeaklings.  Bums.  \n[25]\t\tBrandt will fill you in on the \t\tdetails.  He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall.  \n[26]\t\tStart talking and talk fast you lousy \t\tbum!  \n[27]\t\tWhere's my goddamn money, you bum?!  \n[28]\t\tThey did not receive the money, you \t\tnitwit!  They  did not receive the \t\tgoddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR \n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\t\tWhat in God's holy name are you \t\tblathering about?  \n[32]\t\t\t \t\tNo.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not \t\toccurred to me.  \n[33]\t\tBrandt, give him the envelope.  \n[34]\t\tSince you have failed to achieve, \t\teven in the modest task that was \t\tyour charge, since you have stolen \t\tmy money, and since you have \t\tunrepentantly betrayed my trust.  The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package.  \n[35]\t\tI have no choice but to tell these \t\tbums that they should do whatever is \t\tnecessary to recover their money \t\tfrom you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And \t\twith Brandt as my witness, tell you \t\tthis:  Any further harm visited upon \t\tBunny, shall be visited tenfold upon \t\tyour head.  Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.  \n[36]\t\t...By God sir.  I will not abide \t\tanother toe.  \n[37] \n[38] Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out.  Both are gaping off at the front lawn.  \n[39]\t\t\t \t\tWell, she's back.  No thanks to you.  \n[40]\t\tWho the hell is he?  \n[41]\t\tWell, you have your story, I have \t\tmine.  I say I entrusted the money \t\tto you, and you stole it.  \n[42]\t\tWell?  Aren't you?  \n[43]\t\tAll right, get out.  Both of you.  \n[44]\t\tI said out.  Now.  \n[45]\t\tStay away from me, mister!  Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits.  \n[46]\t\tPut me down, you son of a bitch!  \n[47]\t\t\t \t\tYou're bullies!  Cowards, both of \t\tyou!  Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the floor.  \n[48]\t\tYou monsters!  \n[49]\t\tStay away from me!  You bullies! \t\tYou and these women!  You won't leave \t\ta man his fucking balls!  ", "Smokey": "\n[1]\t\tBullshit.  Eight, Dude.  \n[2]\t\tBullshit. Walter!  \n[3]\t\tYeah, but--  \n[4]\t\tYeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the \t\tmarker, Dude,  I'm marking it an \t\teight.  Walter takes out a gun.  \n[5]\t\tI'm not--  \n[6]\t\tLook Dude, I don't hold with this. \t\tThis guy is your partner, you should--  Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.  \n[7]\t\tWalter--  \n[8]\t\tAll right!  There it is!  It's fucking \t\tzero!  He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.  \n[9]\t\tYou happy, you crazy fuck?  ", "The": "\n[1] We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices gently singing \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and a deep, affable, Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:  \n[2] \n[3] \n[4] Looking.  \n[5] Donny calls out from the bench:  \n[6]\n[7]\n[8] The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.  \n[9]\t\tMr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, \t\twell--at Mr. Lebowski's office. \t\tPlease call us as soon as is \t\tconvenient.  Beep.  \n[10]\t\tMr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski \t\twith the Southern Cal Bowling League. \t\tI just got a, an informal report, \t\tuh, that a uh, a member of your team, \t\tuh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded \t\tweapon during league play--  We hear the doorbell.  \n[11] It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.  \n[12] The  voice continues on the machine.  \n[13] \n[14]\n[15] Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's conversation continues over.  \n[16] They have been joined by Donny.  \n[17] An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is in place. The rug is gone.  The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue. The beeps continue.  The phone starts to jangle.  \n[18] The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.  \n[19] \n[20] He scowls.  \n[21]\n[22] The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.  \n[23] A waitress enters.  \n[24] \n[25] \n[26] \n[27]\t\tThat's a good one.  Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.  \n[28]\t\tHow ya doin' there, Dude?  The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.  \n[29]\t\tOne a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser \t\tfella than m'self once said, sometimes \t\tyou eat the bar and sometimes the \t\tbar, wal, he eats you.  \n[30]\t\tFar from it.  \n[31]\t\tMuch obliged.  He looks back at the Dude.  \n[32]\t\tI like your style, Dude.  \n[33] \n[34]\t\tThankie. . . Just one thing, Dude. \t\tD'ya have to use s'many cuss words?  The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is.  \n[35]\t\tOkay, have it your way.  He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.  \n[36]\t\tTake it easy, Dude.  \n[37] Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning.  \n[38]\n[39] His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of \"Comin' Up Around the Bend.\"  Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.  \n[40] His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it out the driver's window--except that the window is not open. The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering sparks.  \n[41] The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone poll.  \n[42] The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which also won't open.  \n[43] We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, is performing a dance moderne.  As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse audience.  \n[44] Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman.  \n[45] \n[46] \n[47] Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs bark.  \n[48] \n[49] He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.  \n[50] Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.  \n[51] We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved- in windows.  The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the  road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 'on In-and-Out Burgers.  Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.  \n[52] The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.  \n[53] Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes.  \n[54]\t\tDarkness warshed over the Dude-- \t\tdarker'n a black steer's tookus on a \t\tmoonless prairie night.  There was \t\tno bottom.  We hear a thundering bass.  \n[55] \n[56] \n[57] The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.  \n[58] It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a kite, is Bunny Lebowski.  \n[59] On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.  When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.  Five more toes.  \n[60] \n[61] \n[62] \n[63] He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His attention is caught by something down the street.  \n[64] Striding purposefully down the street.  \n[65] As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground. He is revved with nervous energy.  \n[66]\t\tPAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell \t\thappened?  He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where Walter is looking.  \n[67] Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out.  Both are gaping off at the front lawn.  \n[68] Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a palm trunk.  \n[69] Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters in from a boom box by the pool.  Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the length of the hall.  \n[70] The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His wheelchair hums as he spins it around.  \n[71] \n[72] Dieter drops it.  \n[73] ---  They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.  A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.  \n[74]\n[75] \n[76] We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before. They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his bowling shirt.  \n[77]\t\tHowdy do, Dude.  \n[78]\t\tWouldn't miss the semis.  How things \t\tbeen goin'?  \n[79]\t\tSure, I gotcha.  The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.  \n[80]\t\tSure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know \t\tthat you will.  \n[81] \n[82]\t\tThe Dude abides.  He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into the camera.  \n[83]\t\tI don't know about you, but I take \t\tcomfort in that.  It's good knowin' \t\the's out there, the Dude, takin' her \t\teasy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I \t\tsure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, \t\tthat about does her, wraps her all \t\tup.  Things seem to've worked out \t\tpretty good for the Dude'n Walter, \t\tand it was a purt good story, dontcha \t\tthink?   Made me laugh to beat the \t\tband.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I \t\tdidn't like seein' Donny go. But \t\tthen, happen to know that there's a \t\tlittle Lebowski on the way.  I guess \t\tthat's the way the whole durned human \t\tcomedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, \t\tdown through the generations, westward \t\tthe wagons, across the sands a time \t\tuntil-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' \t\tagain.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed \t\tyourselves.  He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull back.  \n[84]\t\tCatch ya further on down the trail.  As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his voice fades:  \n[85]\t\t...Say friend, ya got any more a \t\tthat good sarsaparilla?...     </html> ", "Dude": "\n[1]\t\tIt's the LeBaron.  \n[2] The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.  \n[3]\t\tIt's uh, it's down there somewhere. \t\tLemme take another look.  His head is plunged back in.  \n[4]\t\tOh, man.  Don't do--  \n[5]\t\tLook, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You \t\tgot the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, \t\tman.  \n[6]\t\tBunny?  Look, moron.  He holds up his hands.  \n[7]\t\tYou see a wedding ring?  Does this \t\tplace look like I'm fucking married? \t\tAll my plants are dead!  The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native.  \n[8]\t\tObviously you're not a golfer.  The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.  \n[9]\t\tHey.  At least I'm housebroken.  The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.  \n[10]\t\tYeah man, it really tied the room \t\ttogether--  \n[11]\t\tWhat's your point, Walter?  \n[12]\t\tWhat's the point of--we all know who \t\twas at fault, so what the fuck are \t\tyou talking about?  \n[13]\t\tMy rug.  \n[14]\t\tThis Chinaman who peed on my rug, I \t\tcan't go give him a bill so what the \t\tfuck are you talking about?  \n[15]\t\tWalter, this is not a guy who built \t\tthe rail- roads, here, this is a guy \t\twho peed on my--  \n[16]\t\tWalter, he peed on my rug--  \n[17]\t\tSo who--  \n[18]\t\tNo, but--  \n[19]\t\tYeah, but--  \n[20]\t\tFuckin' A.  \n[21]\t\tYeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--  \n[22]\t\tYeah, this is the guy, this guy should \t\tcompensate me for the fucking rug. \t\tI mean his wife goes out and owes \t\tmoney and they pee on my rug.  \n[23]\t\tYes, uh, very impressive.  \n[24]\t\tI'm not really, uh.  \n[25]\t\tUh-huh.  We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and  certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:  \n[26]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[27]\t\tHey, is this him with Nancy?  \n[28]\t\tLebowski on the right?  \n[29]\t\tHe's handicapped, huh?  \n[30]\t\tFar out.  \n[31]\t\tNancy's pretty good.  \n[32]\t\tAre these.  \n[33]\t\tDifferent mothers, huh?  \n[34]\t\tI guess he's pretty, uh, racially \t\tpretty cool--  \n[35]\t\tI see.  \n[36]\t\tJeez.  Think he's got room for one \t\tmore?  \n[37]\t\tWell, yeah I did, but I spent most \t\tof my time occupying various, um, \t\tadministration buildings--  \n[38]\t\t--smoking thai-stick, breaking into \t\tthe ROTC--  \n[39]\t\t--and bowling.  I'll tell you the \t\ttruth, Brandt, I don't remember most \t\tof it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!  Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the display is mirrored.  We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.  So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.  Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.  \n[40]\t\tWell sir, it's this rug I have, really \t\ttied the room together-  \n[41]\t\tWell they were looking for you, these \t\ttwo guys, they were trying to--  \n[42]\t\tSo you know they were trying to piss \t\ton your rug--  \n[43]\t\tYou mean, did you personally come \t\tand pee on my--  \n[44]\t\tWell no, like I said, Woo peed on \t\tthe rug--  \n[45]\t\tCome on, man, I'm not trying to scam \t\tanybody here, I'm just--  \n[46]\t\tLook, let me explain something. \t\tI'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. \t\tLebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's \t\twhat  you  call me.  That, or Duder. \t\tHis  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, \t\tyou know, you're not into the whole \t\tbrevity thing--  \n[47]\t\tEmployed?  \n[48]\t\tIs this a--what day is this?  \n[49]\t\tNo, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. \t\tThis will not stand, ya know, this \t\twill not stand, man.  I mean, if \t\tyour wife owes--  \n[50]\t\tAh fuck it.  \n[51]\t\tOkay.  The old man told me to take \t\tany rug in the house.  \n[52]\t\tIt's the LeBaron.  \n[53] Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.  Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the pool.  \n[54]\t\tYeah sure, if I'm ever in the \t\tneighborhood, need to use the john.  \n[55] Looking.  \n[56]\t\tHuh?  She waggles her foot and giggles.  \n[57]\t\tYou want me to blow on your toes?  \n[58]\t\tYou sure he won't mind?  The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin. One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs.  \n[59]\t\tPracticing?  The young woman smiles.  \n[60]\t\tYou're Bunny?  \n[61]\t\tI'm just gonna find a cash machine.  \n[62]\t\tYour maples, Carl.  Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.  \n[63]\t\tYou're fucking twenty minutes late. \t\tWhat the fuck is that?  \n[64]\t\tHuh?  \n[65]\t\tWhat the fuck're you talking about? \t\tThe carrier.  What's in the fucking \t\tcarrier?  \n[66]\t\tWhat the fuck are you--  \n[67]\t\tYou brought a fucking Pomeranian \t\tbowling?  \n[68]\t\tHey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked \t\tme to take care of her fucking dog \t\twhile she and her boyfriend went to \t\tHonolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck \t\therself.  Why can't she board it?  \n[69]\t\tHey man--  \n[70]\t\tCome on Walter, it's just--it's \t\tSmokey.  So his toe slipped over a \t\tlittle, it's just a game.  \n[71]\t\tHey Walter--  \n[72]\t\tWalter, they're calling the cops, \t\tput the piece away.  \n[73]\t\tWalter, you can't do that.  These \t\tguys're like me, they're pacificists. \t\tSmokey was a conscientious objector.  \n[74]\t\tAnd you know Smokey has emotional \t\tproblems!  \n[75]\t\tHe's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!  As the two men get into the car:  \n[76]\t\tNo, you're not wrong--  \n[77]\t\tYou're not wrong, Walter, you're \t\tjust an asshole.  They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.  \n[78]\t\tJust, just take it easy, Walter.  \n[79]\t\tWell, just take 't easy, man.  \n[80]\t\tYeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!  \n[81]\t\tJust take it easy, man!  Walter is still smug.  \n[82] A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat- up old furniture.  At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing kalhua, rum and milk.  \n[83]\t\tShit!  \n[84]\t\tHiya Allan.  \n[85]\t\tSure Allan, I'll be there.  \n[86]\t\tYeah, yeah I know. Okay.  \n[87]\t\tYeah, okay.  \n[88]\t\tHuh.  Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.  \n[89]\t\tDude.  \n[90]\t\tI don't know, sir.  \n[91]\t\tSure.  That and a pair of testicles.  Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost in thought.  \n[92]\t\tMind if I smoke a jay?  \n[93]\t\t'Scuse me?  \n[94]\t\tFuckin' A.  \n[95] \n[96]\t\tBummer.  Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.  \n[97]\t\tWhy me, man?  \n[98]\t\tSo he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, \t\thuh?  \n[99]\t\tFucking Quintana--that creep can \t\troll, man--  \n[100]\t\tHuh?  \n[101]\t\tHuh.  \n[102] They have been joined by Donny.  \n[103]\t\tTwenty grand.  And of course I still \t\tkeep the rug.  \n[104]\t\tYeah.  He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.  \n[105]\t\t...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so \t\twhenever these guys call--  \n[106]\t\tI told him if it was during league \t\tplay--  Donny has been watching Quintana.  \n[107]\t\tI figure it's easy money, it's all \t\tpretty harmless.  I mean she probably \t\tkidnapped herself.  \n[108]\t\tRug-peers did not do this.  I mean \t\tlook at it.  Young trophy wife. \t\tMarries a guy for money but figures \t\the isn't giving her enough.  She \t\towes money all over town--  \n[109]\t\tIt's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin \t\tsaid, look for the person who will \t\tbenefit.  And you will, uh, you know, \t\tyou'll, uh, you know what I'm trying \t\tto say--  \n[110]\t\tYeah.  \n[111]\t\tYeah, well, what do you care, Walter?  \n[112]\t\tI don't see any connection to Vietnam, \t\tWalter.  \n[113]\t\tWalter, face it, there isn't any \t\tconnection.  It's your roll.  \n[114]\t\tIt's your roll--  \n[115]\t\tIt's your roll.  \n[116]\t\tYeah well, that's just, ya know, \t\tlike, your opinion, man.  Quintana looks at Walter.  \n[117]\t\tJesus.  \n[118] We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug. His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter.  In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE \n[119]\t\tOh man.  He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.  \n[120]\t\tOh, nothin', you know.  They have reached the little desk outside of the big Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.  \n[121]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[122]\t\tOh, man, don't say that..  \n[123]\t\tShit.  \n[124] We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper.  The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase.  \n[125]\t\tThe what?  \n[126]\t\tWhat the hell is this?  \n[127]\t\tAgh--  He closes the briefcase.  \n[128]\t\tWalter, I'm sure there's a reason \t\tyou brought your dirty undies--  \n[129]\t\tWalter--what the fuck are you \t\tthinking?  \n[130]\t\tWe?  What the fuck we?  You said you \t\tjust wanted to come along--  \n[131]\t\tYes you're wrong.  This isn't a \t\tfucking game, Walter--  \n[132]\t\tYeah, but--  The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.  \n[133]\t\tDude here.  \n[134]\t\tDude the Bagman.  Where do you want \t\tus to go?  \n[135] Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not handling the money and driving the car and talking on the phone all by my fucking--  \n[136]\t\tYeah?  \n[137]\t\tThe driver man, I told you--  Click.  Dial tone.  \n[138]\t\tOh shit.  Walter.  \n[139]\t\tThey hung up, Walter!  You fucked it \t\tup!  You fucked it up!  Her life was \t\tin our hands!  \n[140]\t\tWe're screwed now!  We don't get \t\tshit and they're gonna kill her! \t\tWe're fucked, Walter!  \n[141]\t\tShutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say \t\tpeep when I'm doing business here.  \n[142]\t\tDude here.  \n[143]\t\tYeah.  \n[144]\t\tHey, just tell me where the fuck you \t\twant us to go.  \n[145]\t\tThat was the sign.  Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.  \n[146]\t\tTerrific, Walter.  But you haven't \t\ttold me how we get her back.  Where \t\tis she?  \n[147]\t\tYeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. \t\tThat's fucking ingenious, if I \t\tunderstand it correctly.  That's a \t\tSwiss fucking watch.  \n[148]\t\tDude.  \n[149]\n[150]\t\tThere is no fucking hand-off, Walter! \t\tAt a wooden bridge we throw the money \t\tout  of the car!  \n[151]\t\tWe throw the money out of the moving \t\tcar!  Walter stares dumbly for a beat.  \n[152]\t\tWell call them up and explain it to \t\t'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking \t\tsimple, I'm sure they'd fucking \t\tunderstand it!  That's the beauty of \t\tit Walter!  \n[153]\t\tI'm throwing the money, Walter! \t\tWe're not fucking around!  \n[154]\t\tFuck that!  I love you, Walter, but \t\tsooner or later you're gonna have to \t\tface the fact that you're a goddamn \t\tmoron.  \n[155]\t\tWalter!  \n[156]\t\tWhat the fuck?  \n[157]\t\tUzi?  Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.  \n[158]\t\tWalter, please--  Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road.  \n[159]\n[160]\t\tWE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!  The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away.  \n[161]\t\tWhat the fuck is that supposed to \t\tmean?  What the fuck're we gonna \t\ttell Lebowski?  \n[162]\t\tHuh?  The problem is--what do you \t\tmean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- \t\tthey're gonna kill that poor woman--  \n[163]\t\tNo, Walter!  I said I thought she \t\tkidnapped herself!  You're the one \t\twho's so fucking certain--  \n[164]\t\tWalter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?  \n[165]\t\tWalter--  \n[166]\t\tWho gives a shit, Walter?  What about \t\tthat poor woman?  What do we tell--  \n[167]\t\tYeah, and in the meantime what do I \t\ttell Lebowski?  \n[168]\t\tWalter, how--  \n[169]\t\tThat's it.  I'm out of here.  \n[170]\t\tBut Walter, we didn't make the fucking \t\thand- off!  They didn't get, the \t\tfucking money and they're gonna-- \t\tthey're gonna--  \n[171]\t\tWalter--  \n[172]\t\t\"Our\" car, Walter?  \n[173]\t\tYou don't know, Walter?  You seem to \t\tknow the answer to everything else!  \n[174]\t\tIt's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking \t\tknow it's been stolen!  \n[175]\t\tAw, fuck it.  The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts ringing again.  \n[176]\t\tI'm going home, Donny.  \n[177]\t\tThank you, Donny.  \n[178] The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, the other a fresh-faced rookie.  At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping. The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:  \n[179]\t\t1972 Pontiac LeBaron.  \n[180]\t\tGreen.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, \t\tcoloration.  \n[181]\t\tHuh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple \t\tof Creedence tapes.  And there was \t\ta, uh. . . my briefcase.  \n[182]\t\tPapers.  Just papers.  You know, my \t\tpapers.  Business papers.  \n[183]\t\tI'm unemployed.  \n[184]\t\t...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But \t\tit's nice when they offer.  \n[185]\t\t...Also, my rug was stolen.  \n[186]\t\tNo.  Here.  \n[187]\t\tYou find them much?  Stolen cars?  Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message after the beep.  It takes a minute.  \n[188]\t\tAnd the, uh, the briefcase?  Beep.  \n[189]\t\tIs that what that's a picture of?  \n[190]\t\tOh yeah?  \n[191]\t\t\"Johnson\"?  \n[192]\t\tHuh?  \n[193]\t\tRight, but let me explain something \t\tabout that rug--  \n[194]\t\tExcuse me?  \n[195]\t\tI was talking about my rug.  \n[196]\t\tYou mean coitus?  \n[197]\t\tOh, no.  \n[198]\t\tListen, Maude, I'm sorry if your \t\tstepmother is a nympho, but I don't \t\tsee what it has to do with--do you \t\thave any kalhua?  \n[199]\t\tShit, I know that guy.  He's a \t\tnihilist.  \n[200]\t\tHe fixes the cable?  \n[201]\t\tShit yeah, the achievers.  \n[202]\t\tYeah, but my-  \n[203]\t\tWell--sure, I could do that--  \n[204]\t\tA hundred.  \n[205]\t\tYeah, but what about--  \n[206]\t\tOh that's okay, I hardly even--  \n[207]\t\tThat's really thoughtful but I--  \n[208]\t\tFuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.\t\t\t \t\tFuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya \t\tTony.  He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves milk on his mustache.  I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a little  money, I  was down in the dumps.  \n[209]\t\tYeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be \t\tworrying about that shit.  Life goes \t\ton!  The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still holding his drink.  \n[210]\t\tHuh?  His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder.  He followed us here.  The Dude turns to look.  \n[211] He scowls.  \n[212]\t\tWhen did he-  The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half- nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.  \n[213]\t\tFuck, man!  There's a beverage here!  The waiting limo's back door is flung open.  \n[214]\t\tWell we--I don't--  \n[215]\t\tNo, man, nothing is fucked here--  \n[216]\t\tC'mon man, who're you gonna believe? \t\tThose guys are--we dropped off the \t\tdamn money--  \n[217]\t\tI--the royal we, you know, the \t\teditorial--I dropped off the money, \t\texactly as per--Look, I've got certain \t\tinformation, certain things have \t\tcome to light, and uh, has it ever \t\toccurred to you, man, that given the \t\tnature of all this new shit, that, \t\tuh, instead of running around blaming \t\tme, that this whole thing might just \t\tbe, not, you know, not just such a \t\tsimple, but uh--you know?  \n[218]\t\tI'll tell you what I'm blathering \t\tabout!  I got information--new shit \t\thas come to light and--shit, man! \t\tShe kidnapped herself!  Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.  \n[219]\t\tWell sure, look at it!  Young trophy \t\twife, I mean, in the parlance of our \t\ttimes, owes money all over town, \t\tincluding to known pornographers-- \t\tand that's cool, that's cool-- but \t\tI'm saying, she needs money, and of \t\tcourse they're gonna say they didn't \t\tget it 'cause she wants more, man, \t\tshe's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- \t\thasn't that ever occurred to you...? \t\tSir?  \n[220]\t\tWell, okay, you're not privy to all \t\tthe new shit, so uh, you know, but \t\tthat's what you pay me for.  Speaking \t\tof which, would it be possible for \t\tme to get my twenty grand in cash? \t\tI gotta check this with my accountant \t\tof course, but my concern is that, \t\tyou know, it could bump me into a \t\thigher tax--  \n[221]\t\tWell, okay, if you've already made \t\tout the check.  Brandt is handing \t\thim a letter-sized envelope which is \t\tdistended by something inside.  \n[222]\t\tWhose toe was it, Walter?  \n[223]\t\tThe nail polish, Walter.  \n[224]\t\tSomeone else's--where the fuck are \t\tthey gonna--  \n[225]\t\tBut Walter--  \n[226]\t\tThey're gonna kill her, Walter, and \t\tthen they're gonna kill me--  \n[227]\t\tWhat about the toe?  \n[228]\t\tWalter, this isn't a First Amendment \t\tthing.  \n[229] \n[230]\t\tAll right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry \t\tma'am.  \n[231] A dripping noise.  The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.  We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.  The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.  After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:  \n[232]\t\tFar out.  Far fuckin' out.  \n[233]\t\tHunh?  He looks blearily at the open doorway.  A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is striding across the living room towards the bathroom.  \n[234]\t\tHey!  This is a private residence, \t\tman!  The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other men are entering behind him.  The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; the men are backlit shapes.  One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor.  The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.  \n[235]\t\tNice marmot.  The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub.  The Dude screams.  The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression.  \n[236]\t\tJesus!  \n[237]\t\tJesus Christ!  \n[238]\t\tExcuse me?  \n[239]\t\tMy fucking briefcase!  It's not here!  \n[240]\t\tMy fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's \t\tthat smell?  \n[241]\t\tWhen will you find these guys?  I \t\tmean, do you have any promising leads?  The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.  \n[242]\t\tI figure my only hope is that the \t\tbig Lebowski kills me before the \t\tGermans can cut my dick off.  \n[243]\t\tThanks Walter.  \n[244]\t\t\t \t\tYeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me \t\ta very secure feeling.  \n[245]\t\tThat makes me feel all warm inside.  \n[246]\t\tThis whole fucking thing--I  could \t\tbe sitting here with just pee-stains \t\ton my rug.  Walter sadly shakes his head.  \n[247]\t\tThey're nihilists.  \n[248]\t\tThey kept saying they believe in \t\tnothing.  \n[249]\t\tYeah.  \n[250]\t\tWhat're you, a fucking park ranger \t\tnow?  \n[251]\t\tWho gives a shit about the fucking \t\tmarmot!  \n[252]\t\tFuck your sympathy!  I don't need \t\tyour sympathy, man, I need my fucking \t\tJohnson!  \n[253]\t\tFuck the tournament!  Fuck you, \t\tWalter!  There is a moment of stunned silence.  \n[254]\t\tAnother Caucasian, Gary.  \n[255]\t\tFriends like these, huh Gary.  \n[256]\t\tAhh, not so good, man.  \n[257]\t\t\t \t\tUh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern \t\tthing?  \n[258]\t\tMm.  The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.  \n[259] \n[260]\t\tWell I like your style too, man. \t\tGot a whole cowboy thing goin'.  \n[261]\t\tThe fuck are you talking about?  The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar.  \n[262]\t\tYeah.  Thanks man.  He is gone.  \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" is ending as we hear an offscreen voice, breaking the spell:  \n[263] Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, beckoning.  \n[264]\t\tNo it's fine, really, uh--  \n[265]\t\tI, uh... money, yeah, I gotta \t\trespecfully, 69 you know, tender my \t\tresignation on that matter, 'cause \t\tit looks like your mother really was \t\tkidnapped after all.  \n[266]\t\tHey man, why don't you fucking listen \t\toccasionally?  You might learn \t\tsomething.  Now I got--  \n[267]\t\tNow I got--  \n[268]\t\tI'm telling you, I got definitive \t\tevidence--  \n[269]\t\tThe main guy, Dieter--  \n[270]\t\tWell--yeah, I guess--  \n[271]\t\tBeaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, \t\tyou know him?  \n[272]\t\tRoy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.  \n[273]\t\tJeez.  I miss vinyl.  \n[274]\t\tWell...yeah--  \n[275]\t\tWell yeah...I know that.  \n[276]\t\tWell, no, not exactly.  It's a \t\tcomplicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. \t\tLotta outs.  And a lotta strands to \t\tkeep in my head, man.  Lotta strands \t\tin old Duder's--  \n[277]\t\tHuh?  No, really, I don't even have \t\tthe bruise any more, I--  She is scribbling.  \n[278]\t\tDelayed after-eff--  \n[279] His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of \"Comin' Up Around the Bend.\"  Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.  \n[280]\t\tHuh?  No, she, she hit me right here.  \n[281] The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror-- and, noticing something, looks again.  \n[282] His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it out the driver's window--except that the window is not open. The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering sparks.  \n[283] The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. The Dude screams.  \n[284]\t\tFuck Me.  But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from the lit butt.  He looks around for it.  Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion and back cushion.  \n[285]\t\tFuckola, man.  He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions. There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper sticking out from between the cushions.  The Dude pulls it out.  It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right- hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled \"The Louisiana Purchase.\"  In red ink is a large circled D and some handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled in red throughout.  \n[286]\t\tThe In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.  \n[287]\t\tWho the fuck is that?  \n[288]\t\tWho the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?  \n[289]\t\tYeah.  \n[290]\t\tYeah yeah, I know the fucking show \t\tWalter, so what?  \n[291]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[292]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[293]\t\tNo.  \n[294]\t\tUh.  \n[295]\t\tFuck me, man!  That kid's already \t\tspent all the money!  \n[296]\t\tLook, man, did you--  \n[297]\t\tJust ask him if he--ask him about \t\tthe car, man!  Walter is still holding out the homework.  \n[298]\t\tIs the car out front yours?  \n[299]\t\tWe know it's his fucking homework, \t\tWalter!  Where's the fucking money, \t\tyou little brat?  Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him.  \n[300]\t\tOh, for Christ's sake, Walter!  \n[301]\t\tAnd the fucking money!  \n[302]\t\tNo!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--  \n[303] We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved- in windows.  The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the  road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 'on In-and-Out Burgers.  Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.  \n[304] As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.  \n[305]\t\tI accept your apology. . . No I, I \t\tjust want to handle it myself from \t\tnow on. . . No.  That has nothing to \t\tdo with it. . . .Yes, it made it \t\thome, I'm calling from home.  No, \t\tWalter, it didn't look like Larry \t\twas about to crack.  He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby.  \n[306]\t\tWell that's your perception. . . \t\tWell you're right, Walter, and the \t\tunspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND \t\tLEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, \t\tI'll be at practice.  He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the floor.  \n[307]\t\tHuh?  Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, kicking the chair away.  \n[308]\t\tThis is quite a pad you got here, \t\tman.  Completely unspoiled.  \n[309]\t\tWhite Russian, thanks.  How's the \t\tsmut business, Jackie?  \n[310]\t\tWhich one was Logjammin'?  \n[311]\t\tOn you, maybe.  He hands him the drink.  \n[312]\t\tUh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off \t\tmanually.  \n[313]\t\tI thought you might know, man.  \n[314]\t\tBut she hasn't run off, she's been--  Treehorn waves this off.  \n[315]\t\tYeah, well, right man, there are \t\tmany facets to this, uh, you know, \t\tmany interested parties.  If I can \t\tfind your money, man-- what's in it \t\tfor the Dude?  \n[316]\t\tDoes the Pope shit in the woods?  \n[317]\t\tOkay, Jackie, done.  I like the way \t\tyou do business.  Your money is being \t\theld by a kid named Larry Sellers. \t\tHe lives in North Hollywood, on \t\tRadford, near the In-and-Out Burger. \t\tA real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure \t\tyour goons'll be able to get it off \t\thim, mean he's only fifteen and he's \t\tflunking social studies.  So if you'll \t\tjust write me a check for my ten per \t\tcent. . . of half a million. . . \t\tfifty grand.  He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.  \n[318]\t\tI'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you \t\tmix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.  The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.  \n[319]\t\tNo funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's \t\tgot it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just \t\twanted a car.  All the Dude ever \t\twanted. . . was his rug back. . . \t\tnot greedy. . . it really.  He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together.  He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.  \n[320] \n[321]\t\tHe was innocent.  Not a charge was \t\ttrue.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.  \n[322]\t\tI know my rights.  \n[323]\t\tI want a fucking lawyer, man.  I \t\twant Bill Kunstler.  \n[324]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[325]\t\tThat guy treats women like objects, \t\tman.  \n[326]\t\tI'm sorry, I wasn't listening.  The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere.  The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.  \n[327]\t\t--Ow!  Fucking fascist!  The Chief slaps him twice.  \n[328] The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap.  \n[329]\t\tJesus, man, can you change the \t\tstation?  \n[330]\t\tI've had a--  \n[331]\t\t--had a rough night, and I hate the \t\tfucking Eagles, man--  \n[332] The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.  \n[333]\t\tJesus.  The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.  Quiet.  The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.  The Dude cringes.  Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.  \n[334]\t\tMaude?  She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.  \n[335]\t\tThat's my robe.  \n[336]\t\tWell, uh. . . Not much to tell.  A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness except for the glowing tip of the joint.  \n[337]\t\tI was, uh, one of the authors of the \t\tPort Huron Statement.--The original \t\tPort Huron Statement.  \n[338]\t\tNot the compromised second draft. \t\tAnd then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the \t\tSeattle Seven?  \n[339]\t\tAnd then. . . let's see, I uh--music \t\tbusiness briefly.  \n[340]\t\tYeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed \t\tof Sound Tour.  \n[341]\t\tBunch of assholes.  And then, you \t\tknow, little of this, little of that. \t\tMy career's, uh, slowed down a bit \t\tlately.  \n[342]\t\tOh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. \t\tDrive around.  The occasional acid \t\tflashback.  He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised.  \n[343]\t\tJackie Treehorn trashed the place. \t\tWanted to save the finder's fee.  \n[344]\t\tHe thought I had your father's money, \t\tso he got me out of the way while he \t\tlooked for it.  \n[345]\t\tLarry Sellers, a high-school kid. \t\tReal fucking brat.  He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.  \n[346]\t\tIt's a complicated case, Maude. \t\tLotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately \t\tI've been adhering to a pretty strict, \t\tuh, drug regimen to keep my mind, \t\tyou know, limber.  I'm real fucking \t\tclose to your father's money, real \t\tfucking close.  It's just--  \n[347]\t\tHuh?  He's fucking loaded.  \n[348]\t\tBut your father--he runs stuff, he--  \n[349]\t\tBut he's--  \n[350]\t\tHuh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is \t\tthat yoga?  Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees pulled in.  \n[351]\t\tIncreases?  \n[352]\t\tWell...no, of course not--  \n[353]\t\tYeah, okay, but see, the Dude--  \n[354]\t\tHuh...  Something occurs to him.  \n[355]\t\tSo...that doctor.  \n[356]\t\tNo, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. \t\tA real reactionary. . . So your \t\tfather. . . Oh man, I get it!  \n[357]\t\tYeah, my thinking about the case, \t\tman, it had become uptight.  Yeah. \t\tYour father--  \n[358]\t\tWalter, if you're there, pick up the \t\tfucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, \t\tthis is an emergency.  I'm not--  \n[359]\t\tWalter, listen, I'm at my place, I \t\tneed you to come pick me up--  \n[360]\t\tHuh?  \n[361]\t\tIt is a fucking emergency.  \n[362]\t\tTHEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, \t\tjust call Donny then, and ask him to--  \n[363]\n[364] He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His attention is caught by something down the street.  \n[365] Striding purposefully down the street.  \n[366] As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground. He is revved with nervous energy.  \n[367]\t\tGet out of that fucking car, man!  The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out.  The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.  He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache.  The Dude shouts to cover his fear:  \n[368]\t\tWho the fuck are you, man!  Come on, \t\tman!  \n[369]\t\tWho the fuck are you?  Why've you \t\tbeen following me?  Come on, fuckhead!  \n[370]\t\tBrother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?  \n[371]\t\tHuh?  \n[372]\t\tI'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay \t\taway from my fucking lady friend, \t\tman.  \n[373]\t\tShe's not my special lady, she's my \t\tfucking lady friend.  I'm just helping \t\ther conceive, man!  \n[374]\t\tWho're you working for?  Lebowski? \t\tJackie Treehorn?  \n[375]\t\tThe?  Who the fff--  \n[376]\t\tJesus fucking Christ.  \n[377]\t\tBoy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on \t\tthe farm once they seen Karl Hungus.  He hands back the picture.  She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around.  \n[378]\t\tYeah, it sucks.  \n[379]\t\tYeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino. \t\tAnd stay away from my special la-- \t\tfrom my fucking lady friend.  The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping.  \n[380]\t\tI mean we totally fucked it up, man. \t\tWe fucked up his pay-off.  And got \t\tthe kidnappers all pissed off, and \t\tthe big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, \t\tbut he didn't do anything.  Huh?  \n[381]\t\tI'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- \t\tup, then why does he still leave me \t\tin charge of getting back his wife? \t\tBecause he fucking doesn't want her \t\tback, man!  He's had enough!  He no \t\tlonger digs her!  It's all a show! \t\tBut then, why didn't he give a shit \t\tabout his million bucks?  I mean, he \t\tknew we didn't hand off his briefcase, \t\tbut he never asked for it back.  \n[382]\t\tHis million bucks was never in it, \t\tman!  There was no money in that \t\tbriefcase!  He was hoping they'd \t\tkill her!  You throw out a ringer \t\tfor a ringer!  \n[383]\t\tShit yeah!  \n[384]\t\tHuh?  \n[385]\t\tWalter, come off it.  You're not \t\teven fucking Jewish, you're--  \n[386]\t\tYou're fucking Polish Catholic--  \n[387]\t\tYeah, and you were--  \n[388]\t\tAnd you were divorced five fucking \t\tyears ago.  \n[389]\t\tThis driveway.  \n[390]\t\tIt's just part of your whole sick \t\tCynthia thing.  Taking care of her \t\tfucking dog.  Going to her fucking \t\tsynagogue.  You're living in the \t\tfucking past.  \n[391]\t\tWhere'd she been?  \n[392]\t\tBut I guess she told Dieter.  \n[393]\t\tWhere's the money, Lebowski?  \n[394]\t\tWe know the briefcase was empty, \t\tman.  We know you kept the million \t\tbucks yourself.  \n[395]\t\tYou thought Bunny'd been kidnapped \t\tand you could use it as a pretext to \t\tmake some money disappear.  All you \t\tneeded was a sap to pin it on, and \t\tyou'd just met me.  You thought, \t\they, a deadbeat, a loser, someone \t\tthe square community won't give a \t\tshit about.  \n[396]\t\tWell. . . yeah.  \n[397]\t\tWalter!  \n[398]\n[399]\t\tHe can't walk, Walter!  \n[400]\t\tHelp me put him back in his chair.  Walter moves to comply.  \n[401]\t\tWalter, you fuck!  \n[402]\t\tWe're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.  The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and batting the dog away.  \n[403]\t\tThere ya go.  Sorry man.  Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.  \n[404] Each with a beer at the scoring table.  \n[405]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[406]\t\tYeah.  \n[407]\t\tThey finally did it.  They killed my \t\tfucking car.  \n[408]\t\tYou don't have the fucking girl, \t\tdipshits.  We know you never did. \t\tSo you've got nothin' on my Johnson.  \n[409] The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in German.  Under his breath:  \n[410]\t\tHey, cool it Walter.  Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:  \n[411]\t\tHey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, \t\tthere never was any money.  The big \t\tLebowski gave me an empty briefcase, \t\tman, so take it up with him.  \n[412]\t\tCome on, Walter, we're ending this \t\tthing cheap.  Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.  \n[413]\t\tCome on, Walter!.  Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:  \n[414]\t\tFour dollars here!  He inspects the change in his palm.  \n[415]\t\tAlmost five!  \n[416] He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks.  \n[417] Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.  \n[418] The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.  \n[419] With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.  As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.  Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is quiet.  All quiet.  Walter, panting, looks around.  \n[420]\t\tHy God!  They shot him, Walter!  \n[421]\t\tThey shot Donny!  Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.  \n[422]\t\tThen what's...  \n[423]\t\tWha.  \n[424]\t\tWha. . . Donny--  \n[425] ---  They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.  A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.  \n[426]\t\tYeah man.  \n[427]\t\tJeffrey Lebowski.  \n[428]\t\tThe Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.  \n[429]\t\tNothing.  \n[430]\t\tWell can we--  \n[431]\t\tCan we just rent it from you?  \n[432]\t\tWalter--  \n[433]\t\tHey man, don't you have something \t\telse you could put it in?  \n[434]\t\tGoddamnit Walter!  You fucking \t\tasshole!  \n[435]\t\tYou make everything a fucking \t\ttravesty!  \n[436]\t\tWhat about that shit about Vietnam!  \n[437]\t\tWhat the fuck does Vietnam have to \t\tdo with anything!  What the fuck \t\twere you talking about?!  Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost lost.  \n[438]\t\tYou're a fuck, Walter!  He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then wraps his arms around the Dude.  \n[439] We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before. They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his bowling shirt.  \n[440]\t\tTwo oat sodas, Gary.  \n[441]\t\tThanks, man.  \n[442]\t\tYeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you \t\teat the bear, and, uh.  \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" has come up on the jukebox, and The Stranger ambles up to the bar.  \n[443]\t\tOh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered \t\tif I'd see you again.  \n[444]\t\tAhh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, \t\tups and downs.  The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.  \n[445]\t\tThanks, Gary...Take care, man, I \t\tgotta get back.  \n[446] \n[447]\t\tYeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude \t\tabides.  Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:  ", "Jesus": "", "Quintana": "\n[1] wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.  Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his first name, \"Jesus\".  \n[2]\t\tI see you rolled your way into the \t\tsemis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and \t\tme, we're gonna fuck you up.  \n[3]\t\tLet me tell you something, bendeco. \t\tYou pull any your crazy shit with \t\tus, you flash a piece out on the \t\tlanes, I'll take it away from you \t\tand stick it up your ass and pull \t\tthe fucking trigger til it goes \t\t\"click\".  \n[4]\t\tYou said it, man.  Nobody fucks with \t\tthe Jesus.  Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.  \n[5]\t\tWhat's this \"day of rest\" shit, man?!  Walter looks at him innocently.  \n[6]\t\tWhat is this bullshit, man?  I don't \t\tfucking care!  It don't matter to \t\tJesus!  But you're not fooling me! \t\tYou might fool the fucks in the league \t\toffice, but you don't fool Jesus! \t\tIt's bush league psych-out stuff! \t\tLaughable, man!  I would've fucked \t\tyou in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck \t\tyou in the ass next Wednesday instead!  \n[7] He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him away.  \n[8]\t\tYou got a date Wednesday, man!  Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his shades, watch him go.  ", "Marty": "", "Bunny": "\n[1]\t\tI'll suck your cock for a thousand \t\tdollars.  Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:  \n[2]\t\tBrandt can't watch though.  Or he \t\thas to pay a hundred.  \n[3]\n[4] ", "Walter": "\n[1]\t\tThis was a valued rug.  He elaborately clears his throat.  \n[2]\t\tThis was, uh--  \n[3]\t\tThis was a valued, uh.

Please!  \n[18]\t\tThaaat's right Dude; they pee on \t\tyour fucking Rug.  \n[19]\t\tWay to go, Dude.  If you will it, it \t\tis no dream.  \n[20]\t\tTheodore Herzel.  \n[21]\t\tState of Israel.  If you will it, \t\tDude, it is no--  \n[22]\t\tHuh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. \t\tCan't leave him home alone or he \t\teats the furniture.  \n[23]\t\tI'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. \t\tI'm looking after it while Cynthia \t\tand Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.  \n[24]\t\tWhat do you mean \"brought it bowling\"? \t\tI didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not \t\tbuying it a fucking beer.  He's not \t\tgonna take your fucking turn, Dude.  He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail.  \n[25]\t\tFirst of all, Dude, you don't have \t\tan ex, secondly, it's a fucking show \t\tdog with fucking papers.  You can't \t\tboard it.  It gets upset, its hair \t\tfalls out.  \n[26]\t\tFucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over \t\tthe line!  Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.  \n[27]\t\tSmokey Huh?  \n[28]\t\tOver the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. \t\tThat's a foul.  \n[29]\t\tExcuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.  \n[30]\t\tThis is not Nam.  This is bowling. \t\tThere are rules.  \n[31]\t\tThis is a league game.  This \t\tdetermines who enters the next round- \t\trobin, am I wrong?  \n[32]\t\tAm I wrong!?  \n[33]\t\tSmokey my friend, you're entering a \t\tworld of pain.  \n[34]\t\tMark that frame an eight, you're \t\tentering a world of pain.  \n[35]\t\tA world of pain.  A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a phone.  \n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\t\tThis is a league game, Smokey!  \n[40]\t\tYou know Dude, I myself dabbled with \t\tpacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, \t\tof course--  \n[41]\t\tYou mean--beyond pacifism?  \n[42]\t\tHuh.  I did not know that.  Well, \t\tit's water under the bridge.  And we \t\tdo enter the next round-robin, am I \t\twrong?  \n[43]\t\tAm I wrong!  \n[44]\t\tOkay then.  We play Quintana and \t\tO'Brien next week.  They'll be \t\tpushovers.  \n[45]\t\tThat's your answer to everything, \t\tDude.  And let me point out--pacifism \t\tis not--look at our current situation \t\twith that camelfucker in Iraq-- \t\tpacifism is not something to hide \t\tbehind.  \n[46]\t\tI'm perfectly calm, Dude.  \n[47]\t\t\t \t\tCalmer than you are.  -his irritates the Dude further.  \n[48]\t\tCalmer than you are.  \n[49]\t\tYeah, but he's a fucking pervert, \t\tDude.  \n[50]\t\tThe man is a sex offender.  With a \t\trecord.  Spent six months in Chino \t\tfor exposing himself to an eight- \t\tyear-old.  \n[51]\t\tWhen he moved down to Venice he had \t\tto go door-to-door to tell everyone \t\the's a pederast.  The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.  \n[52]\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny.  \n[53] They have been joined by Donny.  \n[54]\t\tAnyway.  How much they offer you?  \n[55]\t\tJust for making the hand-off?  \n[56]\t\tWhat if it's during a game?  \n[57]\t\tLife does not stop and start at your \t\tconvenience, you miserable piece of \t\tshit.  \n[58]\t\tHuh?  \n[59]\t\tThat...fucking...bitch!  \n[60]\t\tThat fucking bitch!  \n[61]\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! \t\tVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!  \n[62]\t\tThat's fucking exactly what happened, \t\tDude!  That makes me fucking SICK!  \n[63]\t\tThose rich fucks!  This whole fucking \t\tthing-- I did not watch my buddies \t\tdie face down in the muck so that \t\tthis fucking strumpet--  \n[64]\t\tWell, there isn't a literal \t\tconnection, Dude.  \n[65]\t\tHave it your way.  The point is--  \n[66]\t\tThe fucking point is--  \n[67]\t\tEight-year-olds, Dude.  \n[68]\t\tTake the ringer.  I'll drive.  The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.  \n[69]\t\tThe ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have \t\tthey called yet?  The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling.  \n[70]\t\tMy dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. \t\tThe whites.  \n[71]\t\tThaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. \t\tThe ringer can't look empty.  \n[72]\t\tWell you're right, Dude, I got to \t\tthinking.  I got to thinking why \t\tshould we settle for a measly fucking \t\ttwenty grand--  \n[73]\t\tMy point, Dude, is why should we \t\tsettle for twenty grand when we can \t\tkeep the entire million.  Am I wrong?  \n[74]\t\tIt is a fucking game.  You said so \t\tyourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--  \n[75]\t\tDude, are you fucking this up?  \n[76]\t\tWhat the fuck is going on there?  \n[77]\t\tEasy, Dude.  \n[78]\t\tDude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. \t\tYou're being very unDude.  They'll \t\tcall back.  Look, she kidnapped her--  The phone chirps.  \n[79]\t\tYa see?  Nothing is fucked up here, \t\tDude.  Nothing is fucked.  These \t\tguys are fucking amateurs--  \n[80]\t\t\t \t\tOkay Dude.  Have it your way.  The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.  \n[81]\t\tBut they're amateurs.  The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:  \n[82]\t\tYeah.  So as long as we get her back, \t\tnobody's in a position to complain. \t\tAnd we keep the baksheesh.  \n[83]\t\tThat's the simple part, Dude.  When \t\twe make the handoff, I grab the guy \t\tand beat  it out of him.  He looks at the Dude.  \n[84]\t\t...Huh?  \n[85]\t\tThaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of \t\tthis is its simplicity. If the plan \t\tgets too complex something always \t\tgoes wrong.  If there's one thing I \t\tlearned in Nam--  The phone chirps.  \n[86]\t\tWhat'd he say?  Where's the hand- \t\toff?  \n[87]\t\tHuh?  \n[88]\t\tWe can't do that, Dude.  That fucks \t\tup our plan.  \n[89]\t\tWooden bridge, huh?  \n[90]\t\tThe bridge is coming up!  Gimme the \t\tringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!  \n[91]\t\tOkay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's \t\tthe bridge--  There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to grab the laundry.  And there goes the ringer.  He flings it out the window.  \n[92]\t\tYour wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!  \n[93]\t\tYour wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch \t\tI roll out!  I double back, grab one \t\tof 'em and beat it out of him!  The \t\tuzi!  \n[94]\t\tYou didn't think I was rolling out \t\tof here naked!  \n[95]\t\tFifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's \t\ttake that hill!  Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel.  \n[96]\t\tAhh fuck it, let's go bowling.  \n[97] He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap.  It is ringing.  \n[98]\t\tAitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used \t\tto say.  \n[99]\t\tHuh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't \t\tsee, um-- what exactly is the problem?  The portable phone stops ringing.  \n[100]\t\tWhat the fuck're you talking about? \t\tThat poor woman--that poor slut-- \t\tkidnapped herself, Dude.  You said \t\tso yourself--  \n[101]\t\tThat's right, Dude, 1  % certain--  Donny is trotting excitedly up.  \n[102]\t\tDonny, shut the f--when do we play?  \n[103]\t\tSaturday!  Well they'll have to \t\treschedule.  \n[104]\t\tI told that fuck down at the league \t\toffice-- who's in charge of \t\tscheduling?  \n[105]\t\tI told that kraut a fucking thousand \t\ttimes I don't roll on shabbas.  \n[106]\n[107]\t\tC'mon Dude, eventually she'll get \t\tsick of her little game and, you \t\tknow, wander back--  \n[108]\t\tI'm shomer shabbas.  \n[109]\t\tSaturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of \t\trest.  Means I don't work, I don't \t\tdrive a car, I don't fucking ride in \t\ta car, I don't handle money, I don't \t\tturn on the oven, and I sure as shit \t\tdon't fucking roll!  \n[110]\t\tShomer shabbas.  The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.  \n[111]\t\tFor Christ's sake, Dude.  Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling alley.  Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--  \n[112]\t\tWent alright.  Dude's car got a little \t\tdinged up--  \n[113]\t\tYeah yeah, \"kill that poor woman.\"  He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.  \n[114]\t\tKill that poor woman.  \n[115]\t\tReally, Dude, you surprise me. \t\tThey're not gonna kill shit.  They're \t\tnot gonna do shit.  What can they \t\tdo?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, \t\tlook at the bottom line.  Who's \t\tsitting on a million fucking dollars? \t\tAm I wrong?  \n[116]\t\tWho's got a fucking million fucking \t\tdollars parked in the trunk of our \t\tcar out here?  \n[117]\t\tAnd what do they got, Dude?  My dirty \t\tundies.  My fucking whites--Say, \t\twhere is  the car?  The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space.  \n[118]\t\tWhere's your car, Dude?  \n[119]\t\tHmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped \t\tspot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.  \n[120]\t\tWell, certainly that's a possibility, \t\tDude--  \n[121]\t\tThat wasn't her toe.  \n[122]\t\tHow the fuck should I know?  I do \t\tknow that nothing about it indicates--  \n[123]\t\tFine, Dude.  As if it's impossible \t\tto get some nail polish, apply it to \t\tsomeone else's toe--  \n[124]\t\tYou want a toe?  I can get you a \t\ttoe, believe me.  There are ways, \t\tDude.  You don't wanna know about \t\tit, believe me.  \n[125]\t\tI'll  get  you  a  toe by  this \t\tafternoon--with nail  polish. These \t\tfucking amateurs.   They send us a \t\ttoe, we're  supposed to  shit our- \t\tselves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My \t\tpoint is--  \n[126]\t\tWell that's just, that's the stress \t\ttalking, Dude.  So far we have what \t\tlooks to me like a series of \t\tvictimless crimes--  \n[127]\n[128]\t\tOh, please dear!  I've got news for \t\tyou: the Supreme Court has roundly \t\trejected prior restraint!  \n[129]\t\tLady, I got buddies who died face- \t\tdown in the muck so you and I could \t\tenjoy this family restaurant!  \n[130]\t\tDon't run away from this, Dude! \t\tGoddamnit, this affects all of us!  The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:  \n[131]\t\tOur basic freedoms!  He looks defiantly around.  \n[132]\t\tI'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.  He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, affecting nonchalance.  \n[133]\t\tFinishing my coffee.  \n[134]\t\tOh for Christ--will you shut the \t\tfuck up, Donny.  \n[135]\t\tNow that is ridiculous, Dude.  No \t\tone is going to cut your dick off.  \n[136]\t\tNot if I have anything to say about \t\tit.  \n[137]\t\tDude--  \n[138]\t\tNow Dude--  \n[139]\t\tFucking Germans.  Nothing changes. \t\tFucking Nazis.  \n[140]\t\tCome on, Donny, they were threatening \t\tcastration!  \n[141]\t\tAre you gonna split hairs?  \n[142]\t\tAm I wrong?  \n[143]\t\tHuh?  \n[144]\t\tNihilists!  Jesus.  Walter looks haunted.  Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos.  \n[145]\t\tAnd let's also not forget--let's not \t\tforget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, \t\tan amphibious rodent, for uh, \t\tdomestic, you know, within the city-- \t\tthat isn't legal either.  \n[146]\t\tNo, I'm--  \n[147]\t\t--We're sympathizing here, Dude--  \n[148]\t\tYou gotta buck up, man, you can't go \t\tinto the tournament with this negative \t\tattitude--  \n[149]\t\tFuck the tournament?!  \n[150]\t\tOkay Dude.  I can see you don't want \t\tto be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's \t\tgo get a lane.  They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares  \n[151]\t\tHe lives in North Hollywood on \t\tRadford, near the In-and-Out Burger--  \n[152]\t\tNear the In-and-Out Burger--  \n[153]\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid \t\tis in the ninth grade, Dude, and his \t\tfather is--are you ready for this?-- \t\tArthur Digby Sellers.  \n[154]\t\tHuh?  \n[155]\t\tWho the f--have you ever heard of a \t\tlittle show called Branded, Dude?  \n[156]\t\tAll but one man died?  There at Bitter \t\tCreek?  \n[157]\t\tFucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote \t\t156 episodes, Dude.  \n[158]\t\tThe bulk of the series.  \n[159]\t\tNot exactly a lightweight.  \n[160]\t\tAnd yet his son is a fucking dunce.  \n[161]\t\tYeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out \t\tthere after the, uh, the.  He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.  \n[162]\t\tWhat have you.  We'll, uh--  \n[163]\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, \t\tbrace the kid--he'll be a pushover. \t\tWe'll get that fucking money, if he \t\thasn't spent it already.  Million \t\tfucking clams. And yes, we'll be \t\tnear the, uh--some burgers, some \t\tbeers, a few laughs.  Our fucking \t\ttroubles are over, Dude.  \n[164]\t\tHardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's \t\tstill got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, \t\tdepending on the options.  Wait in \t\tthe car, Donny.  \n[165]\t\tHello, Pilar?  My name is Walter \t\tSobchak, we spoke on the phone, this \t\tis my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.  \n[166]\t\tMay we uh, we wanted to talk about \t\tlittle Larry.  May we come in?  \n[167]\t\tThat's him, Dude.  \n[168]\t\tThank you, ma'am.  He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered voice, to Pilar:  \n[169]\t\tDoes he, uh. . . Is he still writing?  \n[170]\t\tUh-huh.  \n[171]\t\tI just want to say, sir, that we're \t\tboth enormous--on a personal level, \t\tBranded, especially the early \t\tepisodes, has been a source of, uh, \t\tinspir---  There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year- old, looks at the two men.  \n[172]\t\tNo ma'am, I didn't mean to give the \t\timpression that we're police exactly. \t\tWe're hoping that it will not be \t\tnecessary to call the police.  He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:  \n[173]\t\tBut that is up to little Larry here. \t\tIsn't it, Larry?  Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.  \n[174]\t\tIs this your homework, Larry?  Larry does not respond.  \n[175]\t\tIs this your homework, Larry?  \n[176]\t\tDude, please!. . .  Is this your \t\thomework, Larry?  \n[177]\t\tIs this yours, Larry?  Is this your \t\thomework, Larry?  \n[178]\t\tIs this your homework, Larry?  \n[179]\t\tLook, Larry. . . Have you ever heard \t\tof Vietnam?  \n[180]\t\tYou're going to enter a world of \t\tpain, son.  We know that this is \t\tyour homework.  We know you stole a \t\tcar--  \n[181]\t\tAnd the fucking money.  And we know \t\tthat this is your homework, Larry.  No answer.  \n[182]\t\tYou're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.  \n[183]\t\tAh, this is pointless.  As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:  \n[184]\t\tAll right, Plan B.  You might want \t\tto watch out the front window there, \t\tLarry.  He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to follow him.  \n[185]\t\tThis is what happens when you FUCK a \t\tSTRANGER in the ASS, Larry.  \n[186]\t\tFucking language problem, Dude.  He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron.  \n[187]\t\tMaybe he'll understand this.  He is walking over to the Corvette.  \n[188]\n[189]\n[190]\n[191]\n[192]\n[193]\t\tHunh?  The man looks about, wildly.  \n[194]\t\tDude?  \n[195]\t\tI can't drive, Dude, it's erev \t\tshabbas.  \n[196]\t\tErev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm \t\tnot even supposed to pick up the \t\tphone, unless it's an emergency.  \n[197]\t\tI understand.  That's why I picked \t\tup the phone.  \n[198]\t\tDude, I'm not supposed to make calls--  \n[199]\n[200] Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat.  \n[201]\t\tWell it's, sometimes the cathartic, \t\tuh.  \n[202]\t\tWhat's your point, Dude?  \n[203]\t\tYeah?  \n[204]\t\tOkay, but how does all this add up \t\tto an emergency?  \n[205]\t\tI'm saying, I see what you're getting \t\tat, Dude, he kept the money, but my \t\tpoint is, here we are, it's shabbas, \t\tthe sabbath, which I'm allowed to \t\tbreak only if it's a matter of life \t\tand death--  \n[206]\t\tWhat the fuck are you talking about?  \n[207]\t\tWhat the fuck are you talking about? \t\tI converted when I married Cynthia! \t\tCome on, Dude!  \n[208]\t\tYou know this!  \n[209]\t\tYeah?  What do you think happens \t\twhen you get divorced?  You turn in \t\tyour library card?  Get a new driver's \t\tlicense?  Stop being Jewish?  \n[210]\t\tI'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye  \n[211]\t\tThree thousand years of beautiful \t\ttradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- \n[212]\t\tJesus Christ.  \n[213]\t\tJesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped \t\ther.  \n[214]\t\tWho'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!  \n[215]\n[216]\t\tI'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy \t\twho's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY \n[217]\n[218]\t\tLook at that fucking phony, Dude! \t\tPretending to be a fucking \t\tmillionaire!  \n[219]\t\tLet me tell you something else. \t\tI've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, \t\tand this guy is a fake.  A fucking \t\tgoldbricker.  He is crossing to Lebowski.  \n[220]\t\tThis guy fucking walks.  I've never \t\tbeen more certain of anything in my \t\tlife!  \n[221]\t\tWalk, you fucking phony!  The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps and yaps.  \n[222]\t\tIt's all over, man!  We call your \t\tfucking bluff!  \n[223]\n[224]\t\tSure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! \n[225]\t\tOh, shit.  \n[226]\t\tOh, shit.  \n[227]\t\tYeah, I can see that, Dude.  \n[228]\t\tShit, sorry man.  \n[229]\t\tShit, Dude, I didn't know.  I \t\twouldn't've done it if I knew he was \t\ta fucking crybaby.  \n[230]\t\tShit.  He didn't look like a spinal.  \n[231] Each with a beer at the scoring table.  \n[232]\t\tSure you'll see some tank battles. \t\tBut fighting in desert is very \t\tdifferent from fighting in canopy \t\tjungle.  \n[233]\t\tI mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war \t\twhereas, uh, this thing should be a \t\tfucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an \t\tM16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking \t\ttank.  Just me and Charlie, man, \t\teyeball to eyeball.  \n[234]\t\tThat's fuckin' combat.  The man in \t\tthe black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy \t\tfuckin' adversary.  \n[235]\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch \t\tof fig-eaters with towels on their \t\theads tryin' to find reverse on a \t\tSoviet tank.  This is not a worthy--  \n[236]\t\tHe's cracking.  \n[237]\t\tA tree of life, Dude.  To all who \t\tcling to it.  They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming from a boom box.  \n[238]\t\tThey're nihilists, Donny, nothing to \t\tbe afraid of.  The Germans stop conferring.  \n[239]\t\tFuck you.  Fuck the three of you.  \n[240]\t\tThere's no ransom if you don't have \t\ta fucking hostage.  That's what ransom \t\tis.  Those are the fucking rules.  \n[241]\n[242]\t\tFair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST \n[243]\n[244] \n[245]\t\tThey won't hurt us, Donny.  These \t\tmen are cowards.  \n[246]\t\tFuck you.  The Dude is digging into his pocket.  \n[247]\t\tWhat's mine is mine.  \n[248]\t\t\t \t\tWhat's mine is mine.  With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.  \n[249]\t\t\t \t\tCome and get it.  \n[250]\t\tCome and get it.  Fucking nihilist.  \n[251]\t\tShow me what you got.  Nihilist. \t\tDipshit with a nine-toed woman.  In a rage, Dieter charges.  \n[252] hurls his leather satchel.  \n[253] twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes on Dieter's ear.  \n[254] His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.  Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped.  \n[255] still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and Dieter's separate.  \n[256] draws back his fist.  \n[257]\n[258]\t\tWe've got a man down, Dude.  With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.  The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.  \n[259]\t\tNo Dude.  \n[260]\t\tThere weren't any shots.  \n[261]\t\tIt's a heart attack.  \n[262]\t\tCall the medics, Dude.  \n[263]\t\tHurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping \t\tblood.  Might pass out.  The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder.  \n[264]\t\tRest easy, good buddy, you're doing \t\tfine.  We got help choppering in.  \n[265] ---  They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.  A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.  \n[266]\t\tWalter Sobchak.  \n[267]\t\tYeah.  \n[268]\t\tYeah.  He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence. The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards Donnelly, pointing.  \n[269]\t\tWhat's this?  \n[270]\t\tDon't need it.  We're scattering the \t\tashes.  \n[271]\t\tThis is a hundred and eighty dollars.  \n[272]\t\tA hundred and eighty dollars?!  \n[273]\t\tYeah, but we're--  \n[274]\t\tWe're scattering the fucking ashes!  \n[275]\n[276]\n[277]\t\tI'll say a few words.  The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears his throat.  \n[278]\t\tDonny was a good bowler, and a good \t\tman.  He was. . . He was one of us. \t\tHe was a man who loved the outdoors, \t\tand bowling, and as a surfer explored \t\tthe beaches of southern California \t\tfrom Redondo to Calabassos.  And he \t\twas an avid bowler.  And a good \t\tfriend.  He died--he died as so many \t\tof his generation, before his time. \t\tIn your wisdom you took him, Lord. \t\tAs you took so many bright flowering \t\tyoung men, at Khe San and Lan Doc \t\tand Hill 364.  These young men gave \t\ttheir lives.  And Donny too.  Donny \t\twho. . . who loved bowling.  Walter clears his throat.  \n[279]\t\tAnd so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, \t\tin accordance with what we think \t\tyour dying wishes might well have \t\tbeen, we commit your mortal remains \t\tto the bosom of.  Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.  \n[280]\t\tthe Pacific Ocean, which you loved \t\tso well.  \n[281]\t\tGoodnight, sweet prince.  The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.  \n[282]\t\tShit, I'm sorry Dude.  He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.  \n[283]\t\tGoddamn wind.  Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping Walter's hands away.  \n[284]\t\tDude!  Dude, I'm sorry!  The Dude is near tears.  \n[285]\t\tDude, I'm--it was an accident!  The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.  \n[286]\t\tDude, I'm sorry--  \n[287]\t\tShit Dude, I'm sorry--  \n[288]\t\tAwww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.  \n[289] We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before. They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his bowling shirt.  ", "Sobchak": "", "Brandt": "\n[1]\t\tHow was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?  \n[2]\t\tManolo will load it into your car \t\tfor you, uh, Dude.  \n[3]\t\tWell, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see \t\tyou again some time, Dude.  \n[4]\t\tOur guest has to be getting along, \t\tMrs.  Lebowski.  The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman.  \n[5]\t\tHa-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very \t\tfree-spirited.  We're all very fond \t\tof her.  \n[6]\t\tHa-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.  He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his  \n[7]\t\tWe've had some terrible news.  Mr. \t\tLebowski is in seclusion in the West \t\tWing.  \n[8] \n[9]\t\tMr. Lebowski.  Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.  \n[10]\t\tMr. Lebowski is prepared to make a \t\tgenerous offer to you to act as \t\tcourier once we get instructions for \t\tthe money.  \n[11]\t\tHe suspects that the culprits might \t\tbe the very people who, uh, soiled \t\tyour rug, and you're in a unique \t\tposition to confirm or, uh, disconfirm \t\tthat suspicion.  \n[12]\t\tWell Dude, we just don't know.  \n[13]\t\tThey called about eighty minutes \t\tago.  They want you to take the money \t\tand drive north on the 4 5.  They'll \t\tcall you on the portable phone with \t\tinstructions in about forty minutes. \t\tOne person only or I'd go with you. \t\tThey were very clear on that: one \t\tperson only.  What happened to your \t\tjaw?  \n[14]\t\tHere's the money, and the phone. \t\tPlease, Dude, follow whatever \t\tinstructions they give.  \n[15]\t\tHer life is in your hands.  \n[16]\t\tMr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: \t\tHer life is in your hands.  \n[17]\t\tHer life is in your hands, Dude. \t\tAnd report back to us as soon as \t\tit's done.  \n[18]\t\tWe've been frantically trying to \t\treach you, Dude.  Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.  \n[19]\t\tThis is our concern, Dude.  \n[20]\t\tThat had not occurred to us, Dude.  \n[21]\t\tWe received it this morning.  The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it.  \n[22]\t\tHe can't see you, Dude.  We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its tail.  \n[23]\t\tVisiting friends of hers in Palm \t\tSprings.  Just picked up and left, \t\tnever bothered to tell us.  \n[24]\t\tWho's this gentleman, Dude?  \n[25]\t\tYou shouldn't go in there, Dude! \t\tHe's very angry!  BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--  "}}
