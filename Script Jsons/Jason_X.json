Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick \t\tsome little punk ass.  \tKkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.  \n[4]\t\tBack to the shuttle! All of you! \t\tI'll find them.  \n[5]\t\tWe don't have time for this shit.  \tAs they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and \tsqueeze together.

I don't think you \t\tshould open that door.  \n[7]\t\tWe're outta here!  \tYllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of \tblood and -CRACK-breaks it off.  \n[8]\t\tDon't touch that!  \tGas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.  \n[9]\t\tDefense droids. I'm on it.  \tKicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.   \n[10]\t\tThey're only class two. I can \t\thandle this. No problem.  \n[11]\t\tStand back!  \tHe pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.  \n[12]\t\t\t\tCome on!  \tKicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids \tfollow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear \taround the bend - towards the exit.  \tA beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view.

I'll hold 'em off! \t\tTeach, find a way out!  \n[14]\t\tSorry kid, leave this to the pros.  \n[15]\t\tLeave him behind!  \n[16]\t\tThen duck.  \tCHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.  \tKABLOOM!!

This is . . .  \tThe NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of \tNano-Technology.  \tAzrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into \taction as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.  \n[10]\t\tAnother hour and I'd have lost \t\tthe arm.  \n[11]\t\tI better get extra credit for this shit.  \n[12]\t\tDon't I deserve a sick day or some \t\tshit like that?  \tYllo exits. \n[13]\t\tYou got lucky.  \n[14]\t\tSpeaking of which, duck!  \tDallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it \tlunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet, \ttake aim, when --  \n[15]\t\tWhat the?!  \n[16]\t\tPause play.  \tSuddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to \tDallas and Azrael.  \n[17]\t\tHey cool. They brought ancient \t\thockey guy back to life.  \tJason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched \twhistle.  \tWhy aren't they running.  \n[18]\t\tHey! We're playing a game here. \t\tGet off the court!  \tJason raises his silver blade high.  \n[19]\t\tAsshole that does not count as a kill.  \n[20]\t\tOh, come on!  \tJASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. \tThe head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.  \n[21]\t\tAlright, asshole.  \tThe sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.  \tJason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, \tsterile.  \tNo creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan \troom we see a small tinted glass.  \tAzrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.  \n[22]\t\tClear off the court, asshole.  \n[23]\t\tYeah yeah I better call the labs, \t\tsee what the hell is going on.  \tJason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\tLab...this is AZ in the game grid. \t\tYour guy got out and runined our game.  \n[25]\t\t\t \t\tI said the guy in the mask is in here \t\truining our game.  \tJason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.  \n[26]\t\t\t \t\tSend someone to the grid to pick \t\thim up. He looks lost.  \n[27]\t\t\t \t\tAll right fine, we'll head back--  \tSuddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.  ", "Dallas": "\n[1]\t\tPunk?  \tDallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.  \n[2]\t\tThat's nine to four, geek-boy.  \n[3]\t\tYou got lucky. I could have waited until he \t\tate your head.  \n[4]\t\tHe's good.  \tAzrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. \tAliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in \tunloading on the hulinking terror.  \tTHeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.  \n[5]\t\tThat sucks. Why won't he go down?  \n[6]\t\tHe's not part of the program.  \n[7]\t\tNo, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...  \tSLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his \trib cage. Blood spurts \tas his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, \tonly pissed.  \n[8]\t\tYes it does.  \n[9]\t\tOkay, enough of this shit.  \n[10]\t\tI don't have all day, kid.  \n[11]\t\tJesus!  \tThe sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.  \tWhen Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's \tinsides.  \tIN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.  \n[12]\t\t\t \t\tSarge! Get the fuck down here! \t\tWe got a real shitstorm in the --  \tDALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself \tinto combat mode...BUT...  \tJASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.  \tIt flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat \tto his chair.  \tThe blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to \tblack.

He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and \tleaps \tthrough the hole in the celing.  \n[24]\t\tNow that's just gross.  \n[25]\t\tI'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.  \tCrutch comes to a fork in the walkway.  \n[26]\t\tI got a brand new pair of \t\troller-skates, you got a brand new key...  \n[27]\t\tThere's not enough time.  \tRizzo catches up.  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\tYou know what you get if you shove \t\ttwo bananas up your ass?

A \tlaser cannon is \tmounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from \taround the lab. \tSinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --  \n[45]\t\tDo I have to?  \n[46]\t\tOh, alright.  \n[47] \tWe see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal \tscan. \tOne the display we see:  \n[48]\t\tCome on, boy. Let's see if we can \t\topen up  can'a whoop ass!  \tBRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.  \n[49]\t\tDon't worry about me. I live for this shit.  \tAnd with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall \twith the laser \tcannon.  \n[50]\t\tShe's the Yellow Rose of Taegu, \t\tthe girl that I adore. Her cunt \t\tit smells like cock juice; she's \t\ta good two-dollar whore. You may \t\ttalk to me of Seoul girls or whores \t\tfrom Tokyo, but the yellow rose of \t\tTaegu beats them all, I'd you know.  \n[51]\t\t\t \t\tShe was a young and charming girl; \t\ther age was scarce sixteen.  \tJASON rushes KAY-EM 14!  \n[52]\t\tShe took me in and she kicked out \t\ta sailor and marine.  \n[53]\t\tShe had no titties on her chest; \t\tthat didn't bother me,  \n[54]\t\tFor what she had between her legs \t\twas big enough for three.  \n[55]\t\tWhy you low life, scum sucking, \t\trat dick blowing, sum bitch. \t\tYour mamma must'a had some huge balls.  \tOf course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.  \tJason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. \tGlass, formaldehyde and specimens \train down on top of them.  \tHaving lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and \tOVER. He \tcatches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.  \n[56]\t\t\t \t\tThat was very good. You should \t\tfeel very good about yourself \t\tright now. Good effort. \t\t\t \t\tHow could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!  \tKay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.  \n[57]\t\tOkay, dip shit. Time to finish \t\tyou off so I can go home and boink \t\tyour momma with a corndog.

The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.  \n[59] \tThis time, Jason's body doesn't move.  \n[60]\t\tOh...my...god. What have I done? \t\t\t \t\tThorgan!  \tKay-Em turns and races down the hall.  \n[61]\t\tThorgan I'm a murderer!  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\tSumbitch won't be giving us \t\tanymore trouble.  \n[63]\t\t\t \t\tBlew half his skull away, one leg, \t\tone arm and left his entrails \t\tstretched across the lab. And look \t\tat me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!  \n[64]\t\tA real mamma's boy that one. \t\tDissed his mamma and he nearly \t\tthrew a tantrum. Little good it did him.  \n[65]\t\tNo, fuck me.  \tThe door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.  \tBut he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now \tSHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is \n[66]\t\tYeeee-haw!!!!  \n[67]\t\tThat's the best you can do?  \tJason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her \thead \tfrom her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.  \n[68]\t\tIs that it? Come back and fight like a man!  \n[69]\t\tI think I'm going to throw up...  \n[70]\t\tOh, goody. I'm so pleased. \t\tI'd clap if I could.  \tBoeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.  \n[71]\t\tYou must shut down the engines.  \n[72]\t\tIt was my pleasure, my love. \t\tPerhaps if all works for the best \t\tyou can rebuild me and we can try that \t\tdoggie style thing again.  \n[73]\t\t\t \t\tI get no kick from champaign, mere \t\talcohol doesn't faze me at all, \t\tbut I get a kick out of you.  \n[74]\t\tUh-oh. That's not a part of the program. \t\tThorgan, we've got a problem!  \n[75] \tAS it skitters across the floor --  \n[76]\t\tAhhhhh!  \t-- and right out the air lock  \n[77]\t\tHello? A little assistance here?  \tThey turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her \tand pulls \ther head into his arms.  \n[78]\t\tI am now.

She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of \ttranquillizer \tand a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive \tdosage. Enough to \tbring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?  \tShe starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay. \tSurely she's not that stupid.  \n[45]\t\tDamnit! You scared the hell out of me!  \n[46]\t\tJason. He's what happened. Then \t\tGrendel hit Space Lab.  \n[47]\t\tYllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.  \n[48] \tLights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino \tsyringe \tinto his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there \tstaring \tat her.  \n[49]\t\tWell go on! Pass out!  \tJason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.  \n[50]\t\tShit.  \tJason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.  \n[51]\t\tHe....He...  \n[52]\t\tHe came for me, I had to run!  \n[53]\t\tI...I don't know what I did...  \n[54]\t\tHe was chasing me!  \n[55]\t\tI don't know...sorry?  \n[56]\t\tThey're not gonna make it. Close the door \t\tbefore he gets us all.  \n[57]\t\tClose the fucking door!  \n[58]\t\tPull me in!  ", "Sgt.": "", "Brodski": "\n[1]\t\tYllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass \t\tback to the shuttle!!  \n[2]\t\tKicker! Get them the hell out of there!  \tJanessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a \tflat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.  \tKicker grabs Yllo.  \n[3]\t\tWhat the hell were you thinking?  \tYLLO ignores him, turns to his team.  \n[4]\t\tNot so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.  \tThe E-X Grunts step in front of kids.  \n[5]\t\tMy god! This is way over your head, pal. \t\tWe need to call some experts and . . .  \n[6]\t\tYou're a teacher.  \n[7]\t\tWhat if they're carrying? Did you even check?  \n[8]\t\tThorgan!!  \n[9]\t\tHow do you know that piece of cursed rock down \t\tthere doesn't carry something metal tits can't \t\tdetect?  \n[10]\t\tDamnit, Yllo! I don't like it.  \n[11]\t\tI still think we should send for a team of \t\treal scientists.  \n[12]\t\tRight now, I care only for the safety of this \t\tcrew. You don't know anything about these two -  \tThe stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.  \n[13]\t\tJesus what the hell is that?  \n[14]\t\tMy job.  \n[15]\t\tI like her already.  \n[16]\t\tGive it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.  \n[17]\t\tI'm with you kid.  \n[18]\t\t\t \t\tLab two, relax. What's the matter? \t\tHe's dead.  \n[19]\t\tJesus, God!  \n[20]\t\tDallas! That you? Come back!  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tDallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?  \tNothing. Finally...  \n[22]\t\tKicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell \t\tme what the hell is going on!  \tShe gets up and heads for the door.  \n[23]\t\tI doubt that. I think we can handle whatever \t\tyour ancient hockey player can throw at us.  \n[24]\t\t\t \t\tDead?  \n[25]\t\tReport to weapons. We're going \t\ton a hunt.  \n[26]\t\tYllo, what's your head count?  \n[27]\t\tThis place should be safe. Get them \t\tback here. I don't want to be hunting \t\taround and kill one of your kids by accident. \t\tAs much as I've dreamed of doing that.  \tBrodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.  \n[28]\t\tI need to know what you know about this guy.  \n[29]\t\tNot an option. I'm going to hunt this \t\tson of a bitch down.  \tRizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.  \n[30]\t\tI've been a grunt for fifteen years. \t\tThere's not a problem I can't fix with \t\tenough ammunition.  \tYllo is getting no response.  \n[31]\t\tNot a chance.  \n[32]\t\tYou got that right.  \tThey arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.  \n[33]\t\tYou sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! \t\tIf that...that thing is out there, it's \t\tdead! You got it!!!  \n[34]\t\tNow get out of our way...get back to the \t\tlab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... \t\twe've got a job to do!  \n[35]\t\tGot it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to \t\tLab two and cover out backs.  \n[36]\t\tI'll try.  \n[37]\t\tAlright, the teach requests we take this guy \t\tout at the knees. I say shoot to kill.  \tThe boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.  \n[38]\t\tSo after you've killed him, put one in his knee \t\tso we can say we tried.  \tThe men LAUGH and high five.  \n[39]\t\tGo to infrared, stay in radio contact. \t\t\t \t\tTeach you there?  \n[40]\t\tYou just keep an eye out.  \n[41]\t\tLet's move out.  \tThe doors HISS open.  \n[42]\t\tTwo teams, Port, starboard.  \tThey split up.  \n[43]\t\tKicker, anything?  \n[44]\t\tBriggs, Geko, talk to me!  \n[45] \n[46]\t\tDAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!  \n[47]\t\tTeach! Where the hell are you?! \t\tWhere's our visuals?!!  \n[48]\t\twHAT'S My status?! I've lost three \t\tmen and your worthless fuck! After I \t\tkill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!  \n[49] \tAs he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer \tnowhere to be seen.  \n[50]\t\tKicker? Where are you?  \tElsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!  \n[51]\t\tFind Crutch! Set up an ion field \t\taround the cargo bay. We'll torch \t\tthe sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!  \tBrodski races toward the Cargo exit.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\tWhat?  \tYllo considers then. \n[53]\t\tWhere is everybody? What happened?  \n[54]\t\tGive me a break! What happened?  \n[55]\t\tSpace Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands \t\ton Yllo.  \n[56]\t\tTakes more than a steelbalde to take \t\tthis old dog down.  \n[57]\t\tYup, that ought'a do it.  \tJason turns on Janessa.  \tShe stands frozen in fear.  \tJason raises his machete and --  \n[58]\t\t\t \t\tHe-help me...  \tHe holds his hand out to her. Then--  \n[59]\t\tYou stupid bitch!  \tEveryone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame. \tHe's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his \tmid-section.  \n[60]\t\tDamnit to hell, you left me back there to die!  \n[61]\t\tYeah, yeah. \t\t\t \t\tWell, what have you got to say for yourself?  \n[62]\t\tBomb?  \n[63]\t\tHow much you need?  \n[64]\t\tBlowing the walkway? You come up \t\twith that yourself?  \n[65]\t\tKid, you ever thought about the marine corp?  \tDelongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.  \n[66]\t\tWell fuck me.  \n[67]\t\tDamage?  \tBoeman climbs to a console.  \n[68]\t\tI'm pulling, damnit!  \tBut Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the \tSergeant's \tgrasp.  \tShe flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.  \tShe flies toward the hole, slams into it.  \tEverything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then \t--  \n[69]\t\tWell, that's a shame.  \n[70]\t\tWe need weapons.  \n[71]\t\tCan't shut em' down from here.  \n[72]\t\tI'll go.  \tThe kids give him the \"are you crazy?\" stare.  \n[73]\t\tGet out of here!  \tSERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.  \tThe door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.  \n[74]\t\tThat all you got?!!  \tJason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, \tthe tough \told leather neck is silent for good.  \n[75] \tStill barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back. \tHe turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.  \tJason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.  \n[76]\t\tYeee---Haaaaa!!  \tSlowly they begin entering the atmosphere.  \tImmediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good \tman...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.  \tSpread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his \tdescent.  \tHis fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up. \tIt begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.  \tFlames build as he rockets towards Earth II.  \tFlesh BUBBLES and OOZES.  \tHis legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his \tbody!
