With friendly eyes. \n[4]And sweet breath. \n[5]Smile lines, my lady. \n[6]I beg your majesty's forgiveness. \n[7]The puddle man is outside, majesty.  \n[8]He's rather sweet. \n[9]Well, wouldn't you? \n[10]I did very little, sir. You'd already caught the Queen's eye. \n[11]Him, my lady? \n[12]The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court, I hope. \n[13]If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment - \n[14]That can only mean the Queen. \n[15]It seems you've presumed after all. \n[16]Tell me what it is you really want. \n[17]In that order? \n[18]It seems rather a long way round. \n[19]Which you will no doubt name after yourself. \n[20]Of course. \n[21]Why should I tell you that, sir? \n[22]My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible. All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement. Pay her the compliment of truth. \n[23]Elizabeth Throckmorton. \n[24]Everyone calls me Bess. \n[25]He is certainly charming, my lady. \n[26]He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams of building a shining city. \n[27]It's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court. \n[28]Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour? \n[29]I expect I'll think of something. \n[30]   \n[31]George! What's wrong? Is your father alright? \n[32]I was worried. You must send me no more letters. You know what would happen if I was caught. \n[33]Do you need more money? \n[34]You are known Papists. \n[35]I cannot betray the Queen. \n[36]Don't put me in danger like this. \n[37]I'm sorry. \n[38]Majesty? \n[39]I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady. \n[40]No doubt, my lady. \n[41]Yes, my lady. \n[42]Yes - \n[43]The Queen asks me to assure you - \n[44]That is unfair - \n[45]Let me speak! \n[46]The Queen shouts at you once, and you sulk like a child. I thought you more of a man than that. And I thought you a better friend to the Queen. Her every move is watched by a hundred eyes. Assassins plot to kill her. Enemies prepare to overwhelm her country. And you say she's playing games? \n[47] \n[48]Oh! It's you! \n[49]My prayer's done. \n[50]And I thought I prayed in silence. \n[51]A man was hanged today. A Papist. I knew him well. He was my cousin. He died because I gave information. I gave information to prove my loyalty. Because I was afraid. \n[52]He told me he wanted to change. Become part of the new England. I was afraid that he was lying to me. But what if - what if it was true? \n[53] \n[54]I thought so. \n[55]\n[56]Please! I'm innocent! I've always been a loyal servant of the Queen. I'd never betray the Queen, never - \n[57]She plotted to kill you. \n[58]So do we all. \n[59]She'll go on lying til you cut out her traitor's heart. \n[60]I used to be quieter, majesty. \n[61]Thank God you've come. I've never seen her so distressed. She's been alone in her rooms since morning. She'll see no one. \n[62]No. But she needs you. I know she does. \n[63]I'll be quick. I have something to tell you. But I ask for nothing. Is that understood? Your life is your own. Nothing will change. \n[64]I'm - \n[65]No one knows. My plans are made. I shall ask the Queen for permission to leave court. I shall live quietly in the country with - with my child. The Queen must know nothing. \n[66]To my mother's house. \n[67]I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't court a man without her permission. I can't marry without her permission. As for having a child - \n[68]As soon as I'm allowed. \n[69]Hush! We've no choice. You know it as well as I do. \n[70]Please listen. You once said to me, `Whatever I have to give, ask and it's yours.' Do you remember? \n[71]I ask that you forget me. Go to your ship. Do your duty. Forget me. \n[72]Here, my lady! \n[73]Yes, my lady. \n[74]Yes, my lady. It is - my husband's child. \n[75]156                                                                156    ", "Throckmorton": "\n[1]He's old. He won't live long now.

Please. \n[6]Here's my noble jailer, come to smack my hand. \n[7]Have I sinned again, sir? \n[8]Oh, you jailer.

On whose orders? \n[18]Do stop snivelling. \n[19]The Warden? My Warden? \n[20]What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do you want me to go about naked? \n[21]How am I to send my intimate letters? \n[22]And you will read them. \n[23]Am I to have no privacy? \n[24]You disappoint me, sir. \n[25]The Queen! Am I not a Queen too? What if I wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so starved of lovers that she must feed on mine? \n[26]Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? \n[27]They say she's a beautiful woman. Is she so very beautiful? \n[28]She's called the virgin queen. Why is that, sir? Can it be that no man will have her? \n[29]My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not? \n[30]I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison.

By what authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is my only judge. Raise your law above God's law, and what law remains?
