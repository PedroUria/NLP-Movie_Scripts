I've \t          owned a lot of cars. Different \t          kinds. Lots of different kinds of \t          cars. She was standing, this girl, \t          on the side of the street where \t          there was a chicken stand; not the \t          Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless \t          a chicken stand, and I pulled the \t          Mercury over and rolled down the \t          window by electric power. She was \t          wearing a leather skirt and she had \t          a lot of hair on her arms. I like \t          that. I like it a lot. It means a \t          big bush. I like a big bush. She \t          said, \"Are you dating?\" I said, \t          \"yes,\" and she got in the car. We \t          pulled to a remote location, one \t          that she and I both felt \t          comfortable with and she said, \"How \t          much can you spend?\" I said, \"What \t          it takes to see your bush. I know \t          it's a big one.\" She said \"twenty \t          five dollars,\" which to a working \t          man is not chicken feed. I produced \t          the money and she put it in her \t          shoe and pulled up her skirt. There \t          before me lay a thin, crooked, \t          uncircumcised penis. You can \t          imagine how badly I wanted my \t          twenty-five dollars back. \t \n[2]\t          There was a young man named John \t          Liggit Hunter who was in the \t          filling station business and a good \t          filling station business. He was \t          one of those young men that we run \t          across so often in life. I'm sure \t          you've run across them, that didn't \t          deserve the things he had. One of \t          those things was his beautiful \t          bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia \t          Peach. As a matter of fact she \t          looked more like the picture I've \t          had in my head than any woman I've \t          ever seen. I took it upon myself to \t          take her away from John Liggit \t          Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm \t          not sure if I mentioned that he was \t          a Frenchman who claimed to be an \t          Englishman. It took some very \t          strong nylon cord to take her away \t          from him. She was a fighter as well \t          as a Georgia Peach. \t \n[3]\t \t          A shovel just makes too goddamn \t          much racket. \t \n[4]\t          You have to make something explode \t          to truly understand it. You have to \t          examine the tiny particles while \t          they're on fire. \t \tOff screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and \tsee MELVIN the guard. \t \n[5]\t \tHe's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull \tback and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital \tagain with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl \tis now wearing the hospital issue clothing. \t \n[6]\t          ... on the third day I washed her. \t          She wasn't very clean. I got all \t          the right spots. She was the first \t          one I ever kept for any length of \t          time, you see I get bored easily, I \t          have a short attention span. I \t          can't say she enjoyed her stay, \t          although the washcloth in her mouth \t          held in place by good duct tape \t          kept any complaints to a minimum. I \t          don't really like people who talk a \t          lot. I like to do the talking. I \t          guess that's why I'm so fond of \t          you. You're so easygoing, although \t          I do sense a little tension in you \t          sometimes. By the way, how was it \t          out there? Did you have any fun? \t          Make any new acquaintances? Tell me \t          what it was like. \t \n[7]\t          I bet you did. I was never bent \t          that way. I'm bent the other way. \t          So, you liked it out there in the \t          world. \t \n[8]\t          Well, it's not too big in here, is \t          it? \t \t          I feel very generous today. I feel \t          like listening. I'm sure you have \t          plenty to tell me. And please bore \t          me with the details. \t               ) \t          Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was \t          it the boy? \t ", "Bushman": "", "Melvin": "\n[1]\t          Karl, I gotta take you down to the \t          old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has \t          some people for you to see down \t          there. Come on. Let's go. \t \n[2]\t          No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't. \t \tTheresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light \tit. \t \n[3]\t          You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry. \t ", "Karl": "\n[1]\t          Well, I reckon what you're a \t          wanting to know is what I'm doing \t          in here. I reckon the reason I'm in \t          here is 'cause I killed somebody. \t          But I reckon what you was a wanting \t          to know is how come me to kill \t          somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start \t          at the front and tell you. \t \t          I lived most of my life out behind \t          my mother and father's house in a \t          little old shed and my daddy'd \t          built for me. They didn't too much \t          want me up there in the house with \t          the rest of 'em. I mostly just set \t          around out there in the shed all \t          the time a lookin' at the ground. \t          It didn't have no floor but I had \t          me a hole dug out to lay down in \t          and a quilt or tow that I put down \t          there. \t \t          My daddy was a hard workin' man \t          most of his life, not that I can \t          say the same fer myself. I most \t          just set around the shed and \t          tinkered around with a lawn mower \t          or two and went to school off and \t          on from time to time but the \t          children there made quite a bit of \t          sport of me, made fun of me quite a \t          bit. Some of 'em roughed me up \t          sometimes so mostly I stayed out \t          back there in the shed. My daddy \t          worked down at the sawmill there, \t          down there at the planer mill for \t          an old man named Dixon. \t          Old man Dixon was a very cruel \t          feller, he didn't treat his \t          employees very well, didn't pay 'em \t          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy \t          much of a wage, just barely enough \t          to get by on. But I reckon he got \t          by all right, they come out one or \t          the other of 'em, usually my \t          mother, and fed me pretty regular. \t          At least I know he made enough for \t          me to have mustard and biscuits \t          three or four times a week. Old man \t          Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon. \t          Jesse was really more cruel than \t          his daddy. He made quite a bit of \t          sport of me and takened advantage \t          of the little girls around the \t          neighborhood quite a bit. \t \t          He used to say my mother was a very \t          pretty woman. He said it quite a \t          bit from time to time, when I was \t          at the school house. Well, I reckon \t          you want me to get on and tell you \t          what happened so I reckon I'll tell \t          you. I was settin' out in the shed \t          one evenin' not doin' too much, \t          just kindly starin' at the wall and \t          a waitin' fer my mother to come out \t          and give me my Bible lesson and I \t          heared a commotion up in the house \t          there so I got up and run up on the \t          screened-in porch there to see what \t          was a goin' on, and I looked in the \t          kitchen window and I seen my mother \t          a layin' there on the floor without \t          any clothes on. \t \t          And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on \t          top of her having his way with her. \t \t          Well, I just seen red. I picked up \t          a kaiser blade that was a layin' \t          there by the screen door, some \t          folks calls it a sling blade, I \t          call it a kaiser blade. It's just a \t          long handle like a axe handle with \t          a long blade on it that's shaped \t          kind of like a banana. Sharp on one \t          edge and dull on the other. It's \t          what the highway boys use to cut \t          down weeds and whatnot. \t          I went in the kitchen there and I \t          hit Jesse Dixon up side the head \t          with it and knocked him off my \t          mother. I reckon that didn't quite \t          satisfy me so I hit him again in \t          the neck with the sharp edge and \t          just plumb near cut his head off. \t          Killed him. Well, my mother, she \t          jumped up from there and started \t          yellin', \"What did you kill Jesse \t          fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?\" \t \t          Well, come to find out my mother \t          didn't really mind what Jesse was a \t          doin' to her. I reckon that made me \t          madder than what Jesse had made me. \t          I takened the kaiser blade, some \t          folks calls it a sling blade, I \t          call it a kaiser blade and hit my \t          mother up side the head with it an' \t          killed her. \t \t          Some folks has asked me if I had it \t          to do over again would I do the \t          same thing. I don't know, I reckon \t          I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to \t          put me in here and here I've been \t          for a great long while. I've \t          learned to read some; took me four \t          years to read the Bible. I reckon I \t          understand a good deal of it. It \t          wasn't what I expected in a lot of \t          places. I've slept in a good bed \t          for a great long while. They've \t          seen fit to put me out now. They \t          tell me they're a settin' me free \t          today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all \t          you need to know. If you want any \t          more details I reckon I can tell \t          'em to you. I don't know if that's \t          enough for your newspaper or not. \t \tSuddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness. \t \n[2]\t \t          I don't reckon I got no reason to \t          kill nobody. \t \n[3]\t \t          Thank you. \t \n[4]\t          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used \t          to looking at pretty people. \t \n[5]\t          I reckon I'm gonna have to get used \t          to them lookin' at me, too. \t \n[6]\t          I ain't got nothing but them books. \t \n[7]\t          All right then. \t \tKarl walks slowly down the hallway. \t \n[8]\t          I was kindly wantin' somethin' or \t          'nother d'eat. \t \n[9]\t          You have any biscuits for sale? \t \n[10]\t          What you got that's good to eat? \t \n[11]\t          What do you like to eat here? \t \n[12]\t          French-fried potaters. \t \n[13]\t          How much you want fer 'em? I'll get \t          some of them I reckon. \t \n[14]\t          Give me the big'uns. \t \tKarl digs in his pocket for money. \t \n[15]\t          What you got in there, warshing? \t \n[16]\t          Ain't you got no mama and daddy to \t          tend to it? \t \n[17]\t          How fer you going with them sacks \t          full of warsh? \t \n[18]\t          I'll help you tote 'em if I don't \t          give out first. \t \n[19]\t          Karl's my name. \t \n[20]\t          Childers. \t \n[21]\t          Different ones. One's the Bible. \t          One of 'ems a book on Christmas. \t          One of 'ems how to be a carpenter. \t \n[22]\t          Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down. \t \n[23]\t          I did live there in the state \t          hospital. \t \n[24]\t          I killed some folks quite awhile \t          back. They said I wadn't right in \t          the head and they put me in there \t          in the nervous hospital instead of \t          puttin' me in jail. \t \n[25]\t          Yeah. \t \n[26]\t          They told me I was well. They had \t          to turn me loose. \t \n[27]\t          I reckon I feel all right. \t \n[28]\t          I never was much count at it. I \t          never did get picked out fer it. \t \n[29]\t          How does a feller go about gettin' \t          up to the state hospital? \t \n[30]\t          All right then. \t \n[31]\t          I want to come back and stay here. \t \n[32]\t          I reckon I don't care nothin' about \t          bein' a free man. I don't know how \t          to go about it. \t \n[33]\t          Naw. \t \n[34]\t          Naw. Never did know too much of \t          nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway. \t \n[35]\t          I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn \t          mowers and whatnot. \t \n[36]\t          I reckon. \t \n[37]\t          I never was no good with history. \t \n[38]\t          I reckon I can just walk around \t          till the mornin'. Or set and read \t          me a book somewhere. \t \tThey sit and stare at each other for a moment. \t \n[39]\t          No thank ye. \t \n[40]\t          I don't reckon I know nobody name \t          Jerry. \t \n[41]\t          He's a-carryin' me to look fer work \t          in Millsburg where I was borned. \t \n[42]\t          Coffee makes me a might nervous \t          when I drink it. \t \n[43]\t          Yes sir. \t \tWoolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the \tedge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed \tstill as it was the night before. \t \n[44]\t          Yes sir. \t \n[45]\t          Thank ye. \t \n[46]\t          I've tinkered around on 'em a \t          little bit. \t \n[47]\t          I like them french-fried potaters. \t \n[48]\t          I don't reckon. \t \n[49]\t          Yeah, they's good all right. \t \n[50]\t          They give me fifty dollars when \t          they turned me loose. I spent up \t          some of it on ridin' the bus and \t          eatin' french-fried potaters. \t \n[51]\t          All right then. \t \n[52]\t          Yeah it is. Your name's Frank. \t \n[53]\t          You told me to come by. \t \n[54]\t          I ain't no good at it. I just come \t          by. \t \n[55]\t          All right then. \t \tHe starts to walk away. \t \n[56]\t          I don't want to worry your mama \t          with company. \t \n[57]\t          I was kindly needin' to do some \t          tradin'. Reckon they sell \t          toothpaste? \t \n[58]\t \t          Pleased to know y'all. \t \tThere's an uncomfortable silence. \t \n[59]\t          Naw, I don't believe you have. I \t          don't reckon I never been in here. \t          This store didn't used to be here. \t \n[60]\t          I's horned and raised here up till \t          I's twelve year old. \t \n[61]\t          What's that you say? \t \n[62]\t          They turned me loose from the state \t          hospital. \t \n[63]\t          I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired \t          on to work for Bill Cox's outfit. \t \n[64]\t          Not really to speak of. \t \tLinda and Frank return from the back. \t \n[65]\t          Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough \t          to scrape by on, I reckon. \t \n[66]\t          My mother's dead. My daddy's \t          s'posed to be around still. He \t          don't want to have nothin' to do \t          with me though. \t \n[67]\t          He never did want to. I figure he \t          ain't changed his mind much. \t \n[68]\t \t          You don't need to know all of that. \t          You're just a boy. \t          You need to think about good \t          thoughts while you're still a boy. \t          They'll be plenty of time for the \t          other. \t \n[69]\t          How come her to keep bein' \t          girlfriends and all with him if \t          he's mean to her? \t \n[70]\t          Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me \t          that. \t \n[71]\t          Why did he do that, reckon. \t \n[72]\t          Yeah, I did. \t \n[73]\t          Two people. \t \n[74]\t          I thought they was. \t \n[75]\t          I growed up and got taught it ain't \t          right to kill nobody. \t \n[76]\t          That boy wants me to. \t \n[77]\t          I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty \t          good. \t \n[78]\t          Yes sir. \t \n[79]\t          That boy wants me to. \t \n[80]\t          Naw, I ain't. \t \n[81]\t          Quite a spell, I reckon. \t \n[82]\t          I done et just a little bit ago. \t \n[83]\t          I reckon I can stand to eat a \t          little somethin' or 'nother at \t          noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox \t          generally gets me a box of french \t          fried potaters. But I reckon he can \t          lay off doin' it tomorrow. \t \n[84]\t          Tolerable, I reckon. \t \n[85]\t          This and that. Toothpaste and \t          whatnot. \t \n[86]\t          Different ones. The Bible's one of \t          'em. \t \n[87]\t          A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't \t          understand all of it. \t \n[88]\t          I ain't never used no hatchet that \t          I remember. \t \n[89]\t          You ort not to talk that way. \t          You're just a boy. \t \n[90]\t          He ort not to talk that away to you \t          neither. He ain't no count. He's \t          mean to you and your mama. \t \t          Yore mama and that feller that's \t          carryin' me to get somethin' \t          d'eat's gonna be back here \t          directly. \t \n[91]\t          I reckon if you want me to. \t \t          I got some of that potted meat and \t          sodie crackers left over if you \t          want some. \t \n[92]\t          I reckon it tastes pretty good to \t          me. \t \n[93]\t          I like the way you talk. \t \tKarl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight \tas we: \t \n[94]\t          I reckon not. \t \n[95]\t          Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer. \t \n[96]\t          I've heard it said that way. \t \n[97]\t          I wouldn't never hurt them. \t \n[98]\t          I was thinkin' I could use me \t          another helpin' of these potaters. \t \n[99]\t          Before that I was thinkin' it'd be \t          good if I could get another three \t          or four cans of that potted meat if \t          you got any extry. \t \n[100]\t          Childers. \t \n[101]\t          I reckon. \t \tWe hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near \tdistance. \t \n[102]\t          No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me \t          nervous when I drink it. \t \n[103]\t          I didn't aim to. \t \n[104]\t          No ma'am. \t \tKarl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring. \t \n[105]\t          Two fellers was on a bridge a \t          takin' a leak and one feller says \t          the water was cold and the other \t          said it was deep water. One of 'em \t          came from Arkansas, I believe. \t \n[106]\t          Do you reckon you can make me some \t          biscuits? \t \n[107]\t          Just whenever you take a notion to. \t          I don't aim to put you out. \t \n[108]\t          Yes ma'am. \t \n[109]\t          Mustard's good on 'em to me. \t \n[110]\t          Thank ye. \t \n[111]\t          I wouldn't mind a havin' supper. \t \n[112]\t          I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me \t          and him's made friends. \t \tShe keeps working. \t \n[113]\t          Hit ain't right for me to keep from \t          tellin' you how come me to be put \t          in the state hospital. \t \n[114]\t          I killed my mother and a old boy \t          name Jesse Dixon. I thought they \t          was a-doin' wrong. I was about your \t          boy's age. They say I'm well now \t          from it. \t \tLinda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but \tnot as much as you would think. \t \n[115]\t          Yes ma'am. \t \t          I like your garage. \t \t          I wouldn't never hurt you or your \t          boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible \t          and say the same thing. \t \n[116]\t          Yes sir. \t \n[117]\t          My history. \t \n[118]\t          I told 'em about it. They know I'm \t          well. That Mizz Wheatley made me \t          some biscuits. \t \n[119]\t          That boy, he's my friend. He likes \t          the way I talk and I like the way \t          he talks. \t \n[120]\t          Hit ain't got no gas in it. \t \n[121]\t          I reckon. \t \n[122]\t          I ain't read 'em yet except two or \t          three of 'em. I can't understand a \t          lot of what I try to read. My mind, \t          hit wonders off to somethin' else \t          when I try to read. \t \n[123]\t          Yes ma'am, I reckon. \t \n[124]\t          I like walkin' quite a bit from \t          time to time. \t \n[125]\t          All right then. \t \tHe gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up \tand tries to catch up. \t \n[126]\t          I reckon. \t \tThey walk a little farther in silence. \t \n[127]\t          I ain't really thought about it too \t          much I don't reckon. \t \tThey walk until they disappear into the darkness. \t \n[128]\t          Thank ye. \t \n[129]\t          A blister shore can hurt. \t \n[130]\t          Flowers is pretty. I've always \t          thought that. \t \n[131]\t          Yeah. \t \n[132]\t          That gal that made employee of the \t          month give 'em to me for awalkin' \t          with her. \t \n[133]\t          Naw. You can look at all my books \t          you want to. \t \n[134]\t          That's than un on Christmas I was \t          tellin' you about. \t \n[135]\t          Yeah. \t \n[136]\t          All right then. \t \n[137]\t          Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like \t          to tore me up when I read about \t          that pore little cripple boy. \t \n[138]\t          Hit was right thoughty of her. \t \n[139]\t          All right then. \t \n[140]\t          Yeah, I recollect it. \t \n[141]\t          If you want me to. \t \n[142]\t          I bet he will. I got a little money \t          if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. \t \n[143]\t          They ort to. You're a good boy. \t \n[144]\t          Naw. \t \n[145]\t          That's real good. You ort not to if \t          ye ain't married to somebody. Bible \t          tells you that much. Hit tells some \t          things that don't seem right too, I \t          reckon. I guess a feller ort to \t          foller it close as he can, though. \t \t          You don't touch yourself, do you? \t \n[146]\t          Pull on your works. Your privates. \t \n[147]\t          Yes sir. You ort not know that \t          language. \t \n[148]\t          You ort not to pull on yourself \t          that away. \t \n[149]\t          He ain't no count. \t \n[150]\t          I don't reckon I know. \t \n[151]\t          Naw. \t \n[152]\t          I had one there for little bit. Hit \t          didn't get old enough to play with. \t \n[153]\t          Yeah. \t \n[154]\t          Hit was borned a little too early \t          on. My mother and father made hit \t          come too early some way or other. I \t          reckon they changed their mind \t          about havin' another'n. I was about \t          six or eight year old then and they \t          didn't care too much for me so I \t          reckon they didn't need somethin' \t          else to worry 'em with. \t \n[155]\t          My daddy come to the shed out back \t          and got me and said throw this here \t          away and handed me a towel with \t          somethin' in it. I went for the \t          trash barrel there and opened up \t          the towel to see 'cause they was a \t          noise and somethin' movin' in it. \t          Hit was bloody-like around that \t          towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty \t          baby, no bigger than a squirrel. \t \n[156]\t          Yes sir. Right then it was. \t \n[157]\t          A little ol' boy. \t \n[158]\t          I didn't feel right about doin' \t          that. I takened a shoe box from \t          there in the shed and emptied out \t          some screwdrivers and nuts and \t          warshers from it and put the little \t          feller in that and buried him in \t          the corner of the yard there. That \t          seemed more proper to me, I reckon. \t \n[159]\t          I heared it cryin' a little through \t          that box. \t \n[160]\t          I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon \t          I didn't know what to do. I didn't \t          know how to care for no baby. Mama \t          and Daddy didn't want him. They \t          learned me to do what they told me \t          to. These days I figure it might of \t          been best to give him right back to \t          the Good Lord right off the bat \t          anyhow. \t \n[161]\t          Hits been hard thinkin' about it. \t          They ain't a day goes by I don't \t          think about it. I kindly have a \t          picture of it up in my head that I \t          see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have \t          bad thoughts on it. I wished they \t          was somethin' I could of did, too. \t          Shouldn't no bad things happen to \t          childern. All the ol' bad things \t          ort to be saved up for folks that's \t          growed up, the way I see it. I \t          shouldn't of told you about that. A \t          boy ort not hear about such things. \t          It just kindly come out. \t \n[162]\t          I've studied about it. The Bible \t          says not to or you end up goin' to \t          Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I \t          call it Hades. \t \n[163]\t          Yes sir, I reckon it does. \t \n[164]\t          No ma'am. \t \n[165]\t          I reckon. \t \n[166]\t          I could shore use some. Thank ye. \t \n[167]\t          Readin' on this book on how to work \t          carpentry. I aim to learn how to \t          build things out of wood one of \t          these times. I've always been \t          partial to wood buildin's and \t          cabinets and whatnot. These \t          drawin's they got here don't make \t          no sense to me so far. \t              (he looks directly at \t               Frank, which he seldom \t               does \t          You seem like yore tails a'draggin' \t          a might. You got somethin' wrong \t          with ye? \t \n[168]\t          I don't reckon I know. I ain't \t          found no way yet and I'm three or \t          four times as old as you. Might be \t          that's just the way folks is. \t \n[169]\t          Make believin' always made me feel \t          good too from time to time. \t \tThey sit in silence for a moment. \t \n[170]\t          Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for \t          a Mister Turner tomorrow and a \t          closin' up shop early. \t \n[171]\t          I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if \t          neither one of us is no count it \t          won't make no difference. \t \n[172]\t          Yeah. \t \n[173]\t          Yessir. \t \n[174]\t          I dern near had me a touchdown till \t          them boys got a-hold of me there so \t          I figured I better give it off to \t          you. I seen you over there \t          follerin' me. \t \n[175]\t          Them boys was tryin' to pull me \t          down pretty hard. \t \n[176]\t          No sir. \t \n[177]\t          I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' \t          else just like you told me I'd do. \t \n[178]\t          If I ain't too stove up. I ain't \t          like you. I'm old and give out. \t \t          I'm proud of ye. \t \n[179]\t          I'm ye boy. \t \n[180]\t          I'm ye oldest boy name Karl. \t \n[181]\t          They turned me aloose from the \t          nervous hospital. Said I was well. \t \tNo response. \t \n[182]\t          I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox \t          fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot. \t \tNo response. \t \n[183]\t          That grass out in the yard's all \t          growed up. I figured I might cut it \t          fer ye. \t \n[184]\t          I learned to read some. I've read \t          on the Bible quite a bit. I don't \t          understand all of it, but I believe \t          I understand a good deal of it. \t          Them stories Mama and you told me \t          ain't in there. You ort not to of \t          done that to ye boy. \t \t          I've studied on killin' you. But I \t          don't reckon they's no reason fer \t          it if all you're gonna do is set \t          there in that chair. You'll be dead \t          soon enough I reckon and the \t          world'll be shut of ye. \t              (Karl walks toward the \t               kitchen and turns back to \t               the old man \t          You ort not to of killed my \t          brother.

The Bible says two men ort \t          not lay together. But I'll bet you \t          the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody \t          like you to Hades.

I need the police over \t          here at the Wheatley house. \t \t          I've killed somebody with a mower \t          blade. \t \t          Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I \t          hit him two good whacks. That \t          second time just plumb near cut his \t          head in two. \t \t          Hits a little old yeller house \t          right on the corner of Marigold \t          Street and some other street. \t          They's a red pickup truck out front \t          says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION \t          on it. I'll be a settin' here \t          waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the \t          police, Doyle said you might want \t          to send a ambulance or a hearse. \t          Thank ye. \t \tHe hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar \tof mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the \tkitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering \tup some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the \tmustard jar and runs the knife around it. \tThere's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the \tbiscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law. \t \n[219]\t          They was a boy.

Vaughan doesn't really know \texactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a \tmoment, Frank answers the door. \t \n[23]\t          Sure, I guess. \t \n[24]\t          I know Albert. We're friends. \t \n[25]\t          That's ridiculous. That's just a \t          total lie. \t \n[26]\t \t          Yeah, I knew that. You're a card \t          all right. \t \tLinda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave. \t \n[27]\t          Okay, Karl, the reason I brought \t          you here was to talk to you about \t          something that is on my mind. \t              (pauses for a response, \t               instead Karl eats french \t               fries and stares at the \t               table \t          I guess I'll put it right out on \t          the table. Where do I start. Linda \t          and Frank are very important to me. \t          They're like family. My own family \t          was never like family. They're \t          horrible people. As a matter of \t          fact I prayed every night for years \t          that my father would die. I finally \t          realized through a lot of therapy \t          that I was wasting my energy on \t          hating him. Now I just don't care. \t \t          You see, you and I are a lot alike, \t          strange as that may seem. I mean \t          not physically or even mentally \t          really, just well, maybe \t          emotionally or actually the hand \t          we've been dealt in life. We're \t          different. People see us as being \t          different anyway. You're -- well \t          you have your affliction or \t          whatever and I, well mine's not as \t          easy to see. I'm just going to say \t          it. I'm gay. \t \t          Does that surprise you? \t \t          That I'm gay. You know what being \t          gay is, don't you? \t \n[28]\t          Homosexual. I like men. Sexually. \t \n[29]\t          Well that's a very offensive way to \t          put it. You shouldn't say that. You \t          were taught that, weren't you? \t \n[30]\t          Anyway, it's hard to live gay, \t          that's the right way to say it, in \t          a small town like this. I've wanted \t          to leave many times, but my love \t          for Linda and Frank and another \t          certain person that we won't go \t          into have kept me from it. Anyway, \t          I'm rambling. If you're going to \t          live in the Wheatly garage you need \t          to know that it won't be easy. \t          Doyle is a monster. Not just a \t          closed minded redneck, but a \t          monster. A dangerous person. I've \t          told Linda that one day that man is \t          going to really hurt her or that \t          boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I \t          see it in his eyes. I'm very in \t          tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle \t          will make your life hell. You're a \t          perfect target. When I first saw \t          you I was afraid of you. Not really \t          afraid, I guess, just taken aback. \t          But also, I felt a real sensitive \t          feeling from you. And for some \t          reason, Frank has adopted you. Much \t          like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I \t          didn't mean it like that. In a good \t          way. Anyway, I just want you to \t          know what you're in for. I have a \t          good feeling about you. You're good \t          for Frank. Maybe it's that he can \t          have an adult friend on a child's \t          level. \t          I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a \t          bad way. \t \t          There's one more thing. It's none \t          of my business why you were in the \t          state hospital. Everyone has \t          something in their past, maybe you \t          tried suicide, maybe you did \t          something -- terrible. But what I \t          see before me is a gentle, simple \t          man. All I want you to promise me \t          is that you're capable of being \t          around Linda and Frank. You know. \t          You would never hurt them under any \t          circumstances, would you? \t \n[31]\t          That's what I thought. I hope I \t          haven't offended you in any way. \t          You seem like a thinker. You seem \t          to always be in deep thought. Tell \t          me something. What are you thinking \t          right now? \t \tKarl looks up and stares for a moment. \t \n[32]\t          Oh. How about before that? \t \n[33]\t          Sure. It sounded like a number one \t          tune all right. \t \n[34]\t          I'd better go on home now, it's \t          late. I have to work tomorrow. \t \n[35]\t          Are you sure you can drive? You've \t          really had a lot of alcohol. \t \n[36]\t          Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled. \t \n[37]\t          What exactly do you mean by that? I \t          don't understand. \t \n[38]\t          I don't get it. \t \n[39]\t          I don't really understand the \t          meaning of the words. \t \n[40]\t          It's not your house, Doyle, it's \t          Linda's. \t \n[41]\t          Doyle, don't you lay one hand on \t          her. \t \n[42]\t          I'm a witness. I heard you threaten \t          her life. \t \n[43]\t \tVaughan, ALBERT the \"friend,\" Linda, Frank, Karl, and \tMELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl \tand Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly \tpicks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat. \tThis goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns \tto Karl. \t \n[44]\t          I think Karl is going to be a \t          writer or a librarian eventually. \t          You should see all the books he \t          has. He must read constantly. \t \n[45]\t          Does everyone like the food? \t \tNods and yeses. \t \n[46]\t          Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm \t          a good cook. \t \n[47]\t          Karl, maybe you and Melinda might \t          want to take a walk or something \t          after dinner. It's a nice night. \t \n[48]\t          I'm sorry. \t \n[49]\t          Or the kind old ladies who work in \t          the school cafeteria wear. \t \n[50]\t          Listen everybody, I know this may \t          sound corny, I've had a few glasses \t          of wine and that kind of makes me a \t          little emotional, but I'm going to \t          say it anyway. It just came over me \t          in a rush. I want you all to know \t          that I care about each and every \t          one of you at this table. \t \n[51]\t          Also, Melinda, please don't tell \t          anybody at the store that Albert \t          was here tonight, okay. \t \n[52]\t          Well, a lot of people in town talk \t          and spread cruel rumors. \t          Unfortunately, I have to keep \t          certain parts of my life private. \t \n[53]\t          Yes. \t \n[54]\t \tKarl knocks on the door. After a moment, Vaughan answers in a \tpair of big shorts and a sweatshirt. \t \n[55]\t          Karl, what are you doing here? Come \t          in. \t \n[56]\t          Okay. \t \n[57]\t          What's wrong? Is everything okay? \t \n[58]\t          Well, sure, okay.

You didn't want to \t          go anywhere, did you? \t \n[16]\t          If it works out and all, maybe \t          we'll get you a key so you can get \t          out at night if you need to. See \t          you later. \t \tThey leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He \tsets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a \tmoment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again. \t \n[17]\t          Scooter, did I tell about the two \t          old boys pissin' off the bridge? \t \n[18]\t          There was these two old boys hung \t          their peckers off of a bridge to \t          piss, one old boy from California \t          and one old boy from Arkansas. \t          Old boy from California says, \"Boy \t          this water's cold.\" Old boy from \t          Arkansas says \"Yeah, and it's deep \t          too.\" \t \t          Get it? That's a goodun. \t \n[19]\t          Well, yeah it's a classic. You \t          know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about \t          it last night and it's just not \t          Christian of me to not let you have \t          a key. I mean you been in lockup so \t          long, you don't need me keepin' you \t          locked up. You need to come and go \t          as you please. Here, take this key, \t          it'll get you in and out that back \t          door. \t              (Karl takes the key and \t               keeps eating french \t               fries \t          Them french fries good? \t \n[20]\t          You got any money? \t \n[21]\t          Well, I'm gonna pay you today for \t          this comin' week, so you'll have \t          some walkin' around money. When you \t          get off this evenin' you better go \t          buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up \t          supplies to have back there. Some \t          hard candy and some magazines. \t          Somethin' to keep you busy at \t          night. \t \n[22]\t          I'll let you off while it's still \t          daylight. \t \n[23]\t          Now, Karl, you sure you want to go \t          stay with these folks? You're \t          welcome to keep on stayin here. \t          It's workin' out real good. \t \n[24]\t          All right then. I'll see you bright \t          and early. How you comin' along on \t          that garden tiller? \t \n[25]\t          You done fixed it? I'll be damned. \t          Scooter told me it couldn't be \t          fixed. \t          'Course Scooter's about as shitless \t          as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. \t          You done fixed it. I'll just be \t          damned. See you tomorrow. \t \n[26]\t          How 'bout you, Jerry. \t \n[27]\t          Doin' pretty good. Got a sick \t          tiller here. What's got you down \t          this way? \t \n[28]\t          Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for \t          them rackets and breathin' things \t          he does. Ain't threatened me with a \t          killin' or anything. \t \t          But boy you couldn't of been more \t          right about him fixin' things. That \t          son of a bitch is a regular Eli \t          Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves \t          french fries. Eats four larges and \t          don't even so much as belch. I'm \t          proud to have him. \t \n[29]\t          He's gone to stayin' over with that \t          Wheatley boy and his mama in their \t          garage. I think that little boy \t          adopted him damn near like a \t          mascot. But he's got a key here to \t          come and go as he pleases. \t          Everything's worked out good. \t \n[30]\t          Sure. \t \tBill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on \tnew mowers in the front window. \t \n[31]\t          Scooter! Run get Karl for me. \t \n[32]\t          Karl, see if you can figure out \t          what's wrong with this thing. It \t          won't crank up and ever'thing seems \t          to be put together right. \t \tKarl squats beside the tiller. \t \n[33]\t          Okay, stop back by. Don't worry \t          about your boy here, he's doin' \t          good. \t \tKarl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap. \t \n[34]\t          See there. Thinks of the simplest \t          thing first. \t \n[35]\t          Hey Karl, they's somebody out here \t          to see you. Some gal holding a nice \t          bouquet. \t \t          Come on now, she wants to talk to \t          you. Don't just set there. \t \tKarl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter. \tMelinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a \tcellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody \tsays anything for a moment. \t \n[36]\t          Scooter, let's me and you go over \t          to Dairy Queen and pick up a few \t          things for lunchtime. \t \n[37]\t          Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon \t          my language, ma'am. \t \tThey start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at \tKarl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the \tcounter. They are silent for a while. \t \n[38]\t          Hey there Karl, can you come unload \t          a generator for me? \t \tKarl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside. \t \n[39]\t          Karl, lift this thing down and \t          carry it to the back. It's on the \t          blink. \t              (to man as Karl unloads \t               it \t          We'll have it for you in a day or \t          two, Walter. \t \n[40]\t          Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a \t          bulldozier. Fix anything, too. \t \t          He's mentally retarded, but he's a \t          whiz on small engines. Lord works \t          in mysterious ways. \t \tKarl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and \twatches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The \tman playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles \this hair. \t ", "Cox": "\n[1]\t \tKarl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they \tare ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. Bill Cox \tappears in the door. \t \n[2]\t \tKarl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel. \t ", "Frank": "\n[1]\t          What's you last name? \t \n[2]\t          What are all them books? \t \n[3]\t          How come you're carryin' them \t          around with you. \t \n[4]\t          Don't you live somewhere? \t \n[5]\t          Why'd you live there? \t \n[6]\t          They let you out? \t \n[7]\t          How come? \t \n[8]\t          Are you well? \t \n[9]\t          You don't seem like you'd kill \t          nobody. \t \tThey reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up \tthe sidewalk. \t \n[10]\t          This is my house. You can just set \t          those bags on the porch. \t \tKarl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each \tother in silence for a moment. \t \n[11]\t          Do you like to play football? \t \n[12]\t          Me and the Burnett twins and some \t          boys plays down at the junior high \t          practice field all the time. If you \t          ever want to come by and play. We \t          ain't no good either. Well, I'll \t          see you later. \t \tHe goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door. \t \n[13]\t          Hey there. I thought I heard \t          somebody on the porch. Wasn't your \t          name Karl? \t \n[14]\t          Yeah. What you doin' by here? \t \n[15]\t          Did you want to play ball with us? \t \n[16]\t          Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to \t          go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar \t          Store. She's workin' two till \t          eight. \t \n[17]\t          Wait a minute. You want to go with \t          me? You can meet my mama. \t \n[18]\t          Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's \t          real nice. She'll give us somethin' \t          if we ask her to. Candy or \t          somethin'. \t \n[19]\t          They sell some of everything. Come \t          on let's go. I won't tell her about \t          you bein' in the state hospital for \t          killin'. \t \n[20]\t          Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan. \t \n[21]\t          Yeah. \t \n[22]\t          I don't like potted meat. Daddy \t          used to say it was made out of lips \t          and peckers and intestints. \t \n[23]\t          Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the \t          laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. \t          And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. \t          He lets mama off any time she feels \t          like it 'cause they're best \t          friends. \t \n[24]\t          Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you \t          can stay with us. Out in the \t          garage. Our car won't fit in there \t          anyway. It's real neat. \t \n[25]\t          Can we get some candy and pops? \t \n[26]\t          This is what I call my secret place \t          'cause I come out here when I feel \t          like bein' by myself. I used to \t          come here with Karen Cross. She's \t          kind of like my girlfriend, or used \t          to be. She says she likes Jerry \t          Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her \t          back 'cause I love her. We used to \t          come here and hold hands and talk \t          and read books to each other with a \t          flashlight. She didn't want to have \t          anything to do with me in front of \t          other people 'cause I don't have \t          any money. Well, mama and me, I \t          mean. She seemed to like me a whole \t          lot when we were out here though. \t          She said she loved me, too. Out \t          here. Settin' right on that stump \t          you're on. See, her daddy's a \t          dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry \t          Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice \t          plant. Was your folks well off? \t \n[27]\t          They still around, your folks? \t \n[28]\t          How do you know? \t \n[29]\t          How did your mama die? \t \n[30]\t          I've had a lot of bad thoughts \t          since my daddy died. Sometimes I \t          wish I was still real little and he \t          was still here. My mama's real \t          good, but I wish I had both of 'em. \t \t          When we went to Memphis one time in \t          the car, it was rainin' so hard we \t          couldn't see the road. But I wadn't \t          scared because I thought as long as \t          daddy was drivin' nothin' could \t          happen to us. I feel that way about \t          mama now. \t              (he looks at the ground \t               for a moment \t          Mama has a boyfriend now. His name \t          is Doyle Hargraves. He works \t          construction so he makes a pretty \t          good livin'. He still don't help \t          mama out with any money though. He \t          ain't no good. He's mean to her. He \t          don't like me at all. Mama says \t          it's because he's jealous I belong \t          to my daddy instead of him. He \t          stays with us all night sometimes, \t          but he's got his own house. \t          Somebody told me it's so he can \t          still have other girlfriends. I \t          like it on the nights when he ain't \t          at our house. I'm not so nervous \t          then. \t \n[31]\t          She says it's for the times when \t          he's good to her. She's lonely \t          since daddy died. She said \t          sometimes she don't know why. \t \t          He threatened to kill her if she \t          ever left him. My daddy would kill \t          him if he was here and somebody was \t          mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real \t          good to mama. Vaughan that you met. \t          But he's not able to do anything to \t          Doyle, he's funny you know. Not \t          funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes \t          to go with men instead of women. \t          That makes him not to be able to \t          fight too good. He sure is nice \t          though. He's from St. Louis. People \t          who are queer can get along better \t          in a big town. He got transferred \t          here to work. But mama said the \t          real reason he left is 'cause his \t          daddy hated him. For bein' the way \t          he is. I wish he liked to go with \t          women. I'd rather him be mama's \t          boyfriend than Doyle. \t \tPause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled. \t \n[32]\t          Karl. \t \t          You know when I said daddy got hit \t          by a train. \t \n[33]\t          It ain't the truth. He shot hisself \t          with a shotgun on purpose. \t \n[34]\t          'Cause he didn't have enough money \t          to take care of us the way he \t          wanted to. That's what the letter \t          said. He got laid off from work and \t          had to just work odd jobs. I \t          thought he took care of us fine. \t \t          Karl, did you really kill somebody? \t \n[35]\t          Who did you kill? \t \n[36]\t          Were they bad people? \t \n[37]\t          Maybe they needed it. \t \n[38]\t          It's okay if you're lookin' out for \t          yourself. If it's self-defense. Was \t          it self-defense? \t \tKarl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and \tdoesn't answer. \t \n[39]\t          My daddy was good. I think too many \t          good people die. It ain't right. \t          That's what I think. \t \n[40]\t          He's real honest. He wouldn't steal \t          nothin'. \t \n[41]\t          No sir. \t \n[42]\t          I ain't sure. \t \n[43]\t          I want to watch T.V. \t \n[44]\t          Hey. Y'all come on in. \t \n[45]\t          Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl \t          got things we need to do. \t \n[46]\t          Come on, Karl, let's go out to the \t          garage. \t \n[47]\t          Stop it, Doyle! \t \n[48]\t          Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about \t          daddy, you hear me! \t \n[49]\t          Come on, Karl. \t \tThey get up and walk away. \t \n[50]\t          I'd like to kill that son of a \t          bitch. I hate him. \t \n[51]\t          Well, I hate him. \t \n[52]\t          Will you stay here with us for a \t          long time? \t \n[53]\t          I don't see how you can eat that \t          stuff with all those insides it's \t          made out of. \t \n[54]\t          I like the way you talk. \t \n[55]\t          I don't know. He just said he'd eat \t          out there. \t \n[56]\t          I sure like the way he talks. It \t          sounds like a race car motor \t          idlin'. It makes me not be nervous. \t \n[57]\t          I get nervous, that's all I know. \t \tThey eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where \tthis conversation could lead and know when to leave well \tenough alone. \t \n[58]\t          Last time you got mad and run \t          Morris and them off and said to \t          stay away from here. \t \n[59]\t          They ain't even no good. The only \t          one can play is Randy \t          Horsefeathers. He claims he's an \t          Indian. His real name's Randy \t          Collins and he works at the feed \t          mill. He can at least play guitar. \t \n[60]\t          He ain't ever okay to me. \t \tThe garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really \thappy. \t \n[61]\t          I hate you! \t \n[62]\t          You all right, Mama? \t \n[63]\t          We don't need to think bad \t          thoughts, do we Mama? \t \n[64]\t          Did Vaughan go home? \t \n[65]\t          Did Karl go to bed? \t \n[66]\t          I bet he don't. Karl likes me. \t \n[67]\t          Mama? \t \n[68]\t          Is everything gonna be all right \t          someday? I just stay nervous all \t          the time just about. \t \n[69]\t          Doyle wouldn't really kill you, \t          would he? \t \n[70]\t          I love you, too, Mama. \t \tHe goes to his room. \t \n[71]\t          I just don't have anything to say \t          about shoes. \t \tSilence for a moment. \t \n[72]\t          Hey Karl, you off work? \t \n[73]\t          Where'd you get them flowers? \t \n[74]\t          I was goin' to the secret place. I \t          borried one of your books to take \t          down there. You ain't mad, are you? \t \n[75]\t          It's name's A Christmas Carol. \t \n[76]\t          You want to go with me? \t \n[77]\t          I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a \t          while. \t \n[78]\t          Boy, folks sure had it rough back a \t          long time ago, didn't they? \t \n[79]\t          Yeah, me too. \t \t          That was nice of that woman to give \t          you them flowers. \t \n[80]\t          I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. \t \n[81]\t          You know that girl I told you \t          about. The one I love. \t \n[82]\t          Would you go see her with me? I \t          kind of thought I might take her \t          some flowers like that woman done \t          you. \t \n[83]\t          I ain't got no money to get 'em \t          with but I bet Vaughan will let me \t          have some of them flowers at the \t          store. \t \n[84]\t          I usually get run off by her mama \t          or daddy if they're home. Reckon \t          why they don't like me? \t \n[85]\t          Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean \t          I don't love her. \t \n[86]\t          And I don't try to touch her. You \t          know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, \t          sex and all. \t \n[87]\t          What do you mean? \t \n[88]\t          Oh, jackin' off? \t \n[89]\t          I didn't know till here while back \t          a year or two ago when I spent the \t          night with Ronnie Smart one time. \t          He said just tug on your peter and \t          think about your mama. I tried it, \t          but I felt funny thinkin' about my \t          mama. So, I switched over to \t          thinkin' about his mama and then \t          what he told me would happen, \t          happened. It sure tingles, don't \t          it? \t \n[90]\t          I kind of like you tellin' me what \t          to do and not to do. Just like my \t          daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' \t          me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to \t          do. Mama said the only way to ever \t          get away from him is for him to get \t          away from us. That we can't leave \t          him or he'll try and hurt her. \t \n[91]\t          You don't seem like a daddy. You \t          seem like a brother. \t \t          Wonder what makes you like somebody \t          right off when you don't even know \t          'em like what happened with me and \t          you. \t \n[92]\t          And then some people you don't like \t          right off. It's funny. \t \t          You know why I want you to play \t          ball with me? \t \n[93]\t          'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if \t          you ain't no good. It takes your \t          mind off of everything else while \t          you're doin' it. When you run real \t          fast tryin' to make a touchdown you \t          don't think about anything else. I \t          ain't no good, but my daddy always \t          said he was proud of me when I \t          threw a ball or ran with it. Did \t          you have any brothers and sisters \t          growin' up to play with? \t \n[94]\t          Why not? It died? \t \n[95]\t          Why? \t \n[96]\t          So it died when it come out? \t \n[97]\t          It was alive? \t \n[98]\t          A boy or girl? \t \n[99]\t          You threw it in a trash barrel? \t \n[100]\t          It was still alive when you buried \t          it? \t \n[101]\t          That don't seem right. It seems \t          like you should have kept him alive \t          and took care of him if he was your \t          brother. \t \n[102]\t          That makes me feel real sad. \t          Couldn't you have done somethin', \t          Karl? I would have. I wish I would \t          of had him. He'd be here right now. \t          Livin'. \t \n[103]\t          I didn't mean to say anything bad \t          about you. I know you're good. You \t          didn't mean no harm. \t \t          Did you ever think about killin' \t          yourself on purpose like my daddy \t          did? \t \n[104]\t          Bible says the same thing about \t          killin' others, too. \t \n[105]\t          I always get nervous when I hear \t          that doorbell. I'm okay just \t          walkin' over, but somethin' about \t          that dang doorbell. They have one \t          room where you can't walk on the \t          carpet or sit on the furniture. I \t          don't see much sense in havin' it. \t \tThe door opens and we see an older black lady, the \n[106]\t          Ma'am, I really want to give them \t          to Karen. \t \n[107]\t          Will you get her for me. Please. I \t          really want to see her. \t          She'll want to see me, too, 'cause \t          we're not in public. Just don't \t          tell her folks I'm here. \t \n[108]\t          I wanted to bring you some flowers. \t          They're pretty good ones. \t \n[109]\t          I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. \t          He's my new friend. But I feel like \t          I've always known him. I thought \t          you should meet him. \t \n[110]\t          He's gonna be around a lot and I \t          hope you are too, so... \t \n[111]\t          Can you go there with us now? Me \t          and Karl. We could just hang out. \t          Karl has some cool books. \t \n[112]\t          But maybe just for awhile -- \t \n[113]\t          She said she'd see me later. That's \t          kinda good, right? \t \n[114]\t          He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do \t          better. \t \n[115]\t          We've had a real hard life, too, \t          Mama. \t \tLinda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank. \t \n[116]\t          What you readin'? \t \n[117]\t          Seems like Doyle's wormed his way \t          back in. Mama said he's stayin' \t          over tonight and he's talkin' about \t          movin' in for good. We ain't ever \t          gonna be happy. We'll always be \t          nervous, won't we Karl? \t \n[118]\t          I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. \t          I just make like to myself she \t          loves me. I know better, though. It \t          just feels good to me when I \t          imagine it. \t \n[119]\t          Is that right? \t \n[120]\t          You will? For sure? \t \n[121]\t          We'll be on teams, me and you? \t \n[122]\t          Way to go, Karl. We got a \t          touchdown. That was a good lateral, \t          man. That was just like the \t          Wishbone. \t \n[123]\t          We're liable to win if we keep this \t          up. For somebody like you, you sure \t          run fast. \t \tHe grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up. \t \n[124]\t          Come on, let's kick off to 'em. \t \n[125]\t          I know you could of scored them \t          three touchdowns by yourself \t          instead of throwing 'em over to me. \t \n[126]\t          You're strong though. You let me \t          make them touchdowns so I'd feel \t          good. My daddy used to do that kind \t          of thing. \t \tThey walk in silence for a moment. \t \n[127]\t          It don't matter to me about us \t          losin' does it to you? \t \n[128]\t          It was fun, anyhow. \t \n[129]\t          Can we play ever' Saturday? \t \n[130]\t          Yeah, I guess. \t \n[131]\t          Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama \t          said -- \t \tDoyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm. \tDoyle shakes him off. \t \n[132]\t          Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come \t          out here? \t \n[133]\t          Just diggin'. \t \t          I ain't ever gonna be happy now. \t          Not with that son of a bitch movin' \t          in for good. I wish me and you and \t          Mama could just run away. But she \t          said he would find us wherever we \t          went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think \t          it would of been better if I wadn't \t          ever born. \t \n[134]\t          You have to Karl. You have to look \t          out for me. You don't let that son \t          of a bitch run you off. \t \n[135]\t          Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' \t          bad about you, but why don't you \t          stop Doyle when he gets that away? \t          You're older than him. You're \t          strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let \t          him do that to me and Mama. \t \n[136]\t          Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, \t          you know that. A kid my age \t          shouldn't be tired of things. \t \n[137]\t          I care for you, too. But you'll be \t          around, don't say that. \t \n[138]\t          You don't want to give away all \t          your books. \t \n[139]\t          Man. Thanks. \t \t          You know when you get a feelin' and \t          you don't know why? \t \n[140]\t          I've got a feelin' today. \t \n[141]\t          Like something different. I don't \t          know. \t \t          You're leavin' ain't you, Karl? \t \n[142]\t          You know I would. Whatever you \t          want. \t \n[143]\t          Okay. I give you my word. Is \t          ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you \t          all right? \t \n[144]\t          Okay. \t \tKarl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand \ton Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then \tKarl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes \tthe book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a \tfolded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be \thappy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in \tthe trees. \t \n[145]\t          Karl! \t \tKarl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other \tthrough the trees. \t ", "Wheatley": "\n[1]\t \tDOYLE is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle \tdrinking beer. He's in his late thirties and dressed in his \tconstruction clothes. Linda sits on the arm of the chair and \tFrank stands before them. \t \n[2]\t \tLinda, Frank, and Doyle are eating. \t \n[3]\t \tFrank and Karl walk up the steps to the house. Frank opens \tthe door and they enter. \t \n[4]\t \tKarl is on his cot reading a book. Frank comes in. He looks \tvery depressed. He sits beside Karl. \t \n[5]\t \tAll the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed \tasleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed \tstaring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring. \tSuddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp \tand sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a \tstart. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door \tholding a hammer. \t \n[6]\t \tDoyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come \tthrough the front door. \t \n[7]\t \tKarl stares at the house from the sidewalk. \t \n[8]\t \tKarl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the \tliving room. \t ", "Scooter": "\n[1]\t          And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I \t          always wanted to kill him myself. \t          Asshole's what he was. I remember \t          that ol' boy \t \t          too. Kind of retarded or somethin' \t          back in school. \t \n[2]\t          I don't guess. Can he talk? \t \n[3]\t          They make a good double meat \t          burger. \t \n[4]\t          Wait up, I'll leave with you and \t          lock up. \t \n[5]\t          I can't remember. \t \n[6]\t \t          Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe \t          you did tell me that one before. \t          I've heard that a bunch. Long time \t          ago. \t \n[7]\t          I can go. You don't have to. You \t          don't never go. \t ", "Hodges": "", "Jerry": "", "Woolridge": "\n[1]\t          Oh yeah, from the college? \t \n[2]\t          My name's Jerry Woolridge. \t \n[3]\t          Y'all have a seat. Is this all of \t          you? \t \n[4]\t          I think there must have been a \t          little mix up. I told your sponsor \t          or teacher or whatever he is, there \t          couldn't be any pictures. It's \t          s'posed to be just a little story \t          or article or something, isn't that \t          right? \t \n[5]\t          Karl's real sensitive about having \t          his picture made. He wouldn't even \t          be on the bulletin board for the \t          Easter Collage. \t \t          Melvin, would you get me a good hot \t          cup with two sugar substitutes? You \t          girls want some coffee? \t \n[6]\t          The other thing is I told your boss \t          on the phone to send a man. Karl \t          won't talk to women. \t \n[7]\t \tThe girls look confused. \t \n[8]\t          I don't know what to tell you. I'm \t          sorry. I made myself pretty clear I \t          thought. He probably got busy and \t          wasn't thinking. I know how that \t          is. I used to teach shop and eighth \t          grade science. \t \n[9]\t          He has problems. You know. With all \t          that. He won't hardly talk to \t          anybody really. Just certain \t          people. He's very troubled. \t \n[10]\t \n[11]\t \t          I don't think he's talked to a \t          woman in twenty-five or so years. \t          That I know of anyway. That's why I \t          said to send a man. At least maybe \t          he'd answer a question or two for a \t          man. I'm all for helping the \t          college out, believe me. It might \t          be a real good article or story. \t \n[12]\t \t          Melvin, go get Karl and take him \t          down to the old classroom. \t \n[13]\t          I'll talk to him and see what we \t          can do. \t \n[14]\t          You see, Karl, growing up, only \t          knew that sex was wrong and that \t          people who did it should be killed \t          for it. He couldn't really read \t          but, well, neither could his \t          mother. But, his father made sure \t          that his mother knew what the Bible \t          said. And she made sure Karl knew. \t          You know he slept in a hole in the \t          ground under a toolshed, right? \t \n[15]\t          His mother told him that he was \t          their punishment. Hers and his \t          father's; from God, for having sex-- \t \n[16]\t          I don't think so. Just period, I \t          think. She told him... God gave \t          them the ugliest creation he could \t          think of. Karl has an entire book -- \t          a notebook. On every page it says \t          \"Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number \t          1.\" He wrote that a few years ago \t          after he'd learned to write. His \t          father's name was Franklin. \t \n[17]\t          One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I \t          imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. \t          I'll go out and talk to him. \t \n[18]\t          Karl, you know, do you remember \t          when I told you about those people \t          from that newspaper? \t \t          They want to ask you some questions \t          about your release. They think it \t          would make an interesting story. \t          Will you talk to 'em? Get \t          interviewed. \t \t          Now, they're women. I think it \t          might be good for you to. You're \t          gonna be seein' all kinds of people \t          when you go on the outside. This'll \t          help you I believe. \t \n[19]\t          Well, it surprised the dickens out \t          of me. He said he'll talk to you. \t \tMarsha smiles and looks at Theresa. \t \n[20]\t          But, here's the thing. He'll only \t          talk to you. He doesn't want you to \t          ask him anything. And you shouldn't \t          stare at him. \t \n[21]\t          It's the best you're gonna get. I'm \t          sorry. \t \n[22]\t          He's free. His time's up. That's \t          the rules. He's been treated and \t          reevaluated. He doesn't show any \t          signs any more. \t \n[23]\t          Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna \t          change the light in here for Karl. \t          I hope you can see to write. \t \tWoolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the \toverhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in. \tIn the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions \tfor Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless. \tWoolridge whispers to Theresa. \t \n[24]\t          You'll have to step outside. \t \tTheresa starts to protest. \t \n[25]\t          Please. \t \tKarl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin \tushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at \tthe floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing \tstrangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like \tforever. \t \n[26]\t          We've got some paperwork to take \t          care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, \t          you won't run into him in the \t          parking lot. \t \n[27]\t          I hope the best for you, Miss \t          Dwiggins, with your school and your \t          paper and all. \t \n[28]\t          Wherever he wants to. I think he's \t          going back to Millsburg where he's \t          from. It's just about twenty miles \t          from here. \t \n[29]\t          As much as anybody else is, I \t          guess. Y'all have a good rest of \t          the day now. \t \tMarsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he \tspeaks to Marsha. \t \n[30]\t          Yes, I guess you are. \t \n[31]\t          You better go get your things. \t \n[32]\t          You better go get 'em. \t \n[33]\t \tKarl finds Woolridge doing paper work. Woolridge looks up \tstartled. \t \n[34]\t          Karl, what in the world are you \t          doing here? \t \n[35]\t          Well, you can't do that. You're a \t          free man. You've been let out to do \t          as you please. \t \n[36]\t          Well, you have to learn. It'll take \t          some time. Don't you know anybody \t          down there to help you out? \t \n[37]\t          Your daddy's still livin' down \t          there from what you told me. \t \t          I guess he wouldn't help you any, \t          would he? I wasn't thinking. You \t          don't know anybody? \t \n[38]\t \t          Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't \t          know where they expect you to go or \t          what they expect you to do. If it \t          was up to me, I'd let you stay here \t          if that's what you wanted. I'm just \t          doin' my job. \t              (they sit in silence for a \t               moment \t          You follow me? \t \t          Listen, I know an old boy that runs \t          a fix-it shop deal down in \t          Millsburg. He used to go to church \t          with me. You're good workin' on \t          small engines and things. If I put \t          my neck out for you with him, will \t          you work at it if he'll hire you? \t \n[39]\t          I know, I've seen it myself. Would \t          you give that a try? \t \n[40]\t          I can't promise he'll hire you. \t          I'll have to tell him about your \t          history. \t \n[41]\t          No, I mean your past. About why you \t          were in here. \t \t          I'll take you first thing in the \t          mornin'. You have anyplace you can \t          stay tonight at all? \t          I just can't let you stay here. \t          It's the rules. If something \t          happened well, I'd be liable. \t \n[42]\t \tWoolridge, his WIFE, his teenage SON, BUBBA, and teenage \tDAUGHTER sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely \tuncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge \tof a chair looking at the floor. After a long creepy moment, \tMom speaks. \t \n[43]\t          Karl, would you like a muffin? \t \n[44]\t          I understand Jerry is going to take \t          you somewhere else tomorrow. \t \n[45]\t          She's talkin' about me, Karl. \t          That's my first name. \t \n[46]\t          Would you like some coffee? \t \n[47]\t          Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama \t          tonight. I'll sleep with your \t          brother and Karl can take your \t          room. \t \n[48]\t          We have company. Now you go on. \t \n[49]\t          Well, Karl, there's plenty of \t          blankets and things there. \t          Bathroom's right there in the hall. \t          We'll leave first thing tomorrow. \t \tKarl stands in the middle of the room holding his books. \tWoolridge closes the door. \t \n[50]\t \tWoolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the \ttable. \t \n[51]\t          Jerry, why didn't you give him \t          Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of \t          girly, isn't it? \t \n[52]\t          Yeah, I thought about that. No \t          sense in moving him now I guess. \t \n[53]\t          Why, hell no, son. What's wrong \t          with you? \t \n[54]\t          'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't. \t \n[55]\t \tWoolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down \tthe hallway. He knocks on the bedroom door. \t \n[56]\t          Karl, you up? \t \n[57]\t          Didn't you go to sleep at all, \t          Karl? You been sittin' there like \t          that all night? \t \n[58]\t          Well, I guess we better hit the \t          road. \t \n[59]\t          Good to see you, Bill. How's \t          everybody doin'? \t \n[60]\t          No, don't guess I do. \t              (he shakes hands with \t               Scooter who sort of \t               smiles \t          Scooter, good to meet you. \t              (Woolridge leans in and \t               gets confidential \t          This is him, the one I talked to \t          you about on the phone. Now like I \t          said, I'll understand if you get \t          nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie \t          to you now, he did get in that \t          trouble but then he was real young. \t \n[61]\t          Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted \t          these days. I don't think he'd ever \t          hurt anybody. \t \n[62]\t          He's a regular whiz at it. That's \t          all he did when he was a kid. \t \n[63]\t          Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate \t          it. He needs the job. I don't know \t          what to do with him. He don't have \t          anybody really. \t \n[64]\t          He won't have anything to do with \t          him. Now you say it's all right for \t          him to stay out here in the back? \t \n[65]\t          He won't steal. I'm tellin' you \t          he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps \t          to himself. \t \n[66]\t          Karl, come over here. I want you to \t          meet your new boss. \t              (Karl obediently shuffles \t               over \t          This is Bill Cox, runs this place. \t          Says you can work here and stay in \t          the back. \t \n[67]\t          That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to \t          the car and get your books. \t \tWoolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl \tstares at the floor. \t \n[68]\t          How are you, Bill? \t \n[69]\t          Just thought I'd check on Karl and \t          see if everything's working out. \t \n[70]\t          Is him stayin' here workin' out? \t \n[71]\t          Can I see him? \t \n[72]\t          Are you sure you're okay staying \t          with that woman and boy? \t \n[73]\t          Do they know about you? \t \n[74]\t          Yeah. \t \n[75]\t          I'll be. \t \n[76]\t          I knew you'd do all right. Well, I \t          just wanted to check on you. I'll \t          say bye to Bill and get on back. \t \tThey walk over to Bill. \t \n[77]\t          I'll see you, Bill. \t ", "Doyle": "\n[1]\t          Well, honey, I don't guess I give a \t          shit. I ain't here half the time \t          anyway. If you want a retard livin' \t          in the garage, I don't guess I \t          care. I've got a good tool box and \t          socket set out there I don't want \t          stol'd.

I'm lettin' it go on \t          because she asked me, not you. \t \t          Now is this the kind of retard that \t          drools and rubs shit in his hair \t          and all that, 'cause I have trouble \t          eatin' around that kind of thing. \t          Just like I am about antique \t          furniture and midgets. I can't so \t          much as drink a glass of water \t          around a midget or a piece of \t          antique furniture. Same thing with \t          a droolin' retard. \t \n[4]\t          I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just \t          tellin' the truth.

Morris is a modern day \t          poet like in the old days. \t \n[54]\t          If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go \t          out of my mind. And plus you're \t          liable to bust a spring in Karl's \t          head. He's already off balance. \t \n[55]\t          We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all \t          just shut the fuck up! We don't \t          need no practicin' or managers \t          cause we ain't no fuckin' band! \t          Morris ain't no genius and the rest \t          of you are just losers. Am I the \t          only one sane human bein' around \t          here? Just get the hell out of my \t          house and don't come back! \t \n[56]\t          I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! \t          You mind your own business. Now get \t          out! Now, before I get too mad to \t          turn back. \t \n[57]\t          Now! \t \tThey all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit \tfrozen on the sofa. \t \n[58]\t          Get out of my goddamn face, you \t          fuckin' buzzard! \t \tHe slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the \tsofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in \tthe doorway. \t \n[59]\t          I thought I told everybody to get \t          out of my house. That includes \t          cocksuckers and retards. Get off \t          your asses and go. \t \n[60]\t          You know better than to talk like \t          that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make \t          me knock the piss out of you. \t \n[61]\t          That's funny. \t \t          You go to bed and take snot nose \t          with you. \t \tLinda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets \tup also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together. \t \n[62]\t          You know what I told you, you even \t          think of leavin' me, I'll kill you \t          dead as a doornail. \t \n[63]\t          I thought I told you to keep out! \t \n[64]\t          Don't tell me what to do. \t \n[65]\t          Don't tell me what to do. \t \n[66]\t          Don't tell me what to do. \t \n[67]\t \t          Don't tell me what to do. \t \tShe shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the \tface. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes \twild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty \tcans, bottles, a lampstand. \tHe connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to \tthe door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost \tpitiful. \t \n[68]\t          Okay, I'll leave and sober up. \t          Everything's botherin' me, that's \t          all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you. \t \n[69]\t          Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. \t          I love your mama. Nobody \t          understands what I go through. I'll \t          leave. You bunch of freaks have \t          fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. \t          I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, \t          really. \t \t          You ever hit me again you little \t          bastard and I'll make you sorry \t          your daddy ever squirted your \t          little ass out. \t \tHe leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as \tdoes Vaughan. \t \n[70]\t          Well, I'll be damned, there's the \t          boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I \t          wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was \t          just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell, \t          I'll just start over, set down you \t          boys. \t \tThey do, on the couch. \t \n[71]\t          Well, what it is is, I just, well I \t          took off work early today and your \t          mama was good enough to do the same \t          so we could talk. I guess you'd say \t          I'm really here to apologize, which \t          ain't easy for me to do, about the \t          way I acted the other night. I was \t          just drunk and kinda got a little \t          too worked up and one thing led to \t          another. I care about y'all a lot, \t          I do. I don't mean to be so damned, \t          assholish I guess the word would \t          be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit \t          you, did I? So no apology needed \t          there I guess, but Frank, I'm \t          sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama. \t          I'm just jealous of her. I don't \t          like her life or the way she runs \t          it. I don't like homosexuals and \t          she buddies with one. I don't like \t          little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' \t          mental retards and she's got one of \t          each livin' with her. \t \t          I was just kiddin'. But really I \t          guess people need to get along even \t          if they have differences. \t \t          You see, I work construction. I \t          build things. Do you realize how \t          important that is to the world. I \t          have a lot of pressure on me. The \t          upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot \t          more time over here and we're gonna \t          get along. Like a family should. \t \t          I may even surprise you one day and \t          pop the question. \t \t          Well, I'm goin' back to work. I \t          just wanted to give y'all some \t          little piece of happiness today. \t \t          See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a \t          good boy, Frank. \t \tHe leaves. \t \n[72]\t          What in the goddamn hell are you \t          doin'? It's the middle of the \t          night. \t \n[73]\t          Baptized? Well, get baptized then. \t          I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' \t          preacher, goddamnit! I can't \t          baptize you. \t \n[74]\t          What are you doin' with that damn \t          hammer? \t \n[75]\t          How'd your baptizin' go? \t \n[76]\t          Well, that's good. It's about time \t          to eat and you know what I'm \t          cravin'? Some of that take out \t          chicken. Why don't you run get some \t          of it, honey, for lunch? \t \n[77]\t          Naw, hell, let them stay here with \t          me and do men things. There might \t          be some kind of ball game on we can \t          watch. You go on. \t \n[78]\t          I really just wanted to git your \t          mama out of the house for a minute \t          so we can have a talk. Y'all set \t          down. \t \tThey sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them. \t \n[79]\t          Now here's the deal. Now that I'm \t          gonna throw my entire life away \t          doin' what I want to come live here \t          with y'all, we have to get a few \t          things straight. See, Frank, me and \t          you mama wouldn't have any problems \t          if it wadn't for you. We'd never \t          have a bad word between us. But \t          since you do exist, if I'm gonna be \t          here as the head of the household, \t          we'll have to live by my rules. \t          And my rules are you don't speak \t          unless you're spoken to. Stay out \t          of my way and do what a regular kid \t          does. You're a weird little shit. I \t          don't get you. So wake up. Face \t          what they call reality. We're gonna \t          be a family now. And it's my \t          family. I'll be payin' the bills so \t          you got me. But I ain't your daddy. \t          You just treat me like I am. I'm \t          the boss, okay. And the other thing \t          is your friend Karl has to go. We \t          can't have a normal family with him \t          livin' in the garage and comin' in \t          the bedroom at four in the mornin' \t          with hammers and shit. See? \t \n[80]\t          You shut up you, fuckin' retard. \t          Get your shit and get out of here. \t \t          That was a wake-up slap, Frank. \t          Remember. Reality, like I said. \t          Don't forget any bit of what I said \t          to you and we'll be fine. \t \tFrank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in \this chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the \tgarage. \t \n[81]\t          Where's ever'body else? You seen \t          'em? \t \t          I thought I told you to get the \t          hell moved out of here anyway. \t \n[82]\t          Pick up the fuckin' phone and call \t          'em, I guess. \t \n[83]\t          I told you to get away from here, \t          didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and \t          look at TV. \t \t          What are you doin' with that piece \t          of iron? I swear to God you're the \t          weirdest son of a bitch I ever \t          heard of. \t \n[84]\t          Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police \t          you push 911. You'll need to tell \t          'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a \t          hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're \t          gonna kill me. \t \t \tKarl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We \tsee the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear \tone short dull thud. \t \n[85]\t          Oh God! Oh God! \t \tWe hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting \tthe floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to \tthe kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it \tfor a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood \ton his face, hand and shirt. \t ", "Hargraves": "", "Linda": "\n[1]\t          Hey, sweetheart. What you up to? \t \n[2]\t          Frank, don't talk that way. Who's \t          that strange lookin' man behind \t          you? Did he follow you in here? \t \n[3]\t          Nice to meet you, Karl. \t \n[4]\t          Frank come back here with me for a \t          minute. \t \tShe shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl. \t \n[5]\t          Frank told me about your situation. \t          And Frank loves company. You know, \t          especially after his daddy passed \t          and all. There ain't no sense in \t          you stayin' in that old greasy \t          shop. \t \t          He's mentally retarded, poor thing. \t \n[6]\t \t          I know. \t \n[7]\t          Frank's just crazy about him. He \t          likes the way he talks. He helped \t          him carry home the clean laundry. \t \n[8]\t          He's retarded's all. You know he's \t          always after a father figure and \t          Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one \t          with his mean ass. \t \n[9]\t          I don't think he sees you as a guy \t          guy. \t \n[10]\t          Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't \t          be that way. \t \n[11]\t          He's just mentally retarded, I \t          guess. \t \n[12]\t          Yeah, that's right, Frank, you \t          better ask him. I mean, don't hurt \t          his feelin's or anything, but it \t          would be good to know. I'm sure \t          it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. \t \n[13]\t          He'll be here in a little while, \t          he's takin' me to get an ice cream. \t \n[14]\t          You're not crippled. Get in there \t          and make somethin'. \t \n[15]\t          Frank, why don't you go off and \t          play in your room if Doyle's gonna \t          talk nasty. \t \n[16]\t          Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl? \t \n[17]\t \t          Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. \t          Frank, why don't you and Karl go \t          out in the garage and fix him up a \t          place or play a game or somethin'. \t          Vaughan, you ready to go? \t \n[18]\t \t          Maybe you and Karl want to go with \t          us? \t \n[19]\t          Let's go, Vaughan. \t \t          Frank, we'll be back in a little \t          while. I'll bring you back \t          somethin'. You're food's in the \t          oven warmin' over. \t \n[20]\t          How come Karl won't eat here with \t          us? \t \n[21]\t          I just feel sorry for the poor \t          thing. \t \n[22]\t          He does make some funny noises. \t \n[23]\t          I'm glad of it, honey. \t \n[24]\t          What? \t \n[25]\t          Please Doyle, don't. \t \n[26]\t          Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not \t          up for it. They always stay till \t          mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle. \t \n[27]\t          Karl, now listen, there's gonna be \t          a party tonight here at the house. \t          Doyle's invited his music-playin' \t          buddies over to make a bunch of \t          racket out on the patio. \t \n[28]\t          He's no more an Indian than I am \t          though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try \t          and tease you and be mean to you to \t          show off to his friends. Just like \t          he does to Frank and me sometimes. \t          You just ignore it. Or stay out \t          here away from 'em if he'll let \t          you. He's an okay guy till he gets \t          drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. \t          I guarantee it. \t \n[29]\t          No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to \t          come to a party with you. \t \n[30]\t \n[31]\t          Karl, you better clap your hands or \t          he'll just keep on. \t \tKarl claps his hands a little. \t \n[32]\t          He don't want to Doyle. Don't go \t          Vaughan if you don't want to. \t          You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk. \t \n[33]\t          This is not your house, Doyle. This \t          is my house and I'll say who stays \t          and goes. You've got a house, why \t          don't you go get one of your \t          girlfriends and go home to it. \t \n[34]\t          You're not stayin' here tonight. Go \t          get sober before you come back. I'm \t          tired of my child seein' this. Now \t          you get yourself straight or I'll \t          lock your ass out of my life for \t          good. \t \n[35]\t          That might be better than this. \t \n[36]\t          Leave. \t \n[37]\t          Leave. \t \n[38]\t          Leave. \t \n[39]\t          Leave. \t \n[40]\t          I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and \t          forget about tonight. \t \n[41]\t          No, honey, we don't. \t \t          I'll make some coffee and start \t          cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you \t          want some coffee, huh? \t \n[42]\t          What are you doin' up again, Frank? \t          You need to get a little sleep. \t \n[43]\t          Yeah, he has to go to work in a \t          little while. I do too. \t \n[44]\t          I guess. He went to the garage. \t          Poor thing, he's probably never \t          seen such a crazy mess. He probably \t          wants to go back and live in Mr. \t          Cox's shop. \t \n[45]\t          I know he does. \t \n[46]\t          Huh? \t \n[47]\t          Yeah, honey, someday everything's \t          gonna be all right. \t \n[48]\t          I promise we're gonna get away from \t          him. The time has to be right, \t          that's all. I'd rather him get \t          tired of me and leave me. Then he \t          wouldn't want to hurt me. He \t          wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. \t          I promise. You go to bed now. \t \t          I love you. \t \n[49]\t          You scared me. \t \n[50]\t          Want to sit down? Did you need \t          somethin'? \t \n[51]\t \t          I'll be dog. \t \tMore silence. \t \n[52]\t          Right now? \t \n[53]\t          Well, it is nearly breakfast time \t          anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have \t          to be at work in three hours. You \t          know how it is when you just sleep \t          an hour or two, you feel worse than \t          if you hadn't slept at all? \t \n[54]\t          Well, set down and I'll make some \t          biscuits and gravy. \t \n[55]\t          Okay. \t \tKarl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits. \t \n[56]\t          It's all right. \t \t          You know I was thinkin' there's \t          this girl that works with me. She's \t          real heavy, but she's cute in the \t          face. Well, you know, she's slow. \t          She's a little bit, I think. She's \t          not retarded, just -- it don't \t          matter, listen to me. I thought you \t          might like to meet her. Vaughan \t          wants to have a little supper over \t          at his house and we could invite \t          her. Would you like that? \t \n[57]\t          Vaughan's \"friend\" will be there, \t          too. He works at the funeral home. \t          And Frank. You know Frank likes you \t          a lot. He says you make him feel \t          calm. \t \n[58]\t          That's okay. It's not really my \t          business. I have wondered though. \t          Why was it? Was it like a nervous \t          breakdown? \t \n[59]\t          Was that you? I remember that. I \t          was only three or four, but I \t          always heard about it growin' up. \t \t          They say you're well? \t \n[60]\t          I believe you. I really do. \t \n[61]\t \t          Why don't we talk about something a \t          little more festive. \t \n[62]\t          Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda \t          was voted employee of the month at \t          the Dollar Store last February. \t          Isn't that somethin'? \t \n[63]\t          Well, when you like pricing items \t          as much as I do, I guess it's just \t          bound to happen sooner or later. \t \n[64]\t          Vaughan, don't get pushy. \t \n[65]\t          I stay on my feet all the time at \t          work. I just can't find shoes \t          that's comfortable. \t \n[66]\t          I get real mean when my feet hurt. \t          It's the only time I don't like \t          checkin' out the customers, when my \t          feet hurt. \t \n[67]\t          Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin' \t          much, you boys must really like \t          that food. \t \n[68]\t          That's very sweet of you Vaughan. \t          We care about you, too. Don't we \t          y'all? \t \tNods, grunts, \"Sure do's.\" \t \n[69]\t          Why? \t \n[70]\t          You mean about y'all bein' together \t          in \"that\" way? \t \n[71]\t          I think everybody at the store \t          knows that already. They always \t          talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter \t          told a awful story about why you \t          ain't allowed over at the First \t          Baptist Church no more. \t \n[72]\t          Karl, why don't you and Melinda go \t          take a walk. It's nice out. \t \n[73]\t          You walk fast, don't you? \t \n[74]\t          These is the worst shoes I own for \t          walkin'. How far did you want to \t          go? \t \n[75]\t          Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These \t          was on sale 'cause they're not \t          fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus \t          my ten percent employee discount. \t          Since I didn't bring you anything \t          to our date last night, I thought \t          you'd like to have 'em. \t \tShe hands them to him. \t \n[76]\t          Well, I just thought I'd give you \t          them. I liked walkin' with you. I \t          got a blister the size of a quarter \t          on one heel. Well, I'll see you \t          sometime, I guess. \t \tShe walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say \tsomething. \t \n[77]\t          Yeah. \t \n[78]\t          Me, too. \t \tShe leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers \tand watches her walk away. \t \n[79]\t          Well, at least he's tryin'. But who \t          knows for how long. \t \n[80]\t          I know honey. Just remember what I \t          said, we'll bide our time. You just \t          steer clear of him as much as you \t          can. Doyle's had a real hard life. \t          It's just about run him crazy I \t          think. \t \n[81]\t          You're a hell of a boy, Frank. \t          Someday you're gonna get all the \t          good things you deserve. And Karl \t          here's gonna get some more biscuits \t          tonight. What do you think about \t          that? \t \n[82]\t          What do you want, hun? \t \n[83]\t          We'll go to church and get you \t          baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go \t          on back to bed. \t \n[84]\t          It went real good. \t \n[85]\t \t          Would y'all like that? \t \n[86]\t          All right, y'all gonna go with me? \t \n[87]\t          I'll be back in a little bit then. \t \tShe leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank. \t \n[88]\t          Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't \t          you want some chicken and things? \t \n[89]\t          Well, okay. I got you some. \t \n[90]\t          Where'd he go? What's goin' on? \t \n[91]\t          All right then. Well, I'll see you \t          later. If you see Frank, tell him \t          to come on back home. I don't get \t          to see him all day except Sundays. \t          He can play tomorrow. \t \n[92]\t          Yeah. \t \n[93]\t          Well thank you, hun. That's real \t          good of you to say. I wouldn't know \t          what to do without him either. \t \n[94]\t          We sure like havin' you. \t ", "Karl's": "", "Father": ""}}
