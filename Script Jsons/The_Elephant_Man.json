This muck can kill you. \n[5]Take this up, to to the man in the isolation ward when you have a moment, won't you? \n[6]Indeed! \n[7]  \n[8]A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious? \n[9]Why isn't he in the General Ward, then? \n[10]Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable? \n[11]What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point. \n[12]Oh, is he a friend of yours? \n[13]     \n[14]I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him. \n[15]The Elephant Man? \n[16]  \n[17]Ah, Treves... \n[18]Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital? \n[19]Good! How is the patient? \n[20]A few words? I thought he was imbecile? \n[21]I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are. \n[22]No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say \"Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means,\" I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee. \n[23]Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry. \n[24]Well, go to the authorities... \n[25]By all means do so. In fact, I'll fetch them myself. I'm quite sure they'd be very interested in your story, as well as ours. \n[26]Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves. \n[27]Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? \n[28]Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance. \n[29] \n[30]Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend? \n[31]He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about? \n[32]Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them. \n[33]I'm very... pleased to meet you. \n[34]How are you feeling today? \n[35]I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis? \n[36]Are you comfortable here? \n[37]Oh yes? \n[38] \n[39]No, I meant in your former situation. \n[40]Tell me, how do you like Mr. Treves? As a teacher? \n[41]Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview? \n[42]Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day. \n[43]It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words. \n[44]I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day. \n[45]What is it, Treves? \n[46]I don't understand. \n[47]It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick. \n[48]I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day. \n[49]I want to see you in my office as soon as you're through up here. We've a good deal to discuss. \n[50]Treves. Well done. \n[51]  \n[52]Can you imagine what his life has been like? \n[53]No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can. \n[54]You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick. \n[55]No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick? \n[56]Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities. \n[57]Of course they will. They're reasonable men. \n[58]As far as I can see, the only obstacle might be Broadneck. He has enormous influence over the others, very old school, not an easy man to impress. In any case, if worse does come to worse, we still have the British and Royal Homes to fall back on, don't we. \n[59]Don't we? \n[60]Well, it's up to us then, isn't it? \n[61]Don't worry Treves, we'll make them see it our way. \n[62]They've eyes, haven't they? \n[63]Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. There are two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick's needs. I also propose to write a letter to The Times, appealing to their readers for assistance. Knowing the generosity of the British public, I feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. So therefore, I propose, if Mr. Treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. All those in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here? \n[64]I see. All, then, that move we keep Mr. Merrick here? \n[65]All those opposed? \n[66]I see. \n[67]I second the motion gentlemen. This meeting is adjourned. \n[68]Somehow I don't think they quite understand. \n[69]Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time. \n[70]Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post. \n[71]Ahh! Broadneck! You'll no doubt be pleased to know that we've received a smashing response to my letter. It's all very heartwarming, though several letters do mention how beastly it would be to part the poor fellow from Mr. Treves and the staff, but since the committee insists... \n[72]  \n[73]I'm afraid so, Mrs. Mothershead. Perhaps tomorrow. \n[74]  \n[75]Steady on, Treves. Have a seat. \n[76]Gentlemen, I know we begin every meeting by reading the minutes, but in the interest of speed I think we should conclude a matter discussed previously, to wit, that of Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man... \n[77]Mr. Broadneck? \n[78]I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind is fixed on this matter? \n[79]Yes, I believe that time has come. \n[80]Indeed not, your Highness. Your presence is always greatly appreciated. We were just about to put the matter of Mr. Merrick to a vote. The Princess is very interested in Mr. Merrick's fate. \n[81]Thank you very much, your Highness, you may be sure we shall. \n[82]Well then, I move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted to the London Hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that the Hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds. All those in favor. \n[83]The motion is carried. \n[84]Well, now we may go about our normal business. \n[85]Mr. Merrick, it is my great pleasure to welcome you, officially to The London Hospital. The Governing Committee this morning voted unanimously to provide you these rooms on a permanent basis. This is your home now. I'm so very, very pleased for you. \n[86]I'd like to think I felt no less for John than you, Treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to the continent. There's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients. Remember Treves, you did everything in your power... everything in your power. \n[87]   \n[88]  ", "Gomm": "\n[1]  \n[2]     \n[3]  \n[4]  \n[5]I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind is fixed on this matter?

It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? \n[10]Won't come out, eh? \n[11]Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it. \n[12]Alright, my son, none of this fuss. Come up from there, this instant. \n[13]Honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. All he understands is a good smack. \n[14]Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir. \n[15]Patients here are not \"its\". They are either \"he's\" or \"she's\", but that's alright, Ireland.

You know they won't let him stay here. \n[18]Read it. \n[19]Credit where credit is due. You'll have the paper every morning at breakfast. \n[20]Well, I think I can safely hand the duties over to you girls now. Mr. Merrick will require a bath every day... that way he won't pong quite so much. Nora, you can instruct Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. Merrick's bath. You'll be on your own tomorrow. \n[21]Don't look so glum girls. Such enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful. \n[22]Oh, and girls, under no circumstances are there to be any mirrors brought into this room. \n[23] \n[24]Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you. \n[25]I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir. \n[26]But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends. \n[27]I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it. \n[28]If you ask me, sir, he's just being stared at all over again. \n[29]Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick. \n[30]Yes sir. What's that? \n[31]Very smart indeed. \n[32]A dressing bag? \n[33]Well... \n[34]A dressing bag? \n[35]Is this all there is for John? \n[36]What is it? What is it? \n[37]Welcome home, John. \n[38]Good God... John? \n[39]Done. \n[40]Little beast! I thought mummy told you not to bring that horrid thing. Can't you behave? \n[41]Do be quiet Little Jim.

Do you understand? \n[42] \n[43]Are you ready? \n[44]Go ahead. \n[45]He is English, he is twenty-one years of age and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have I met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. The alarming curvature of the spine... Turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body. \n[46]...And there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since birth. The Patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side-note, in spite of the afore-mentioned anomalies, the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected. \n[47]So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of deformities: The congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, \"The Elephant Man.\" \n[48]  \n[49]Hmm? \n[50]Hmm? \n[51]It's been a long day for everyone. \n[52]Oh, yes, you'll need a cab... Stay. \n[53]Come with me. \n[54]He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot... I pray God he's an idiot. \n[55]  \n[56]Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed? \n[57]No, I think a whiskey. \n[58]What is it? \n[59]I'll get my bag. \n[60]What do you mean? \n[61]I intend to. \n[62]What happened? \n[63]He must have taken quite a fall. \n[64]Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest. \n[65]This man belongs in hospital. \n[66]You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his \"fall\". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab. \n[67] \n[68]I don't know if you will understand this, but you will never go back to that man again. You're safe now. No one will ever harm you. Do you understand? \n[69]It's for a patient. \n[70]Good morning, sir. \n[71]It's quite nutritious, sir. \n[72]Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you. \n[73]No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten. \n[74]Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking. \n[75]Yes sir. \n[76]Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional. \n[77]No, more of an acquaintance. \n[78]Yes sir, I'll look into that. Would you like to meet him sir? \n[79]Excuse me, sir. \n[80]I'm sorry, my dear, I should have warned you. I'm so terribly sorry, please forgive me. There, you're alright now. Go downstairs and please ask Mrs. Mothershead to come up. Tell her to knock on the door and wait for me. Alright? \n[81]I'm very sorry about that. Are you resting well? \n[82]Ah good. Well then... oh yes, we'll have to get you some more food. I'm sure you must be simply famished. Hmm? \n[83]Of course you are. Now then, I think you'll be quite comfortable up here for awhile. I'll see to it you have everything you need, and, uh... yes. \n[84]Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today? \n[85]Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance. \n[86]Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him... \n[87]Yes... Yes, let's go in. \n[88](to the E.M., hereafter Merrick \n[89]The disease is shocking. \n[90]I wonder how far it can go before it... \n[91]It's pretty certain that if he had the disease as a child, he was abandoned. But in that case, he'd have to have had care. The very fact that he's alive bears that out... But, where? \n[92]Yes! The workhouse! \n[93] \n[94]Good morning, Charley. I'll keep that in mind! \n[95]Mr. Merrick? \n[96]....Good morning... John. I've brought your breakfast. \n[97]What are you doing down there? Come up John, come up on the bed. The cold floor is bad for you. I won't hurt you, come on now... \n[98]You must eat. We must keep your strength... \n[99]...What on earth is the matter with you? \n[100]Now please, John, you must do as I say. Come up from there. \n[101]Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning. \n[102]No, he's very upset about something. \n[103]No! Don't pull at him like that. We don't want to frighten him more than he already is. \n[104]He's had his share of \"smacks\", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man. \n[105] \n[106]...What is my purpose? ...It's so important that I understand you. I want to help you, I want to be your doctor... but I can't help you unless you help me, unless I know what you are feeling. I believe there's something back there, there's something you want to say, but I've got to understand you. Do you understand me? \n[107]No! You are going to talk to me! We are going to show them! We're going to show them that you're not a wall. We are going to talk! Do you understand? Nod your head if you understand me! \n[108]You do understand me! You understand. Now you're going to say it. I've got to hear how you say things. Now, very slowly, say \"yes.\" \n[109]\"Yes.\" \n[110](grabbing Merrick's arm \n[111]Yyyess. \n[112]That's much better. I could understand that \"yes\". \n[113]Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? \n[114]Excellent! Now, say... \"Hello\" \n[115]My name is... \n[116]John Merrick. \n[117]Say \"Merrick\". \n[118]Say \"Mmmerrick.\" \n[119]Say \"Mmmerrick.\" \n[120]Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ... \n[121]Come in. \n[122]Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself? \n[123] \n[124]  \n[125]I'll see you soon. \n[126]Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning. \n[127]He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules. \n[128]Well sir, perhaps I should explain... \n[129]I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met. \n[130]Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee. \n[131]Just a moment, how did you get in here? \n[132]He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation. \n[133]You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what... \n[134]I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that. \n[135]All you do is profit from another man's misery! \n[136]You don't own this man! \n[137]So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you! \n[138]Now I think we really do understand one another. \n[139] \n[140] \n[141]...Yes, Sir. \n[142] \n[143]  \n[144]I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom. \n[145]Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me. \n[146]He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself? \n[147]I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind? \n[148] \n[149]I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know. \n[150]I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm... \n[151]Righteousness... \n[152] \n[153]Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say \"May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm.\" And you will say... \n[154]It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear. \n[155]...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous. \n[156]Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly. \n[157]John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm. \n[158]Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John? \n[159] \n[160] \n[161] \n[162]Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him. \n[163]I didn't teach him that part! \n[164]How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it. \n[165]Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm? \n[166] \n[167]Of course, sir. Thank you, thank you very much. \n[168]Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness. \n[169]Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read? \n[170]I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me? \n[171]We do have a lot to talk about, don't we? \n[172]Yes, I think I can. \n[173]I could easily arrange... \n[174]Well, yes. \n[175]Do you think they'll go along with us? \n[176]No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him. \n[177]...Due to the progressive nature of the disease, I feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to live. \n[178]Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. The workhouse is certainly out of the question. The patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. His appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. He cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. The police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes. What is to be done with him? \n[179]Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. An intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the Bible. His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out. \n[180]Excuse me gentlemen. I seem to have lost my appetite. Good evening. \n[181]Good evening. How are you feeling? \n[182]Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular. \n[183]I came to tell you that I'll be here early tomorrow morning. We're moving you to your permanent home. I'm sure you'll be very happy there, John. So get a good night's rest, there'll be new people to meet tomorrow. Good night. \n[184]This is your new home, John. \n[185]Yes. \n[186]Of course! What did you think? \n[187]I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think? \n[188]Has the response picked up? \n[189]But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen. \n[190]Please do. \n[191]You look splendid, John. \n[192]When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best. \n[193]   \n[194]Make yourself comfortable, John. \n[195]Come and meet our quest, my love. \n[196]John Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne Treves. \n[197]John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset? \n[198]Yes, a cup of tea would go nicely. \n[199]John... would you like to see the rest of the house? \n[200]Come with me, John. I'll show it to you. \n[201]John loves the house. \n[202]Yes, we do have a lot of room. But you should see the place on weekends, when I see patients here. Sometimes there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. In fact, Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom. \n[203]That's a canopy, John. \n[204]How is your tea, John? \n[205]Not at all, John. \n[206]Oh yes. \n[207]Oh, our relatives... the children. \n[208]Of course. \n[209]Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends. \n[210]Yes. \n[211] \n[212]Good morning, John. \n[213]John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright? \n[214]John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick. \n[215]I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity. \n[216]Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening. \n[217]Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue. \n[218]Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital... \n[219]Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived. \n[220]You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me. \n[221]Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die. \n[222]Yes, John? \n[223]No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you. \n[224]John...? \n[225]Are you looking for me, Sister? \n[226]The cathedral is coming along nicely. \n[227]How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you? \n[228]Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have? \n[229]You want a dressing bag, John? \n[230]Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office. \n[231]A dressing bag. \n[232]Yes. John wants it. \n[233]You don't think it's too gaudy, do you. \n[234]John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree. \n[235]  \n[236]You stay with me. \n[237] \n[238]Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said. \n[239]That I am very little different from him. \n[240]But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous? \n[241]...Am I a good man or am I a bad man? \n[242]Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to... \n[243] \n[244]So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here. \n[245]Yes, John. \n[246]Yes. \n[247]There is one more thing, John. Here. \n[248]Is it the one you wanted? \n[249]Are you sure? Because I can take it back. \n[250]John? \n[251]\n[252]\n[253]Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him? \n[254]\n[255]YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is \n[256]\n[257]Yes... \n[258]Yes, he's... my friend. \n[259]John.... how can you ever forgive me? \n[260]I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited. \n[261]I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain. \n[262]And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain. \n[263]Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do. \n[264] \n[265]Stand up, John. Let them see you. \n[266]It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you. \n[267]Will the cathedral be finished soon, John? \n[268]Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening. \n[269]I'm glad, John. Goodnight. \n[270]Yes John? \n[271](looking at the cathedral \n[272]No, no, I wouldn't change a thing. \n[273]Goodnight John.

She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her. \n[74]If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good. \n[75]Please... please... \n[76]  \n[77]  \n[78]   \n[79]Good morning. \n[80]Yes. \n[81]Thank you... very much. \n[82]I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away. \n[83]The main spire. \n[84]...I learned a long time ago. \n[85]I'll have to find some more. \n[86]  \n[87]Come in. \n[88]Good morning. \n[89]Good day...! \n[90]Oh, no. \n[91]Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother. \n[92]Yes. \n[93]Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there? \n[94]Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful? \n[95]Alas, no. \n[96]Tell me about it, please! \n[97] \n[98]No, but I certainly shall. \n[99]Romeo and Juliet. I know of this... \"If I profane with my unworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\" \n[100]Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? \n[101]O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \n[102]Oh no? \n[103]Thank you for your kind gifts. I can't say enough about this ring. And this walking stick is ever so dashing. So much more elegant than my old one. More tea? \n[104]If you have a chill I can close the window. \n[105]I don't get out as often as I'd like to, for some people DO find my appearance disturbing. Of course, I can't fault them. \n[106]People are often frightened by what they don't understand. \n[107]And it is hard to understand, even for myself, for you see, Mother was so very beautiful. \n[108]How's your tea? \n[109]  \n[110]When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die? \n[111]Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time... \n[112]...Can you cure me? \n[113]I thought as much. \n[114]Come in. \n[115](bending over the model \n[116]Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you. \n[117]You don't think it's too gaudy, do you? \n[118]  \n[119]Night! \n[120]   \n[121]I must be more careful! \n[122]  \n[123]...Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home... it's cloudy out, I know, but remember; behind the clouds there is always the sun. \n[124]  \n[125]Please, come in. \n[126]...my... home? \n[127]You did this for me? \n[128]Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness. \n[129](trying the words on for size \n[130]Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves. \n[131]Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends. \n[132]   \n[133]   \n[134]Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very, VERY pleased to meet you! \n[135]Bytes! \n[136]...Alright. \n[137]   \n[138] \n[139]Bytes... please! \n[140]Bytes! Bytes, please!! \n[141]\n[142]y-y-yes-- \n[143]You're English. \n[144]Yes. \n[145]But... but... \n[146]Thank you, my friends. \n[147]Oh no, my friend... \n[148]Oh, yes. \n[149] \n[150]Mr. Treves! Treves. \n[151]  \n[152]You women are such strange and wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and everyone of you. I especially wish you could all be with me tonight... I'm finally going to the theatre. \n[153]...The theatre... \n[154]Oh no, I couldn't. \n[155] \n[156]   \n[157]Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't blame the King for wanting to marry her. \n[158]Yes, very soon. \n[159]Oh yes! It was wonderful! \n[160]Mr. Treves? \n[161]Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see? \n[162]Then I shouldn't change anything? \n[163]...I'll walk you to the door. \n[164]You too, my friend. Goodnight. \n[165]It is finished. \n[166]John... Merrick! \n[167]When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? \n[168]When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? \n[169]When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? \n[170]When will the heart be aweary of beating.... \n[171]...and nature die?

", "Kendal": "\n[1]Good day, Mr. Merrick. \n[2]I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward. \n[3]I knew you'd understand. Here. \n[4]I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone. \n[5]She's very pretty, your mother. \n[6]Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there. \n[7]You've never been? \n[8]Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial. \n[9]It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance. \n[10]That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you... \n[11]Have you read it? \n[12]Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss. \n[13]Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. \n[14]Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all... \n[15]Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. \n[16]It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box. \n[17]Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead. \n[18]How awful for John. \n[19]Is he... dying then? \n[20]Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite... \n[21]Thank you for your warm greeting. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's performance was very special to me, because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre and loves the theatre, and yet tonight is the first time he's ever actually been here. I would like to dedicate... the whole company wishes to dedicate, from their hearts, tonight's performance to Mr. John Merrick, my dear friend.

Shall we go in? \n[6]How do you do? \n[7]Sit still. Don't wiggle about like a pup. I won't stand for any foolishness. \n[8]The workhouse. \n[9]Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten? \n[10]Won't come out, eh? \n[11]Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it. \n[12]Alright, my son, none of this fuss. Come up from there, this instant. \n[13]Honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. All he understands is a good smack. \n[14]Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir. \n[15]Patients here are not \"its\". They are either \"he's\" or \"she's\", but that's alright, Ireland. This one's going to be more work for all of us. Good God girl! Mind your broth. \n[16]Good Lord, Mr. Treves! \n[17]Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here. \n[18]Read it. \n[19]Credit where credit is due. You'll have the paper every morning at breakfast. \n[20]Well, I think I can safely hand the duties over to you girls now. Mr. Merrick will require a bath every day... that way he won't pong quite so much. Nora, you can instruct Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. Merrick's bath. You'll be on your own tomorrow. \n[21]Don't look so glum girls. Such enthusiastic volunteers should be more cheerful. \n[22]Oh, and girls, under no circumstances are there to be any mirrors brought into this room. \n[23] \n[24]Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you. \n[25]I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir. \n[26]But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends. \n[27]I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it. \n[28]If you ask me, sir, he's just being stared at all over again. \n[29]Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick. \n[30]Yes sir. What's that? \n[31]Very smart indeed. \n[32]A dressing bag? \n[33]Well... \n[34]A dressing bag? \n[35]Is this all there is for John? \n[36]What is it? What is it? \n[37]Welcome home, John. \n[38]Good God... John? \n[39]Done. \n[40]There's a policeman to see you, Sir. "}}
