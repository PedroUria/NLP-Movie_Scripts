They won't tell me anything. \n[7]How long? \n[8]Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... \n[9]No...noooo! \n[10] \n[11]We made it, Jones.  We made it. \n[12] \n[13]Have they located my daughter yet? \n[14]Is she...? \n[15]Amy. \n[16]I promised her I'd be home for her birthday.  Her eleventh birthday.  I sure missed that one. Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway. \n[17]You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can. \n[18]You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. \n[19]I get the picture. \n[20]  \n[21]Do you people have earwax, of what?  We have been here three hours.  How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story? \n[22]Look, I told you... \n[23]Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it? \n[24]  \n[25]I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon... \n[26]Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... \n[27](louder, stepping on him \n[28]That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye. \n[29]They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. \n[30]  \n[31] \n[32]What are you talking about. What people? \n[33]How many colonists? \n[34] \n[35]  \n[36]  \n[37]No.  There's no way! \n[38]I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it. \n[39] \n[40]Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial. \n[41] \n[42] \n[43]If I go. \n[44] \n[45] \n[46]Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. \n[47]All right.  I'm in. \n[48]And you my dear, are staying right here. \n[49]You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not? \n[50]Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight? \n[51]I've dictated what I know on these. \n[52]Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It's essentially a walking sex organ. The -- \n[53]  \n[54]Yes? \n[55] \n[56]I hope you're right.  I really do. \n[57]I feel like a fifth wheel here.  Is there anything I can do? \n[58] \n[59]Where you want it? \n[60]How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? \n[61]That the atmosphere processor? \n[62]The structure seems intact.  They have power. \n[63]You bet. \n[64]Wait!  Tell him to... ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There! \n[65] \n[66]Christ, Wierzbowski! \n[67] \n[68]Watch it, Burke... \n[69]  \n[70]One of us? \n[71] \n[72]It's okay, it's okay.  It's over... you're going to be all right now... it's okay...you're safe... \n[73] \n[74]Here, try this.  A little instant hot chocolate. \n[75] \n[76]Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing. \n[77]Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that. \n[78]I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca. \n[79]What did you say? \n[80]Well, Newt it is then.  My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley. \n[81]Pleased to meet you.  And who is this?  Does she have a name? \n[82]What about me? \n[83]Why not? \n[84]Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they? \n[85] \n[86]Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise. \n[87]Cross my heart. \n[88] \n[89]The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts? \n[90]You're really something, ace. \n[91]I don't know. \n[92] \n[93]And the colonists...When they were done with them. Newt, you better go sit up front.  Go on. \n[94]They're right under the primary heat exchangers. \n[95]That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. \n[96]So...then the fusion containment shuts down. \n[97] \n[98] \n[99] \n[100] \n[101]Newt?  Where's Newt? \n[102]You okay? \n[103]Looks like it stung him. \n[104]You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. \n[105] \n[106]Why not? \n[107]They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second? \n[108]Bullshit! \n[109]Look, Burke.  We had an agreement. \n[110]You son of a bitch. \n[111]What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. \n[112]This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right? \n[113]We're going home, honey. \n[114]Run! \n[115]I'm sorry, Newt. \n[116]How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? \n[117]She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training. \n[118]So you better just start dealing with it.  Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place.  I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements.  Every possible way into this wing. \n[119]Fine.  You do that. \n[120]This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. \n[121]All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door. \n[122]That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here. \n[123](strapping it on \n[124]Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted. \n[125]I'll bet Casey doesn't have bad dreams. \n[126]Nothing bad in here.  Maybe you could just try to be like her. \n[127]Oh.  Sorry, Newt. \n[128] \n[129]Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. \n[130]I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth. \n[131]No, it's different, honey. \n[132]Yes.  A little girl. \n[133] \n[134]I think it's not the worst idea I've heard all day.  Let's talk about it later. \n[135]I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there. \n[136]Here.  Take is for luck.  Now go to sleep...and don't dream. \n[137] \n[138]Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those... \n[139]Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least. \n[140]But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from. \n[141]You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs? \n[142]Could it be intelligent? \n[143] \n[144]Burke! \n[145]You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code. \n[146]But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here -- \n[147] \n[148]You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them? \n[149]Bad call?  These people are fucking dead, Burke!  Well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and I'll be there when they do. \n[150]Sorry to disappoint you. \n[151]They're at the fire door. \n[152]How long until it blows? \n[153]And it's too late to shut it down? \n[154] \n[155] \n[156]What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that? \n[157]Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually. \n[158]What? \n[159]All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need? \n[160]It's going to be closer.  You better get going. \n[161] \n[162]Now many? \n[163]They retreated.  The guns stopped them. \n[164]But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile. \n[165] \n[166]Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that? \n[167]What do I do? \n[168]What's this? \n[169]Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself. \n[170]How do you feel? \n[171]Forget it. \n[172]There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right. \n[173]   \n[174] \n[175] \n[176] \n[177]Hicks!  Hicks! \n[178]I know, honey.  Me too. \n[179] \n[180]He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine.  But if we were impregnated ...whatever you call it...and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt. \n[181]The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked. \n[182] \n[183]Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to -- \n[184]They cut the power. \n[185]Newt!  Stay close. Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch Burke. \n[186] \n[187]Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez? \n[188]Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations. \n[189] \n[190] \n[191]They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed. \n[192]I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know! \n[193]They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing? \n[194]Can't be.  That's inside the room! \n[195]Medical!  Get to medical! \n[196]Burke!  Open the door! \n[197] \n[198]Stay behind me. \n[199]DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? \n[200]Back.  Go back! \n[201]Newt, wait! \n[202]Newt! \n[203] \n[204] \n[205]Climb down, honey.  We have to cut through this grate. \n[206]Newt!  Newt! \n[207]No!  Noooo! \n[208]No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to -- \n[209]Come on, you can make it. Almost there. \n[210]\n[211]\n[212]She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it. \n[213]Hicks, don't let him leave. \n[214]See you, Hicks. \n[215]Ellen. \n[216]Here. \n[217]Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight. \n[218]\n[219] \n[220] \n[221]Punch it, Bishop! \n[222]It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's over. \n[223]You did okay, Bishop. \n[224] \n[225]Here! \n[226]Get away from her, you bitch! \n[227] \n[228]Right here, baby.  Right here. \n[229]That's right. \n[230]Yes, honey.  I think we both can. ", "Vasquez": "\n[1] \n[2]No.  Have you? \n[3]Who's the fresh meat again? \n[4]I only need to know one thing. \n[5]Where they are. \n[6]Anytime.

You know. \n[36]They're coming.  They're in the tunnel. \n[37]Guns A and B.  Tracking and firing on multiple targets. \n[38]B gun's dry.  Twenty on A. Ten.  Five.  That's it. \n[39]We got problems. \n[40]Well, they're into the complex. \n[41] \n[42]Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen.  C and D guns down about fifty percent. \n[43]Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out. \n[44]Yeah.  But look... \n[45]Newt time then can walk right up and knock. \n[46](to Vasquez and Hudson \n[47]How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours? \n[48]Maybe.  Maybe not. \n[49]If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine. \n[50]M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump-action grenade launcher. \n[51]Just pull it in real right.  It will kick some.  When the counter here heads zero, hit this... \n[52]Just let it drop right out.  Get the other one in quick.  Just slap it in hard, it likes abuse. Now, pull the bolt. \n[53]You're ready again. \n[54]Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. \n[55]Yeah.  I've noticed. \n[56]  \n[57]Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in medical!  We got a fire! \n[58]The corner!  Ready? \n[59] \n[60]Wait a minute.  We'd know about it. \n[61]  \n[62] \n[63]Let's get these things lit. \n[64]We didn't miss anything. \n[65]Well you're not reading it right! \n[66]  \n[67]    \n[68]Fuckin' A! \n[69] \n[70]Stand back. \n[71] \n[72] \n[73]All right, stand by there.  We're on out way.  Over. \n[74]This way.  We're close... \n[75] \n[76]All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now! \n[77](grimacing with pain \n[78]Dwayne.  It's Dwayne. \n[79](nods with satisfaction ", "Newt": "\n[1]And half mine! \n[2]Daddy, when are we going back to town? \n[3]You always say that.  I wanna go back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.' \n[4]Do not.  I'm just the best. \n[5]So!  That's why I'm the best. \n[6]Mom.  All the kids play it... \n[7]Timmy...they've been gone a long time. \n[8]  \n[9]N-newt. \n[10]Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother. \n[11]Casey.  She's my only friend. \n[12]I don't want you for a friend. \n[13]Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone. \n[14] \n[15]You promise? \n[16]And hope to die? \n[17]I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze. \n[18]Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody. \n[19]I guess we're not leaving, right? \n[20]You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault. \n[21]We should get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon.  They come mostly at night.  Mostly. \n[22] \n[23]I don't want to...I have scary dreams. \n[24]Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. \n[25]My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are. \n[26]Why do they tell little kids that? \n[27]Did one of those things grow inside her? \n[28]Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you? \n[29]Did you ever have a baby? \n[30]Where is she? \n[31]You mean dead. \n[32]Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her.  Just for a while.  You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand.  No big deal. Whattya think? \n[33]Don't go!  Please. \n[34]Wah...?  Where are...? \n[35]Mommy...mommmyyyyy... \n[36]Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. \n[37]Look! \n[38]Come on!  This way. \n[39]Come on.  Crawl faster. \n[40]Sure.  Go left. \n[41]Go right. \n[42]This way.  Come on, we're almost there! \n[43]Here!  Go up. \n[44]Just up there -- \n[45]Riiiiipppleee -- \n[46] \n[47] \n[48]Here!  I'm here.  I'm here. \n[49] \n[50] \n[51]Are we going to sleep now? \n[52]Can we dream? ", "Bishop": "\n[1]I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley. \n[2]I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem? \n[3]I'm shocked.  Was it an older model? \n[4]Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being. More cornbread? \n[5] \n[6]I'll be in medical.  I'd like to continue my analysis. \n[7]I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon. \n[8]Yes.  That follows. \n[9]That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. \n[10]Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society. \n[11]Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course. \n[12]Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific. \n[13] \n[14]That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting. \n[15]I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons. \n[16]I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point. \n[17]I checked.  The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting. \n[18] \n[19]I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. \n[20]This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly.  One hundred eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes to crawl down there.  One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time. \n[21] \n[22] \n[23](voice over; static \n[24](yelling; over enunciating \n[25]\n[26]Ripley... \n[27]In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. \n[28]  \n[29]   \n[30]I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical. \n[31]I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable... \n[32]I had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off. \n[33]Well, thanks, I -- \n[34]Not bad for a human.

Rough air ahead. \n[6](voice over; filtered \n[7]Turning on final.  Coming around to a seven-zero-niner.  Terminal guidance locked in.  Where's the damn beacon? \n[8] \n[9]Spunkmeyer?

My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years. \n[3]You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right? \n[4]Sorry...I've been running behind all morning. \n[5]Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest... \n[6]  \n[7] \n[8] \n[9]Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys... \n[10]Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. \n[11]You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. \n[12] \n[13]Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the... \n[14]Ripley we have to talk. They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron. \n[15]Hear me out... \n[16]Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all. \n[17]These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? \n[18]Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' \n[19]I heard you were working in the cargo docks. \n[20]Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? \n[21]What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? \n[22]If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... \n[23]Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... \n[24]Think about it. \n[25] \n[26]That's the plan.  My word on it. \n[27]Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. \n[28]A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved. \n[29]Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2. \n[30] \n[31]  \n[32]Still nothing from the colony? \n[33]Here we go. \n[34]Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way. \n[35]Looks like my room in college. \n[36]Hmm.  Acid for blood. \n[37] \n[38]Are these the same...? \n[39]These are dead.  There's just the two alive. \n[40] \n[41]Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... \n[42] \n[43]We're talking thermonuclear explosion. \n[44]Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action. \n[45]Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- \n[46]This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- \n[47]I know, I know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here.  This thing is major, Ripley.  I mean really major.  You gotta go with its energy.  Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money. \n[48] \n[49]Corporal Hicks!? \n[50]Look, this is a multimillion dollar operation.  He can't make that kind of decision.  He's just a grunt! No offense. \n[51]This is absurd!  You don't have the authority to -- \n[52] \n[53]Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life. \n[54]You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. \n[55]Now, wait a second -- \n[56]Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing. \n[57]It was a bad call, that's all. \n[58] \n[59] \n[60]This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful. \n[61]Ripley...help me.  I can feel it...inside.  Oh, God...it's moving!  Oh gooood... "}}
