I'm actually doing my first on-air interview today. \n[123]Matthew Fox. \n[124]Yeah. \n[125]What? \n[126]No. \n[127]I hope a lot of people actually because that's what my job entails, is making sure people care about what he has to say. I'm interviewing him. \n[128]It's sort of embarrassing to ask at this point, but what do you do for work? \n[129]Oh, cool, what is it? \n[130]Mary Tyler Moore? \n[131]I do. \n[132]  \n[133]Really. \n[134]  \n[135]I actually need to get going, so. \n[136]I'm gonna give you my card because that'll be the best way... \n[137]All right then.

Yeah, just, what about the comic books? Keep talking. \n[146]Shut up. \n[147]You're an asshole. \n[148]I don't need to see it again. It's gonna make me throw up. \n[149]You're such an asshole. \n[150]Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this out and we can re-- \n[151]--we can reshoot my questions. \n[152]Oh my god. Oh my god. \n[153]I don't know. \n[154]I haven't eaten today yet. \n[155]Do you have a napkin or something? \n[156]I don't know. \n[157]It's impossible. You have to have sex to get pregnant. \n[158]Oh, shit. \n[159]No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That was what, eight weeks ago? \n[160]No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't know. I can't remember. I was, I mean, I've been really stressed at work. I can't remember my last period. \n[161]Can you not joke right now? Don't joke right now. This is really serious. \n[162]Yeah. You know, he was kind of like medium height, sort of...chubby. Blonde, curly hair. Remember? \n[163]Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on my phone. \n[164]Oh, shit. \n[165]Okay. \"Positive Choice.\" \n[166]Here. Hurry up now. Come on. \n[167]Get more!

ALISON  (cont'd) Right? \n[173]Shit. \n[174]Maybe I don't need to call him until after I see the doctor. \n[175]I don't want to call him. I don't need to call him. \n[176]I can't call him anyway. He doesn't even have a phone. He didn't even have a number to give me. \n[177]Said some kind of billing issue. \n[178]Shit, you're right. I got to call. I don't know. I'm gonna have to look him up on his stupid website. \n[179]Just go to \"Contact Us.\" \n[180]Yeah. \n[181]Yep. \n[182]Yeah. \n[183] Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know if you remember me. \n[184] I actually was just wondering if maybe you, wanted to get together, like tomorrow night? \n[185] Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night? You wanna just grab some dinner? \n[186] Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more like six, though? I'd like to keep it early. \n[187] Okay. I'll just meet you there, then, at six. \n[188]Oh, shit. \n[189]It's really nice. \n[190]That's okay. \n[191]Thanks. Yeah, I just thought, I don't know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to hang out a little bit and... We didn't really get to talk much last time so I \n[192]I thought maybe we'd just talk and get to know each other...better. \n[193]That's cool. \n[194]So the web page is it just something that you guys do for fun? Do you have a real job? \n[195]Oh. \n[196]So, how do you...? \n[197]Right. \n[198]Oh, my God. \n[199]Right. \n[200]Yeah. So, I have something I really need to tell you. It's kind of why I called you. Here it goes. I'm pregnant. \n[201]What? \n[202]I'm pregnant...? \n[203]With a baby. You're the father. \n[204]Yes! \n[205]I don't know. I thought you were wearing a condom. \n[206]What? \n[207]Why not? \n[208]What are you talking about? \n[209]I did not tell you not to wear a condom. \n[210]I didn't mean do it without a condom. I mean \"do it\" like \"hurry up,\" like \"get fucking going!\" \n[211]What the hell is a dental dam? \n[212]Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't tell that you didn't have one on! Obviously, I was drunk! \n[213]You are unbelievable. \n[214]I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist. \n[215]No. \n[216]Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure. \n[217]Yeah, yeah. Come on. \n[218]Yes. \n[219]Alison. \n[220]Good. \n[221]I took a home pregnancy test and it said I was pregnant, so here we are. \n[222]That, that's it? \n[223]Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a while. I have a while before I have to say anything. \n[224]Well, they're not gonna know. I mean, I'm only gonna start to show when I'm like, I don't know, six months or something. Seven months. \n[225]No. \n[226]Debbie didn't get fat. \n[227]Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive. \n[228]Hi, Ben? \n[229]Good, good. You know, I was just calling to, let you know that, I've decided to keep the baby.That's what's happening with that. \n[230]Yeah, yeah, it is good. \n[231]I really appreciate you saying that. \n[232]I have no idea either. \n[233]Yeah, sure. \n[234]Yeah. \n[235]Hi. \n[236]Thank you. \n[237]Hi. \n[238]Yes. \n[239]Thank you. \n[240]Thank you. \n[241]She's good. \n[242]Okay. \n[243]Hi. \n[244]Hi. \n[245]No. \n[246]Eh, no. I'm good. \n[247]Hi. \n[248]Yeah, hi. \n[249]Mm-hm. \n[250]I don't know. \n[251]I'm okay right now. Thank you. \n[252]Right. \n[253]The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby. \n[254]If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years. \n[255]It's a beautiful picture, Ben. \n[256]With a little hint of Spanish. \n[257]Awesome. \n[258]What can we expect? \n[259]It sounds thrilling. \n[260]Yeah, thank you. \n[261]It's not that. \n[262]Okay, first of all, it's not my situation. It's our situation. \n[263]And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door. \n[264]I like you, too. \n[265]A little, so far. I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes. We don't have to rush it. \n[266]We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot. You know? We got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to. \n[267]Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do? \n[268]You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that? \n[269]I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous. \n[270]You're a sweet guy, right? \n[271]Don't fuck me over, okay? \n[272]Okay. \n[273]He's my boyfriend. \n[274]He's a new boyfriend. \n[275]  \n[276]  \n[277]  \n[278]  \n[279]Shit. \n[280]  \n[281]No. \n[282]I have on occasion. \n[283]How ya doing? \n[284]No. \n[285]Boobs! Boobs! Boobs! \n[286]Boobs and bush. \n[287]Good boobs. \n[288]Right over the beginning credits. \n[289]I know. That's so crazy. \n[290]How many doctors are there in your practice? Just because I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience. I want to make sure that you're my doctor on the day and... \n[291]I feel really good about this. I think we found our doctor. \n[292]Yeah. \n[293]You're being dramatic. We didn't meet that many. \n[294]Pardon? \n[295]The doughnuts, they call to me. \n[296]Hi. \n[297]Thanks. \n[298]What? \n[299]Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad? I'm really chickening out about this. \n[300]Awesome. \n[301]Just don't say anything, okay? Please don't say anything. \n[302]Okay, come on! Let's go. \n[303]Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy. \n[304]We are that happy. \n[305]Which is awesome. Because I never like guys like you. It's great. \n[306]  \n[307]No. \n[308]No. It's too much. \n[309]It's so hot in the Valley. \n[310]Oh, shit. \n[311]Hi! \n[312]You too. Oh, my God. \n[313]Yeah, it's been super-exciting, just crazy busy. I'm so sorry I haven't called. \n[314]This is my friend, Ben. \n[315]It was a big surprise. \n[316]It's not really funny. \n[317]It's not funny. \n[318]All right. \n[319]   \n[320]  \n[321]I love you too. \n[322]But here's the thing. \n[323]I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks. \n[324]I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have. \n[325]I didn't hurt your feelings, did I? \n[326]I really do love you. \n[327]Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve. \n[328]He can't afford a ring. \n[329]Yes. \n[330]Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried. \n[331]I thought you should love people for who they are. \n[332]You don't think that's naggy? \n[333]Why do you say that? \n[334]Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that. \n[335]No. \n[336]No. I don't have to. It's illegal for them to fire me over it. And I get three months maternity leave if I stay. So I'm not going to tell them. \n[337]What do you mean? \n[338]No. What are you talking about? \n[339]I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about? \n[340]Come on, harder. \n[341]Why? Just do it deeper. \n[342]Why? \n[343]Just do it! \n[344]The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on! \n[345]That's ridiculous! \n[346]Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works! \n[347]Just get over it. \n[348]Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine. \n[349]I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins. \n[350]And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic. \n[351]No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog. \n[352]Yeah. \n[353]Harder. \n[354]Just go harder. \n[355]Keep going! \n[356]What happened? \n[357]It always kicks. \n[358]It's fine. \n[359]Just keep going. \n[360]It's fine! It's fine! \n[361]What are you talking about? \n[362]I have totally lost it now. \n[363]I've lost it. \n[364]Great, you know what? Just forget it. \n[365] Don't worry. I won't make you do this again. \n[366]Ben? \n[367]Ben! \n[368]  \n[369]Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high? \n[370]What is this? \n[371]  \n[372]Hey it's me. \n[373]Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her. \n[374]Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh. \n[375]Ben, come on. \n[376]How do you know? \n[377]Are you sure? \n[378]Are you really? \n[379]Why? \n[380]Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little? \n[381]No. I don't think so. \n[382]What? \n[383]Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating. \n[384]Stop it. \n[385]Yeah, come on. Let's go. \n[386]What? \n[387]Come on. \n[388]  \n[389]Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben. \n[390]I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is. \n[391]Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed. \n[392]What's funny about it? \n[393]Is that what you think? \n[394]Is that what you want to do, Ben? \n[395]Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man. \n[396]You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong! \n[397]Yes! \n[398]Oh, that's helpful. You have to do nothing! \n[399]You are just fucking sitting there! You haven't sacrificed anything! \n[400]I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina! \n[401]Yes! It will never look the same after this! \n[402]You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti. \n[403]You know what? Get out of the car. \n[404]You should just get out of the fucking car. \n[405]Get out of the car. \n[406]I own this car! Get out of my car! \n[407]Get out of my car! \n[408]  \n[409]You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge. \n[410]  \n[411]Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke! \n[412]Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books. \n[413]It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me! \n[414]If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. \n[415]But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves. \n[416]Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck! \n[417]I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate. \n[418]I don't feel so stupid, then. \n[419]  \n[420]What? \n[421]What are you doing? \n[422]I'm just so tired. \n[423]Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes. \n[424]How many Red Bulls have you had? \n[425]  \n[426]What's over? \n[427]Don't say that. \n[428]So dance. \n[429]I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and-- \n[430]Debbie, no, you're not. \n[431]Everything looks beautiful. \n[432]No, it's great. \n[433]I don't think so. I don't know why he would. \n[434]I just don't think we can make it work. \n[435]You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie. \n[436]She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas. \n[437]And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and... \n[438]We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be. \n[439]Yeah. I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry. \n[440]I'll be right back. We'll finish talking. \n[441]I got two months. \n[442]Yeah. \n[443]I got two months to go. \n[444]Wow, wow. \n[445]Thanks, thanks. \n[446]You know what? \n[447]You don't need to lie to me. I don't appreciate it. I know I look like a fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely. \n[448]Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an interview, please. \n[449]You know what? Just say into the camera, \"You're watching E! Entertainment.\" Just give me that. \n[450]No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on. \n[451]Shut up, Brent. \n[452]   \n[453]I'm really sorry. \n[454]I just wasn't expecting this and, I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't want to lose my job. I'm really sorry. \n[455]Really? \n[456]Oh, my God! \n[457]Really? \n[458]Oh, my God. This is such good news. Thank you so much. \n[459]Okay. I won't.

Can you give me his number? \n[468]No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my own doctor. You really won't give me his number? Because this is my first baby and he promised that he would be here for me and I need you to give me his number, okay? \n[469]No, I don't want you to help me because I have no idea who you are! I want my own goddamned doctor! You make sure he calls me! \n[470]   \n[471]  \n[472]Ben? \n[473]Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about. Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life. So just...just be calm. \n[474]I don't want to talk about it. \n[475]No. I don't want to go there. Don't go there, okay? \n[476]Help me stay relaxed. \n[477]You need to call Dr. Howard. \n[478]Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. \n[479]No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong. \n[480]Let's just drop it now.

That was really sweet of you. \n[494]Is that the baby on that one right there? \n[495]Okay. \n[496]Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs. \n[497]Oh, yeah, get in there. \n[498]What was that? \n[499]Oh, my God. \n[500]No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan. \n[501]What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable with that. I'm not. \n[502]Whatever. Do what you have to do. \n[503] Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is. \n[504]I'm so sorry I broke up with you. \n[505]I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat. \n[506]It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me. \n[507]I guess he is. \n[508]I know. \n[509]Screw Legoland. \n[510]No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great. \n[511]Debbie. \n[512]Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit, this really hurts! \n[513]I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural! \n[514]Okay? \n[515]No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time! \n[516]Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing. \n[517]I'll stop, oh, please, please, please! \n[518]Okay. \n[519]I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening. \n[520]Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me? \n[521]Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben? \n[522]What? \n[523]No, I want to see it! \n[524]No, I want to see... \n[525]...it! Oh, God!

Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby? \n[17]Where do babies come from? \n[18]Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby. \n[19]Where have you been? \n[20]Why is everybody so mad at you? \n[21]They've been saying, like \"blah-blah- blah-blah. Ben's a prick.\" \n[22]A lot. \n[23]What does it mean? \n[24]Oh. Penis. ", "Jill": "\n[1]Alison? \n[2]Jack and I need to see you in his office. \n[3]They decided that they like you. And they would like to put you on camera. \n[4]I know. I was so surprised, too. \n[5]It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see what happens. It's going to be tough. Tough job. \n[6]We can't legally ask you to do that. \n[7]No. \n[8]Just like toned and smaller. \n[9]We don't want you to lose weight. We just want you to be healthy. \n[10]You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty. \n[11]And then weigh that much. \n[12]Hey, Alison! \n[13]Great job. \n[14]  \n[15]This is Hollywood. We don't like liars. \n[16]Yeah. \n[17]I was surprised because I feel the opposite. \n[18]Scary! \n[19]It just grosses me out...when I know that people are pregnant. Because I think about the birth. Everything's so wet. \n[20]Tight. And please don't lie to us again. Because maybe someday we could be friends. \n[21]I just don't like secrets. ", "Jason": "\n[1]All right? Now, are you sure you understand the terms of the bet? `Cause this is serious. \n[2]Martin, listen. You don't shave your beard or cut your hair for one year, and if you can do that, I will pay your rent. But if you shave, then you have to pay all five of our rents. \n[3]Just watch your back, Serpico. You never know who your friends are. \n[4]But, Martin, it's a competition. It's called \"The Dirty Man Competition.\" We're gonna make fun of you until you shave the beard. That's the rules. \n[5]Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when I was explaining the rules? You just looked at me with that blank stare of yours. It was like talking to a wax statue. \n[6]Nice. \n[7]Yeah, ka-ching. Ka-ching. Ka-ching. \n[8]   \n[9]Ohh!!! \n[10]What's up, daddy? \n[11]Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She looks...smart. Who's that she's sitting with? \n[12]Her sister? \n[13]Dude, it's the dream. What are we doin' standing here man? Let's go. Come on, follow me. You stay here. \n[14]`Cause your face looks like a vagina. \n[15]Hey, which one's the sister? \n[16]How ya doin'? \n[17]Just trying not to stare. \n[18]It's a shame. You're beautiful. \n[19]I love kids. \n[20]Yeah, absolutely. \n[21]I had the chicken pox three times. I have no immunity to it. \n[22]It's not herpes if it's everywhere. \n[23]Bye, lovely. \n[24]All right, I'm gonna let you two get to know each other. \n[25]Hey, Benjamin? \n[26]\"Flesh of the Stars\" just got an e- mail. \n[27]Would you like me to read it to you? \n[28]\"Ben, what is your number? I need to speak to you right away. Alison Scott\" BEN, JASON &amp; JONAH Ohhhhhh! \n[29]\"Looking forward to speaking with you.\" \n[30]Sent. \n[31]Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply of condoms if you weren't gonna use `em, man? \n[32]Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity. \n[33]What goes up must come down. \n[34]You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near the kid. He wants to rear your child! \n[35]I'm just kidding you. \n[36]I won't let him do it. \n[37]Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you remember. \n[38]You look beautiful. \n[39]Your body's responding really well to the pregnancy. \n[40]It's amazing how fast the milk arrives. How's your sis? \n[41]Oh, good. Tell her \"What's up\" for me. \n[42]All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake. \n[43]I have fifteen years of tennis lessons. \n[44]You know who I'd like to get pregnant is that Felicity Huffman, man. Ever since \"Transamerica,\" I can't get her out of my mind. \n[45]I thought you went to Santa Monica City College. \n[46]I'll tell you what, man. We could probably get it online in three months. \n[47]Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman. \n[48]See ya, Ally. \n[49]Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes! Why didn't you think of that, Jay! \n[50]\"Spiderman Three\" starts in eight minutes. \n[51]You're fine, man. \n[52]Take it easy. \n[53]Did anybody turn off the gas? \n[54]Oh, motherfucker. \n[55]Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry. \n[56]Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities. \n[57]  \n[58]Hey, what's up daddy? What are you doing? \n[59]I think we're about to go to a new club. You coming? \n[60]   \n[61]  \n[62]  \n[63]  \n[64]  \n[65]  \n[66]  \n[67]No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb? \n[68]You all right, buddy? \n[69]What's up Deb? \n[70]You want out of the bet? \n[71]You know what you have to say. Just say it, man. I think now is the time. \n[72]You heard it, right? \n[73]All right. You're out of the bet. You're done. \n[74]Your face smells like an old man's balls. \n[75]Congratulations, Daddy! \n[76]Let's meet her. Aw. ", "Jay": "\n[1]That's the whole point.

Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again. \n[16]Tell me you don't want him to get an \"A word.\" \n[17]Ben, you cannot let these monsters have any part of your child's life. All right? I'm gonna be there to rear your child. \n[18]Oh, great. Now he's upset. \n[19]Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit. \n[20]You're embarrassing me in company! \n[21]Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening! \n[22]  \n[23]You think she likes you? \n[24]She's entertaining the idea of liking you. \n[25]Wll, see she's bringing you to the gynechiatrist. She must like you. \n[26]Geez. \n[27]Are you sure you don't want to come paint-balling? \n[28]All right. \n[29]Bye. \n[30]Don't put this on me! \n[31]For sure. \n[32]Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl. \n[33]We're golden. \n[34]Oh my God!

I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere. \n[40]What? \n[41]Just relax, man, just relax. \n[42]Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby. \n[43]Jesus. \n[44]Jesus. \n[45]No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do. \n[46]You okay in here? \n[47]Jesus! \n[48]Yeah, okay. \n[49]One sec. \n[50]I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't go in there.

Let's say you like her so much, you want to know every movie where she shows her tits. And not just that, but how long into that movie she shows her tits. Come to our web page, exclusively, type in `Meg Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight minutes in, forty-eight minutes in, like an hour and ten minutes in. She's like naked that whole fuckin' movie. She does full-frontal in that movie. \n[98]They should have called her Harry, not Sally. \n[99]I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush. \n[100]Cool. \n[101]Awesome.

What's up? \n[120] I've been meaning to call you so we could hook up again. You know what I'm sayin'? \n[121] Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good. What do you say Geisha House, Hollywood, nine o'clock? \n[122] Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah, leave more time for afterwards. Dessert. Sweet. \n[123] I'll see you there. Take care. Peace. \n[124]I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers! \n[125]Nice place, huh? \n[126]Sorry it took so long to get a table. I didn't realize you needed a reservation. \n[127]You look very pretty, though. \n[128]That we didn't. \n[129]Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian. \n[130]From Vancouver. I live here illegally, actually. Don't tell anyone. But it works out in my advantage, ultimately, `cause I don't have to pay any taxes. So financially that's helpful `cause I don't have a lot of money. I'm not poor or anything but I eat a lot of spaghetti. \n[131]Well, that is our job. \n[132]We don't technically get money for the hours we put in, but it is our job. \n[133]How do I pay rent and shit? \n[134]When I was in high school, I got ran over by a postal truck. \n[135]It was my foot more than anything. But, I got fourteen grand from the British Columbia government. \n[136]And that really lasted me until now. It's been almost ten years. I have like nine hundred bucks left. So that should last me for I'm not a mathematician, but like another two years or some shit...I think. \n[137]Fuck off. \n[138]What? \n[139]With emotion? \n[140]I'm the father. \n[141]How the fuck could this happen? \n[142]No. \n[143]I wasn't. \n[144]Because you told me not to. \n[145]What am I talking about? You told me not to. \n[146]Here's what happened, okay? I will give you a play-by-play of my memory. I almost had the condom on my dick. It was on the cusp and then you said, \"Just do it, already.\" \n[147]Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch, or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin' butterfly clips or something like that. \n[148]It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting, okay? But I thought you had one. Why the fuck didn't you stop me once we started? \n[149]Was your vagina drunk? Did you think it's the thinnest condom on earth I have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed out a penis and put it on? What the fuck?! \n[150]Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've reacted unfavorably. So what happens now? I don't know how this works. \n[151]So you haven't seen him, though? \n[152]So you don't know if you're pregnant. \n[153]You're not a hundred percent sure. I bet you're not pregnant. \n[154]I'm supposed to go? \n[155]I'm Ben Stone. \n[156]Nice office. \n[157]Oh, God. It's okay. \n[158]  \n[159]You happy about that? \n[160]This is a disaster. \n[161]It is, you know? \n[162]I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it. \n[163]I am kinda living my vision, yeah. \n[164]Okay. \n[165]I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll feel like a hypocrite. \n[166]What did you say? \n[167]That's right, that's right. \n[168]I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time. \n[169]Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know? \n[170]I'm the best thing that ever happened to you? \n[171]Now I just feel bad for you. \n[172]  \n[173]Hello? \n[174]Hey Alison, how's it goin'? \n[175]Good. That's good. That's what I was hoping you'd do. So, awesome. \n[176]I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know? You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do. I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do. \n[177]I'm on board. Yaaay. \n[178]No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever. \n[179]Do you want to, like, get together and talk about it or something like that? \n[180]Like a date? I mean... \n[181]   \n[182]  \n[183] \n[184]You look beautiful. \n[185]No problem. Come on in. \n[186]Everyone, this is Alison. \n[187]And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah. \n[188]Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there. \n[189]I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a seat if you want. \n[190]All right. Let's go. See you guys later. \n[191]Yeah. \n[192]At least! God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me. I didn't think this would happen. \n[193]Get ready. This will be coming out of you in seven months. This is exactly what our baby will look like. \n[194]It is. It's not bad.  Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be French Canadian. I like that. \n[195]Exactly, I'm not good with accents. \n[196]Baby books. \n[197]\"What to Expect When You're Expecting.\" \n[198]Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You can't smoke crack. And you can't jump on trampolines. This is basically a giant list of things you can't do. \n[199]I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack. And you're not gonna have anything to do. You're gonna be bored. But I can't wait to read these, honestly. I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning. Do you want me to get you that? \n[200]No problem. These are heavy. \n[201]At least we don't have to use a condom, you know? BEN  (cont'd) But we can. I brought some just in case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I mean, I don't, I thought-- \n[202]It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know? \n[203]I know that. \n[204]I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's all this is. \n[205]Sweet. \n[206]Yeah. \n[207]For the baby, right? \n[208]B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so... \n[209]I can do that. I'm really nervous. \n[210]Yeah. \n[211]I think I am. \n[212]I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay? \n[213]I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone. \n[214]I'm Ben Stone. \n[215]But a boyfriend. \n[216]You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together. \n[217]Yeah, a baby. \n[218]I feed your bear the grass? Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass? Smoke it. \n[219]Fetch. All right, bring it back. \n[220]Go get it! Fetch! \n[221]All right! \n[222]Bring it back. \n[223]I'm gonna get you! \n[224]I'm gonna get you! Whoa! \n[225]They seem to love bubbles. \n[226]They're really going ape-shit. \n[227]They float. You can pop them. I mean, I get it. I get it. \n[228]That's sad. \n[229]Am I going to be okay, man? \n[230]Can I just have some? \n[231]  \n[232]I can't ref the next games, by the way. I got to go meet gynecologists with Alison. She doesn't like her gynecologist. \n[233]She's trying to. \n[234]Exactly. I'll take that. \n[235]That's pretty good, I think. \n[236]Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but it's kind of, uh, business meeting time. I need moolah. When do you think we can launch this site? \n[237]Seriously, guys, let's say I want to launch today. Let's start... let's use that as a jumping off point. Let's make this happen. What can we do? \n[238]I'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day. I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them. \n[239]Thank you. Yes! Three months. \n[240]I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here. \n[241] Slow down, man. You're making me look like a jackass. \n[242]We're not. \n[243]She's not single. She's just not married. \n[244]  \n[245]  \n[246]Have fun, guys. Seriously, watch the eyes. \n[247]I don't want to go. I swear to God. I want to see \"Breathless\" at the LACMA. \n[248]  \n[249]Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it. \n[250]Those are good ones! We're like thirty- five seconds in. \n[251]Nice. Credit bush. You never get opening-credit bush. \n[252]You got me. You got me. \n[253]Really? \n[254]Oh, my God. Are you serious right now? \n[255]I am very relieved. \n[256]I can't imagine meeting and more of you people. \n[257]It's okay. I didn't think she did, anyway. \n[258]Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is? \n[259]Yeah. You look happy. \n[260]You keep saying that. I know. \n[261]Nice. \n[262]Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred bucks. \n[263]There's one of these in an alley behind my house. We could just grab that. Just rub Purell all over it. \n[264] Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I mean don't insult the woman. She wants to get us a gift. \n[265]Want to buy me some new clothes? What else can I squeeze out of you? \n[266]I'm Ben. \n[267]No. Alison is. \n[268]It's a really funny story, actually, if you guys, if you got a second to hear it. \n[269]Let them be the judge, okay? I think it's funny. \n[270]You know they say don't drink and drive? \n[271]Don't drink and bone! \n[272]Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her. She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that. \n[273]You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that? \n[274]How much do wedding rings cost? \n[275]That'll be easy. I don't make any money. \n[276]God, it's not porn? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies. \n[277]Who's Mister Skin? \n[278]  \n[279]This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen? \n[280]God damn it! \n[281]All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already. \n[282]You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs. \n[283]\"Volcano,\" \"Dante's Peak.\" \"Deep Impact,\" \"Armageddon.\" \"Wyatt Earp,\" \"Tombstone.\" \n[284]Exactly. We can work together. This helps us, if anything. \n[285]Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you. \n[286]Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me. \n[287]There's a thing? \n[288]Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts. \n[289]That makes sense. \n[290]No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally cool. \n[291]I know. Thanks. You mentioned that. It's nice. \n[292]It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes. (impersonating Robert De \n[293](impersonating Robert De \n[294]I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about... \n[295]...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that. \n[296]It was a flash! \n[297]Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, \"Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?\" No part of you would think, \"Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?\" You never got that flash? \n[298]You wouldn't do that? \n[299]Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine. \n[300]This is my time machine! \n[301]   \n[302]This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time. \n[303]   \n[304]  \n[305]I can't. \n[306]I can't. \n[307]I'll poke the baby if I go deeper. \n[308]Please don't yell at me. \n[309]I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby. \n[310]No, it's not. It has no shell. \n[311]I weigh over 200 pounds. \n[312]I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis. \n[313]You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny. \n[314]  \n[315]I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. \n[316]Here we go. Is it good? \n[317]Should I go slower? \n[318]Just tell me when you're close. \n[319]Okay. \n[320]Oh, God. Oh, fuck! \n[321]The baby. It kicked my hand. \n[322]No, no, no, no, no. \n[323]Not like this. No, this was a warning kick. \n[324]This was a bad kick. \n[325]Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see. \n[326]It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird. \n[327]You've totally lost it? \n[328]Okay. \n[329]Shit. \n[330]  \n[331]  \n[332]  \n[333]Fuck me. \n[334]Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no! \n[335]  \n[336]Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay? \n[337]You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the cops. \n[338]California. Hey! \n[339]   \n[340]You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, \"Don't move to Northridge.\" But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? \n[341]It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. \n[342]  \n[343]Hello? \n[344]You! \n[345]Really? \n[346]Oh, man. I don't want to do that. \n[347]He's not cheating on her. \n[348]I just know. \n[349]I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating. \n[350]No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat. \n[351]Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome? \n[352]Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls. \n[353]They really aren't good, man. \n[354]If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP. \n[355]That's true. \n[356]You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious. \n[357]  \n[358]Oh, great. \n[359]Looks like no one's home. \n[360]I just feel bad for Pete. \n[361]I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this. \n[362] Pete! \n[363]I coughed. What do you want from me? \n[364]Thank you. \n[365]I told you. Can we get out of here, please? \n[366]I didn't hear anything. \n[367]  \n[368]  \n[369]Oh, shit, she's coming back. \n[370]How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has. \n[371]That's a little strong, I would say. \n[372]It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny. \n[373]Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation. \n[374]We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh. \n[375]Yeah. \n[376]I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from. \n[377]Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that? \n[378]So if you're wrong, I have to support it? \n[379]I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic? \n[380]I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this! \n[381]I have. \n[382]You've sacrificed your vagina? \n[383]Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery. \n[384]You're right. Fine! \n[385]Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?! \n[386]I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No! \n[387]No! \n[388]No. \n[389]No. \n[390]Can you let me back in the car, please? Have you calmed down? Did you take a breath? I have no clue where we are! \n[391]Fine. Go. Great. \n[392]Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't they? \n[393]I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little. \n[394]I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?! \n[395]That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" on the pyramid walls! I forgot about that! Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?! \n[396]Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to me! \n[397]You know what? I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, \"Fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!\" Fuck them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit! \n[398]I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for once. \n[399]I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No. \n[400]Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas. \n[401]Yeah. \n[402]  \n[403]Since when do we lock this fucking thing? Come on! \n[404]Holy crap! What happened? \n[405]What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something? \n[406]Yo. \n[407]Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye? \n[408]Well stay back, guys. I got to get my suit. \n[409]This is fun! \n[410]We make a good team, man. \n[411]She thinks she could train me? \n[412]She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off. \n[413]In front of a crowd, baby. \n[414]Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms? \n[415]I'm eating them. \n[416]You do?! No you don't. \n[417]Holy shit! \n[418]There it is, baby. \n[419]I love Vegas, man. \n[420]It's really amazing here. \n[421]Now that's how you get pink eye. \n[422]Have the mushrooms kicked in yet? \n[423]Ohhhhhh! \n[424]This was a great idea, man. \n[425]What are they going to do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. (imitating one of the \n[426]No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm freaking out right now, man! \n[427]The mushrooms are turning on me! \n[428]I am not your papa. \n[429]I can't deal with this shit, man! \n[430]This isn't funny. That guy has twelve kids. It's not funny. This is sick. This is a sick movie. That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. That's not funny. I got to turn this off. It's freaking me out. \n[431]Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here? \n[432]Get them out of here, man. This is too many chairs for one room. \n[433]The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. I don't like them. \n[434]It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them. \n[435]I should've read the baby books. \n[436]Because then it's real, you know? \n[437]Think they'll take us back? \n[438]All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me. \n[439]What? \n[440]You can't believe...that people love you? I love you, man! Debbie loves you! \n[441]You can't accept love? \n[442]Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? You can't accept it? \n[443]You can't accept pure love? You can't accept Debbie? She's chosen to give you her life. She's picked you as her life partner! But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love? \n[444]Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man. \n[445]You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home. \n[446]Oh, hey, what up dog? \n[447]Around. You know, just kind of doing my thing. \n[448]I don't know. Are they mad? What have they been saying? \n[449]They said that? \n[450]That sucks. \n[451]Penis. It means penis. \n[452]What's happening, man? \n[453]Hey, Debbie. \n[454]Good. How are you? \n[455]Well, that was fast, you pussy. \n[456]How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace? \n[457]Well played, sir. That was good. \n[458]Yeah, I was about to. \n[459]It's a doll. \n[460]We can get back on track and everything's going to be great. \n[461]But Debbie's happy. \n[462]I didn't do shrooms in Vegas. \n[463]I'm not that guy anymore. \n[464]If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con-- \n[465]Oh, shit. \n[466]It's okay. \n[467]Thanks for warning me, man. I just walking into a fucking buzz saw! She rejected me! Because you, for some insane reason, told Debbie that I did mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets mad because I smoke pot! \n[468]Now I'm upping it to fucking psychedelics! Thanks! \n[469]You know why she just rejected me? Because you're such a shitty husband, she thinks I'm going to turn into a shitty husband! \n[470]  \n[471]You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said everything was going to be fine and nothing is fine. Nothing is fine. \n[472]Because you were the only one giving me advice! And it was, it was terrible advice! \n[473]I don't know how to take responsibility for myself, okay? I didn't read the baby books! \n[474]I should smoke less pot. I don't know what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell me what to do! \n[475]Just tell me what to do. \n[476]Best job I ever had. \n[477]  \n[478]   \n[479]   \n[480]  \n[481]Hello? \n[482]  \n[483]  \n[484]Just smoking a joint, drinking some beers, you know. Rocking. \n[485]No. I'm going to pack it in soon. \n[486]I know. I'm just tired. \n[487]No, I feel great. I like it. \n[488]No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you. \n[489]Okay, very good. \n[490]Great. \n[491]  \n[492]Hello? \n[493]Ben feverishly drives to Alison. \n[494]  \n[495]Hello? \n[496]Please be in here. Hello? Hello! \n[497]Hello? Alison. Hello? \n[498]Alison. What is this, like a water birth? What are we doing? Should we go? \n[499]  \n[500]But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so, we can talk-- \n[501]Okay. \n[502]So, what should I do? \n[503]Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency. \n[504]He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back? \n[505]Do you have his cell number, by any chance? \n[506]  \n[507]I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it. \n[508]It's okay. I didn't \n[509]I'm going to call him right now. You're doing so great. \n[510] Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling. Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here. Now, where are you? You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit! And you know I'm going to have to do now? I'm going to have to kill you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac! You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit! I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes. Peace, fucker! \n[511]Hey. \n[512]I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though. What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad. You should know that going in. We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine. Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine? \n[513]Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar Mitzvah. \n[514]It's a Jewish rite of passage. And he's going to be there for the next three days, so he will not be able to be here tonight. \n[515]I know exactly what to do. All we do is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to the hospital, and on the way, we will call every gynecologist we've met. Someone will be available. You know? \n[516]Good. We still have time. I mean, how far apart are your contractions? \n[517]Seven minutes! See? Not until four minutes is it really coming. And has your water broken, even? \n[518]That's a good point. Have you had, have you had your bloody show? \n[519]It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it only comes out right before the baby's going to come, so if that hasn't happened, we have time. We can make it to the hospital. It's no problem. \n[520]Yeah. I did. I read three of them, actually. \n[521]You're welcome. \n[522]It's okay. \n[523]I stole this from Martin's grandma. \n[524]Thanks. \n[525]  \n[526]You're our nurse? \n[527]We really, really appreciate you coming, man. \n[528]He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though. \n[529]Yeah. \n[530]Is that good? \n[531]I could do this all day. \n[532]What the hell was that? \n[533]What's that, what's happening? \n[534]It's going to be okay.  Is it going to be fine? \n[535]What are you doing? \n[536]What? \n[537]No. Would you please just listen to her? \n[538]Whoa, whoa, whoa, what? \n[539]No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want. \n[540]Can we talk outside in the hall for a second? \n[541]Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience. \n[542]Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her. \n[543]I think so. \n[544]Thank you, man. \n[545]I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now. \n[546]You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know? \n[547]No, no. \n[548]Me neither. \n[549]  \n[550]I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you. \n[551]Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off. \n[552]Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay? \n[553]Give it to her now. \n[554]We have time. \n[555]Just do it, please! \n[556]Oh, God. \n[557]You don't want to see it. You don't \n[558]It's beautiful. You don't want to, though. \n[559]You did it. \n[560]You did it. Oh, my God, you did it. \n[561]I love you so much, too. Oh, my God. \n[562]You got out. You made it out. Welcome. \n[563]I love you, Debbie. \n[564]Gentlemen, it's a girl! \n[565]Yeah! \n[566]Let's meet her! She's awesome. \n[567] And then your mommy said, \"Just do it, already,\" which was very confusing to Daddy. So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already. What would you do? Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here. Isn't that nice? I think it is. \n[568]It definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there. \n[569]I look good in blue. The fighting continues. We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings. \n[570]We both look good in gold. \n[571]No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than twelve. It might take us around three hours to get home, though. ", "Stone": "", "Pete": "\n[1]  \n[2]Okay, I'm up. \n[3]Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out. \n[4]I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel now, he'll charge me. \n[5]Yeah I did. Last week, I told you. \n[6]I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to. \n[7]I did tell you. \n[8]Thank you very much. \n[9]  \n[10]Huh? \n[11]Oh, congratulations! \n[12]Hey, maybe you can get your own place now. \n[13]Yeah! We can watch \"Taxicab Confessions.\" \n[14]Good morning Alison. \n[15]Ben. \n[16]  \n[17]You stop it. \n[18]See ya later. Enjoy the day. Never do what they did. \n[19]You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home- schooled. \n[20]  \n[21]  \n[22]  \n[23]  \n[24]   \n[25]  \n[26]So what do you think? Should we have sex tonight? \n[27]Well, now. \n[28]That's pretty crazy how your sister's pregnant. \n[29]I think they'll be fine. They'll work it...Look at us. It happened to us. \n[30]Well...fuck! \n[31]   \n[32]  \n[33]That's nice. \n[34]Because he likes breakfast so much. \n[35]You don't have to be. \n[36]  \n[37]They go ape-shit over bubbles. \n[38]That's an incredible thing about a child. What's so great about bubbles? \n[39]I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles. \n[40]It's totally sad. Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything. \n[41]Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not okay. You're asking the wrong guy. Just don't ask me to lend you any money, you know? \n[42]No. \n[43]   \n[44]  \n[45]Looks like your computer has chicken pox. \n[46]We'll skip their houses when we're trick or treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse? Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my lynching rope. \n[47]I don't take it lightly. I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, \"Hey, you mind? Can you baby sit?\" \n[48]You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water. Jesus, how much \"Dateline NBC\" can you watch? \n[49]What am I doing? \n[50]I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say. \n[51]Yeah. \n[52]Pretty much. \n[53]Don't do this in front of Ben. \n[54]Sorry, Ben. \n[55]I can't go. This band is doing a showcase out in the Valley. I got to go. \n[56]I got to go. \n[57]That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant. \n[58]Probably. I'd hide you. \n[59]It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring. \n[60]Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn. \n[61]Like Mister Skin? \n[62]Dude, Mister Skin. \n[63]  \n[64]  \n[65]You're not going to tell them? \n[66]I like it. \n[67](impersonating Robert De \n[68] Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window. \n[69]No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it. \n[70]Do you want to go to India? \n[71]\"Where we're going, we don't need roads.\" \n[72]Everyone has a time machine image. \n[73]Who needs a time machine? \n[74]  \n[75]  \n[76]  \n[77]I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance. \n[78]They're incredible. \n[79]Old Steely Dan. \n[80]I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there. \n[81]And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band. \n[82]Carlos Delgado. \n[83]Oh shit! \n[84]Hideki Matsui. \n[85]Sorry, Charlie. \n[86]Debbie. \n[87]It's our fantasy baseball draft. \n[88]It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball. I told you all about this. Got Matsui. \n[89]Aw, shit. \n[90]I should have told you. \n[91]Nothing. \n[92]I'm going to be honest with you. \n[93]You've been mad because I've been working so much and I didn't want to upset you. \n[94]You would be. \n[95]It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not cheating or anything. \n[96]How is this worse? \n[97]Look, the reason I make that up is because if I told you what I was really doing, you would just get mad. So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do my fantasy draft, and it's win/win. \n[98]I went to the movies. \n[99]By myself. \n[100]\"Spiderman Three.\" \n[101]Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself. \n[102]It's not that big of a deal. \n[103]Okay, so let's see \"Spiderman Three\" next week. \n[104]Well... \n[105]What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do? \n[106]I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest. \n[107]I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit. \n[108]Come on. \n[109]Marriage is like that show \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's... Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever. \n[110]Let's do it. \n[111]Why not? \n[112]You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow? \n[113]That's awesome. \n[114]Yeah. \n[115]Pete drives with Ben to Vegas. They are wearing suits. \n[116]This is great. We're going to have the best time ever. \n[117]Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you. \n[118]Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown. \n[119]That's right. \n[120]This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around. \n[121]I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes. \n[122]Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil. \n[123]I swear to God, man. \n[124]I see the beam of light. \n[125]Woo-hoo. You're so money that you don't even know how much money you have. \n[126]This is the greatest place on earth. \n[127]Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome. \n[128]Ohhhhhh! \n[129]This is the best idea I've ever had in my life. \n[130]There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room. \n[131]These are five different types of chair. \n[132]There's a guy that works for this hotel. His whole job is to find chairs. \n[133]Look at this one. Look at it. It's gold and red and it's kind of shiny. Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is beautiful, and it feels amazing. \n[134]Oh, wow! \n[135]I'm up high! I'm really high up. \n[136]Why didn't you read the baby books? \n[137]Dude, it's real whether or not you read those books. That baby's coming. \n[138]Oh, man! \n[139]Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you? \n[140]How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?! \n[141]She's the one. She loves me. \n[142]I don't think I can accept her love. There's something wrong with me. \n[143]I don't know what it is. \n[144]I have to go to this other chair. \n[145]Oh, this is a better energy. \n[146]Tastes like a rainbow. \n[147] I want to go home, too. \n[148]   \n[149]  \n[150]  \n[151]  \n[152]Babe, we're running low on plates. Hey Ben! What's up, man? \n[153]I just got yellow cupcakes. \n[154]I can run out. I'll get some more. \n[155]I don't mind. \n[156]You sure? \n[157]You're the one that got dressed up like a cholo on Easter to come to this party. \n[158]You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother, Gabe Ruth. \n[159]You going to talk to Alison? \n[160]Right on. \n[161]Thanks, Ben. \n[162]  \n[163]  \n[164]What happened? \n[165]Really? I thought that she'd take you back. \n[166]   \n[167]  \n[168]You know, it's a rare thing that you live to see the day your wildest dreams come true. I mean what is there left to want? I get to go to Legoland. \n[169]Say it! \n[170]I shouldn't have given them all that meth then. \n[171]Or Saturday. You never know. We might see it all in one day. \n[172]   \n[173]  \n[174]  \n[175]  \n[176]All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles. \n[177]What are you doing here? \n[178]I wish I'd gotten that on tape. \n[179]I think it's Matisyahu. \n[180]Okay. "}}
