They really did hire a bunny. What?! \n[2]I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be. \n[3] \n[4]Oh, there you went, you little dickens! \n[5]Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left. \n[6] \n[7]Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay? \n[8]Chief, uh, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again. \n[9]Okay, I just didn't know if you wanted to take it this time, she seems really upset-- \n[10]I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop her, she is super slippery. I gotta go sit down. \n[11]Here ya go! One missing otter! \n[12]Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none. I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one. \n[13]The murder weapon! \n[14]Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean? \n[15]Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it? \n[16] \n[17] (finally notices ringing \n[18]Blue Rev.                   62. \n[19]Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps? \n[20]Chief Bogo! \n[21]Wait, is that Gazelle? \n[22]You have the app too?! Oh, jeeeeez! \n[23]Oh, yes of course! About that, sir... Officer Hopps just called... She found all of `em. \n[24]Um, they thought it would be better if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face you that you see when you walk into the ZPD. \n[25]They're gonna move me to Records. It's downstairs. By the boiler. ", "(voice)": "", "Yax": "\n[1]Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm. Oooooooooooohmmmmmm. \n[2]Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there, `cause we're all good on Bunny Scout Cookies. \n[3]\n[4]Huh? Oh for sure, we're a naturalist club. \n[5]Nangi's just on the other side of the pleasure pool. \n[6]Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird, but you know what I say is weird? Clothes on animals! Here we go. \n[7]As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey Nangi, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the Otter. \n[8]Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years? \n[9]He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member? \n[10]Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi? \n[11]Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi? \n[12]Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03. \n[13]Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant. ", "Bellwether": "\n[1]Oh! Yes right. \n[2]Congratulations, Officer Hopps. \n[3]Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys. \n[4]I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case! \n[5] \n[6]And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that. All right, well I'd say the case is in good hands! Us little guys really need to stick together! Right? \n[7] \n[8]Sir? If we could just review these very important-- Sir? \n[9]Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?! \n[10]No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing... sir, if I could just-- \n[11]Oh, mutton chops. \n[12] We're in Bellwether's cramped little office. Nick and Hopps hover over her while she sits at her computer.  \n[13]Where to? \n[14]There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important. \n[15]Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote... But he did give me that nice mug. \n[16]Feels good to be appreciated. \n[17]That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me. Yes, sir? \n[18]Oh, dear. I better go -- Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be-- \n[19]Officer Hopps, it's time. \n[20]Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions... \n[21]Oh, you did fine. \n[22] Hopps looks at the pamphlet. Bellwether sits across from her at her desk.  \n[23]Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD. \n[24]Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit... \n[25]Judy! Judy! \n[26] \n[27]I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now. \n[28]Get them! \n[29]Come on out, Judy! \n[30]We're on the same team, Judy! \n[31]Underestimated. Under-appreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud, but prey out-number predators 10 to one. \n[32]Think of it-- 90 percent of the population, united against a common enemy. We'll be unstoppable. \n[33] \n[34]Well, you should have stayed on the carrot farm, huh? It really is too bad; I really did like you. \n[35]No! Of course not... he is. \n[36]Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the natural history museum. Officer Hopps is down! Please hurry! \n[37]Oh, but he can't help it, can he? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages. \n[38]Gosh, think of the headline: \"Hero Cop Killed By Savage Fox...\" \n[39]Yeah, pretty much. \n[40]Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way. \n[41]Bye-Bye, Bunny. \n[42]What? \n[43]I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too! It's my word against yours! \n[44]And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way... ", "Flash": "\n[1]Nice to... see you... too. \n[2]I am... doing... just... \n[3]...as well... as... I can... be. What... \n[4]...can I... do... \n[5]For you... \n[6]...today. \n[7]Sure.    What's the... plate... \n[8]...Number? \n[9] \n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]0. \n[14]Sure. \n[15]I don't... know... What... do... you call... a... \n[16]Three humped... camel? \n[17]Ha... ha... ha... ha... \n[18]Hey... Priscilla... \n[19]What... do... \n[20]You call... a... \n[21]Three... humped... \n[22]Here... \n[23]You... go. \n[24] Manchas is driving when he's attacked from the back seat.  \n[25] ", "Gazelle": "\n[1]I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia! \n[2]Wow, you are one hot dancer... \n[3]Wow, you are one hot dancer... \n[4]I am Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer. \n[5]Wow! I'm impressed. \n[6]Zootopia is a unique place. It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city where we celebrate our differences. This is not the Zootopia I know. \n[7]The Zootopia I know is better than this. \n[8]We don't just blindly assign blame. We don't know why these attacks keep happening... \n[9]...but it is irresponsible to label all predators as savages. \n[10]We cannot let fear divide us. Please-- give me back the Zootopia I love...
