I want you to meet \t\t\tsomebody. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI expect you'll like her.  \tBrenda coolly files her nails.  A flash of jealousy.  \n[6]\t\t\tThat's better.

We're so hush-hush, even \t\t\twe know nothing about it. \t\t\t\t(before Emma can \t\t\t\tmake sense of this) \t\t\tNow let's see, there's coconut cake, \t\t\tdate and walnut; I recommend the \t\t\trum baba ...  \n[10]\t\t\tLooks like rain, Steed...  \n[11]\t\t\tOh, yes we are.  \n[12]\t\t\tWe've had a series of bizarre weather reports. \t\t\tWe kept them hush-hush and sent agents into \t\t\tthe field for data. Case number one: \t\t\tApril 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins \t\t\tinvestigating mysterious fires in corn circles. \t\t\tA field outside the village of Little Snoring, \t\t\tone of the hottest days of the year. Trapped \t\t\tby a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death \t\t\tin a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in \t\t\tperma-frost. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tCase two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M. \t\t\tTook off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges, \t\t\tinvestigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak \t\t\trainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a \t\t\tflying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five \t\t\tinches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size \t\t\tof a cricket pitch ... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief \t\t\tMajor Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip \t\t\tfield near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins \t\t\trecorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth, \t\t\ttemperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous \t\t\tcombustion. Not much of him left ...  \tCLICK.  The lights go back on.  Emma notices - a new arrival \t \ta tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.  \n[13]\t\t\tMy number two. Special assignments. \t\t\tShe's --  \n[14]\t\t\tAll happy families here, Mrs. Peel.  \tFather's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.  Runs her fingers over Emma's face. \tGets the outline.  Emma realizes --  \n[15]\t\t\tGod, you're quick.  \n[16]\t\t\tHave a look at these, Mrs. Peel --  \tHe passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:  Steed investigates a \tpair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.  The shoes have agent Simkins' name \tin them ...  \n[17]\t\t\tA series of bizarre shifts in local weather \t\t\tpatterns ...  \n[18]\t\t\tJungle plants in the Arctic? A lush \t\t\tEnglish village transformed overnight \t\t\tinto African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?  \n[19]\t\t\tSomething strange is happening. And \t\t\twhoever knows about it doesn't want \t\t\tus to find out.  \n[20]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYour mission is simple. Find out \t\t\thow and why these agents died.  \n[21]\t\t\tYour research into climate engineering was \t\t\tstate-of-the-art. Your experiments could \t\t\thave revolutionized our knowledge of global \t\t\twarming -- had they succeeded. We need \t\t\tyour expertise.  \n[22]\t\t\tOne moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another \t\t\tspecial reason we wanted you to join our \t\t\thappy family; rather curious, actually ...  \tMother hits the lights.  He flicks the video into slow-mo.  File thru image clarification, \tidentikit sketches.  \n[23]\t\t\tEye witness reports. Strangers in the area. \t\t\tOne description tallied in all three places. \t\t\tRecognize her?  \tEmma locks.  On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.  Steed reacts.  \n[24]\t\t\tThink of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. \t\t\tWith a twist. You're our chief suspect.  \n[25]\t\t\tFather will be your controller. Steed here \t\t\twill show you the ropes.  \n[26]\t\t\tShe may not know. Theory goes she \t\t\tmay be very ill.  \n[27]\t\t\tPossibly. Split personality ...  \n[28]\t\t\tWho knows? If Dr. Darling is right, \t\t\tyou should watch out.  \n[29]\t\t\tShe may try to kill you.   \n[30]\t\t\tSomething went wrong. System malfunction. \t\t\tExplosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. \t\t\tSuspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File \t\t\tstill open.  \n[31]\t\t\tStill doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She \t\t\twas in a dangerous game, Steed. High \t\t\tstakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If \t\t\tshe is, there's only one solution.  Termination.  \n[32]\t\t\tYou.  \tOFF Steed's reaction.  CLASHING BLADES OVER ...   \n[33] \tDark.  Switches on the light.  And gasps.   \n[34] \tMeanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.  Towards the other room, sees dead \tTeddy.  Reads the label on his suitcase ...  \n[35]  \n[36]\t\t\tEmergency alert ...   \n[37]\t\t\tA cyclone hit Banffshire last night. \t\t\tCompletely unpredicted ...   \n[38]\t\t\tMobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't \t\t\ttake chances. I'm looking after \t\t\tthings while he's hiding out ...  \tFather drives like a maniac.  She senses their unease.  \n[39]\t\t\tYou're probably wondering how I \t\t\tcan drive 'blind.' Simple. A new \t\t\tprototype from the boys in X division. \t\t\tMicro-sensors in the system read \t\t\tsignals and road information. Converts \t\t\tthe info into miles per hour. \t\t\tUltra-sensitive.  Ultra-smart.  \tFather jumps a red light.  CARS SCREECH together in a huge pile-up.  Not that smart. \tSteed holds onto his hat.  \n[40]\t\t\tSo you say ...  \n[41]\t\t\tIt's Mother you have to convince. \t\t\tHe's very agitated.  Wait here.  \tFather SCREECHES to a halt on Holland Park Avenue  \tSteed and Emma get out.  Father takes off ...  \n[42]\t\t\tWelcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's \t\t\tturning quite nasty. Sir August was \t\t\tblown to smithereens. Along with \t\t\thalf of Banffshire.  The Ministry's \t\t\tworried.  \n[43]\t\t\tToo late anyway. Today's escapade \t\t\twas only for starters. This is no \t\t\tordinary weather. It's manmade. A \t\t\tkind of weather bomb.  \n[44]\t\t\tWould it be possible to use it for \t\t\tmilitary purposes?  \n[45]\t\t\tLondon. The World Council of Ministers \t\t\tmeets soon on global defence. If you can \t\t\tcontrol the weather, you control the world.  \n[46] \tSteed looks around, picks the lock ... hi-tech style ...   \n[47] \tA kind of space-age travel agency.  Steed enters.  \tAt the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.  Steed sneaks in, moves \tbehind a screen, overhears --  \tA man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist  \n[48] \tEmma sees a statue of a Butler.  Which springs to life.  Summons Emma.  She follows \tdown a path strewn with leaves.  \tAs Emma steps on the leaves, she --  \tFalls down -- a giant rabbit hole.   \n[49]\t\t\tThis man -- did you see him?  \n[50]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou are here under observation, \t\t\tMrs. Peel. You must answer Dr. \t\t\tDarling's questions  \tPushes Dr. Darling aside.  \n[51]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You \t\t\tcan't resign.  \n[52]\t\t\tDon't open that, Mrs. Peel!  \tFat chance ... she goes in ...   \n[53]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe want to help...!  \n[54]\t\t\tThe death of Peter Peel was a \t\t\tgreat loss. To us all ...  \n[55]\t\t\tPeter Peel was a first class agent. \t\t\tA senior operative. \t\t\t'X' department Special operations. \t\t\tHe was engaged in top secret research. \t\t\tTop priority.

A life lived on a lie.  \n[57]\t\t\t... was written by me. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.  \tDeadly serious, Emma walks over to him.  \n[58]\t\t\tQuite frankly ... it could have \t\t\tbeen you.  \tSilence.  Emma looks away, shocked.  Steed intervenes  \n[59]\t\t\tHer husband suspected someone very \t\t\tclose to the operation. On the day he \t\t\tdied, he was setting a test. \t\t\tTo prove to himself -- to us that his \t\t\twife was beyond suspicion. He had to \t\t\tbe certain. He said he was going to \t\t\tgive Mrs. Peel something ...  \tEmma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.  \n[60]\t\t\t... I want you to remember. Did \t\t\tPeter give you anything on-that \t\t\tday?   \n[61]\t\t\tUnder suspicion. Everyone died in \t\t\tthe explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were \t\t\tthe only survivor ...  \tMother waits.  Emma turns round.  Looks fiercely at him.  Mother shifts uneasily as \tEmma walks past him to the airlock.  \n[62]\t\t\tThis is an official matter, Mrs. \t\t\tPeel. No need to take it \t\t\tpersonally. Where are you going?  \n[63]\t\t\tThe doors and walls are monitored, \t\t\tMrs. Peel. This is a very secure \t\t\testablishment.  \n[64]\t\t\tPity. I was growing fond of Mrs. \t\t\tPeel. Unfortunately --  \n[65]\t\t\tMother and Father know best.  \tMother wheels himself off.  Then stops; over his shoulder:  \n[66]\t\t\tSomething quick. Nothing too ... \t\t\tmessy.  \tON Steed.  CAR ROAR over as --   \n[67] \tSteed on the phone.  \n[68] \tAt the controls, Brenda looks on.  She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.  Who \tpicks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in \tpassenger seats --  \tORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --  \n[69]\t\t\tInside that hall are some of the \t\t\tMost powerful figures in the \t\t\tworld. Tight security. Our \t\t\tonly option.  \n[70]\t\t\tI'll see to it personally.  \tBrenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --   \n[71]\t\t\tWe want Mrs. Peel.  \n[72]\t\t\tYou disobeyed an order, Steed. \t\t\tMrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot \t\t\tbe trusted.  \tEmma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --  \n[73]\t\t\tI shall summon security.  \tShe turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.  \tEmma returns as the ALARM is raised --  \n[74] \tMother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...   \n[75] \tThru the blizzard, zooming down streets, landmark buildings looming up topped in \tsnow, feet up ... shinnying up the chain wire ...  \t\"THE MERRY WIDOW WALTZ,\" no longer heard as old record or ensemble \tarrangement but enormous, for FULL ORCHESTRA ...   \n[76] \twhich unloads a rope ladder as Emma puts on every ounce of steam ... \tThe Man reaches for the dangling ladder -- \tbut --   \n[77]\t\t\tWhere's Mrs. Peel?  \tHe signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits there.  \n[78]\t\t\tYou're getting yourself into terrible \t\t\ttrouble, my son. Weather's turning \t\t\tvery nasty -- and so am I.  \n[79]\t\t\t\t(grabs mirror; \t\t\t\tsearches his face \t\t\tWhere?  \n[80]\t\t\tI'm warning you for the last time, \t\t\tSteed: whoever's behind all this, \t\t\tlooks like Mrs. Peel, walks like \t\t\tMrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.  \tCLICK.  The line goes dead.   \n[81] \tFurious.  \n[82]\t\t\tSteed?? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tFind Mrs. Peel.  \tBrenda smiles at the thought.  Father rises, grim.   \n[83]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tEmma in Wonderland. Welcome, \t\t\tMrs. Peel. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe've been expecting you. We hope \t\t\tyou'll enjoy your stay with us. \t\t\tDecontamination is almost complete.  \n[84]\t\t\tAnd you've a new wardrobe. He \t\t\tdoes want you to look attractive. \t\t\t\t \t\t\tHe tells me you're very beautiful.  \tEmma pounds the glass in frustration.  \n[85]\t\t\tRelax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds \t\t\tof feet below ground. The Ministry \t\t\tmade it impregnable. No one can \t\t\tsave you.   \n[86]\t\t\tSteed  \n[87]\t\t\tYou reek of Mrs. Peel's Black \t\t\tLeather ...  \n[88]\t\t\tMother betrayed me. She was \t\t\tgoing to replace me with a younger \t\t\tFather.  Errand boy that's all I was. \t\t\t'Find Steed...'  \n[89]\t\t\tDr. Darling, this is Father. We \t\t\thave an intruder. I repeat --  \tValentine switches off the PA.  \n[90] \tThe grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --  \n[91] \trun towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a \tsartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !  One drops -- Bam -- !  The other collapses, slump \tto the ground.  Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --  \tA dent in its steel top.  For the first time, Steed loses his cool.  Genuine rage.  \n[92]\t\t\tCongratulations. The clouds are \t\t\ton course ...  \n[93]\t\t\tNot yet! They haven't heard our \t\t\tterms ... !  \tFather tries to hit the switch.  Valentine yanks her off.  \n[94]\t\t\tBut all those people -- !  \tValentine strikes her hard --  \n[95] \tMother at the controls.  RINGS the ALARM.  Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE. \tWARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --  \n[96]\t\t\tDense cloud formation moving south- \t\t\twest. On course for the center of the \t\t\tcity. A fog floating in from the river. \t\t\tThe prediction is ... unstable chemical \t\t\treaction. Enforce the curfew ... \t\t\tEmergency stand by ... !   \n[97]\t\t\tAbout your next assignment, Mrs. \t\t\tPeel ...  \n[98]\t\t\tAhem.
