You think you're just you, and you want to chase the foxes, but other people planted that in you years ago. 10/29/07 10. \n[36]Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are considered very cute by us humans, and we keep breeding you not to chase foxes, but to be cute, and we put you in movies and television shows, and you, you're chasing tennis balls cause there as close to a fox as you're going to get. \n[37]    \n[38]Want me to read this?

You smoke in non-smoking rooms. \n[159]Okay, open your eyes... \n[160]Yeah, you see, you don't know me at all. \n[161]Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it? \n[162]No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated. \n[163]You know... I don't know. \n[164]She was great. \n[165]My situation? \n[166]That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads? 10/29/07 41. \n[167]What? \n[168]Jesus, Pop. \n[169]I thought he was your boyfriend? \n[170]Pop. \n[171]Alright, come on.

Very serious. \n[177]That's kind of a classic American thing. \n[178]Yeah, Like page 75? \n[179]Or 75 all the way through, through 80. \n[180]      \n[181]Veronica Lake. \n[182]She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis at the age of 53. \n[183]Yeah. \n[184]It's really good. 10/29/07 46. \n[185]What do you think? \n[186]It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it. \n[187]You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. \n[188]How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends? \n[189]You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. \n[190]Yeah, I guess so. \n[191]  \n[192]Pop? \n[193]What are you--? Pop. What? \n[194]Prednisone makes you crazy. \n[195]Pop, you should rest. 10/29/07 48. \n[196]Nothing, you're pretty. \n[197]Yeah. \n[198]You're kidding right? \n[199]She did not. \n[200]This is what it looks like when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003. And when I tell her that my mother was Jewish. And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge. And they got married in 1955. \n[201]My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13. It was 1938. This is what people looked like. \n[202]And lions and giraffes. This man was Man of the Year. \n[203]Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish. This is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was Jewish. \n[204]This is what pretty looked like in 1938. \n[205]My father realized he was gay when he was 13. It was 1938. \n[206]This is what pretty looked like. 10/29/07 50. \n[207]This is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the Fifties. \n[208]My father said if you got caught my the Vice Squad you could lose everything... This is everything. \n[209]My father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955. The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness, but it could be cured. \n[210]Not everyone got cured. \n[211]This is where my parents lived in 1955. \n[212]And this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting. \n[213]While they were reciting their vows, here in this church... \n[214]Allen Ginsburg was writing his famous poem, Howl, blocks away in this room. \n[215]  \n[216]Yeah. Right. \n[217]Here, Pop. \n[218]I know, I know. Come on. \n[219]Alright. \n[220]But what about this chair? Is it gay? \n[221]Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far. \n[222]Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy. 10/29/07 54. \n[223]You need to tell Andy that you're... not well. \n[224]Me? \n[225]Hey. \n[226]Yeah? \n[227]Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys. \n[228]No. 10/29/07 55. \n[229]I don't know Andy. \n[230]Okay, okay. \n[231]I couldn't tell him. \n[232]No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you. \n[233]Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay? \n[234]He's that bad? \n[235] \n[236]Oui? \n[237]Oui Papa. \n[238]Doing what? \n[239]You should tell mom about that, not me. \n[240]Just as it was going so well. \n[241]Hey Anna? \n[242]How do you feel about vandalism? 10/29/07 58. \n[243]You okay? \n[244]Okay. \n[245]Yeah. \n[246]I'm trying to impress you. \n[247]Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. \n[248]Uh, do you mind? \n[249]Yeah. \n[250]Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick. \n[251]He did a lot of shopping. Bought all these books. \n[252]And new clothes. \n[253] \n[254]He was obsessed with Staples. \n[255] \n[256]He bought a lot of plants. \n[257]He had a lot of parties. \n[258]I thought I was making dinner? \n[259]He had these political letter writing parties, there was an out gay congressman he was supporting... 10/29/07 63. \n[260]He started telling everyone that he was getting better. \n[261]Why're you telling them you're \"turning the corner\"? \n[262]You have stage 4 cancer? \n[263]Pop. There is no stage 5. \n[264]What does it mean? \n[265]What movie are we watching? \n[266]Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is. \n[267]He hired a secretary that he could dictate to. \n[268]He wrote an essay about religion... \n[269]You re-wrote Jesus' death? \n[270]For the first time I saw him really in love. \n[271]Anna? \n[272]If this is too much, then we should just stop. \n[273] \n[274]No! 10/29/07 67. \n[275] \n[276] \n[277] \n[278]He talks to you too? \n[279]Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes. \n[280]You okay?  You did really well. \n[281]You watching all the humans going around and around. \n[282]If I leave him on his own, he loses all control. \n[283]Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car. \n[284]She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog. \n[285]You're gonna call the authorities? \n[286]Sorry, excuse us, sorry. \n[287]He shouldn't do this to you. \n[288]Your leaving soon? \n[289]I think you should come to my house and move in with me. \n[290]Yeah, a lot. \n[291]Yes . \n[292]But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now. \n[293]Cause I'm falling in love with you. \n[294]Anna and I are in a relationship in 2003. \n[295] \n[296]This is what the sun looks like and the stars. This is what it looks like when we eat. When we tell each other the stories in our heads. \n[297]I was born in 1965. Anna was born in 1971. This is what the sun looked like. Her pets. Her parents. She left home when she was 16. She lived here and here and here. \n[298] \n[299]She had three serious relationships. She left all of them. I had four serious relationships. I left them too. Or let them fall apart. 10/29/07 72. \n[300] \n[301] \n[302]We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears. Her feet. This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, in 2003. \n[303] \n[304] \n[305]This is what it looks like when she cries. When she tells me there's always a new empty room waiting for her. They used to make her feel free. Now they make her feel the opposite of free. \n[306]  \n[307]Next one. \n[308]Yeah, everyone knows that, here. \n[309]Everyone knows about that Pop. \n[310]No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love. \n[311]But you were gay that whole time. \n[312]For 44 years? \n[313]What about sex? You guys had sex? \n[314]And mom? You wanted mom too right? \n[315]Sex. \n[316]Life. \n[317]Healing. \n[318]Sunlight. 10/29/07 75. \n[319] \n[320]Spirit. \n[321]The first Gay Pride flag was made in 1978 by a man named Gilbert Baker. He gave a meaning to each color. \n[322]This man was President. This was invented, this is what movies looked like. Pets. \n[323]On November 27th, 1978. Harvey Milk was shot and killed. \n[324]One week later, my father opened his annual Museum Christmas Exhibit. He collected stuffed animals from people in the community, and put them on display. My father printed a quote from The Velveteen Rabbit in large type on the wall... \n[325]...`The stuffed rabbit asked - What is real? And the Horse said, \"Real isn't how you're made. It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long long time not just to play with, but really loves then you become real... 10/29/07 76. \n[326]...'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily... \n[327]...Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. But these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'\" \n[328]Yeah? Is that a good idea? \n[329]  \n[330]This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. \n[331]Here, this could be your... \n[332]Your gonna need a big CD box. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet. \n[333]I'm sorry. \n[334]Well, that went well. \n[335]    \n[336]Come on Arthur. \n[337]  \n[338]This is the living room. \n[339]Dining room. \n[340]There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. \n[341]  \n[342]These're the stairs. \n[343]They go up. \n[344]  \n[345]I emptied these for you. I'll get your case. 10/29/07 79. \n[346]Are you okay? \n[347]   \n[348]   \n[349]  \n[350]Are you? \n[351]Why were you crying yesterday? \n[352]     \n[353]   \n[354]   \n[355]  \n[356]Yeah. \n[357]  \n[358]Well are you happy here? \n[359]  \n[360]I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. \n[361]   \n[362]  \n[363]I can barely remember you from when I was little. \n[364]Let's go home. \n[365]Let's go. \n[366]  \n[367]  \n[368]  \n[369]Anna? Where where you? \n[370]Hey. \n[371]   \n[372]Okay? Thanks. \n[373]   \n[374]Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. \n[375]You, you're in LA? \n[376]You said you were coming here?! \n[377]Fuck. I'm in your building. \n[378]Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here. \n[379]  \n[380] \n[381]Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work. \n[382]Great. You look great. \n[383]Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag. \n[384]You will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card, phone account, utility, gym membership, every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes. \n[385]You will have all their mail forwarded to your address. You will write their obituary. You run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word. You will wonder if it's right. You'll throw a lot of their stuff away. You'll bring a lot of their stuff to your house. This is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom. \n[386]When I was a kid I thought that was my arm giving her daisies. Now I make a new mistake and think it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying, here, here's simple and happy. That's what I meant to give you. \n[387]Hey. \n[388]Arthur... \n[389]Thank you... Thanks. 10/29/07 92. \n[390]What? \n[391]No. No, it's because my father loved you so much. \n[392]  \n[393]Arthur... hey.

", "Andy": "\n[1]Okay. Is it on? \n[2]This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you. 10/29/07 2. \n[3]Since I came out to my father, he never speaks to me.
