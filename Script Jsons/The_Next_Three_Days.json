I can't leave, I'm in -- \n[2]Do you have the ruling in Brennan? \n[3]The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore. \n[4]And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks. \n[5]John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings. \n[6]No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me. \n[7]I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife. \n[8]I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it.

We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us? \n[7]Busy? \n[8]Come on, we owe you for the cookies. \n[9]And learned how to pre-package them. \n[10]Do you trade off time with Luke? \n[11]Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much. \n[12]I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it? \n[13]Oh. \n[14]I understand. \n[15]...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't. \n[16] \n[17]That would be great. \n[18]  \n[19]Hello? \n[20]Thanks.   Good to see you. \n[21]Those aren't easy to wrap.

If you were smart you would stop talking right now. \n[2]How can you say that?? \n[3]Erit, you are so full of shit. \n[4]Because she's a bitch! -- --Not because she's a woman. \n[5]That has nothing to do with it! \n[6]You'd rather \"work under\" John? \n[7]No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo? \n[8]So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me. \n[9]How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits. \n[10]DON'T try and agree with me now. \n[11]Shut up. \n[12]We went to her office party, idiot. \n[13]You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her. \n[14]You are such an asshole. \n[15]Hello! \n[16]Did he cry? \n[17]  \n[18]Squeeze in tight. \n[19]Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen. \n[20]Present. \n[21]You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds. \n[22] \n[23]After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow? \n[24] \n[25] \n[26]You're completely impossible. \n[27]Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here? \n[28]How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you? \n[29]I give up. \n[30]\n[31]She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead?? \n[32]Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss? Come on, give Mommy a kiss. \n[33]Is Daddy reading you my letters? \n[34]What are you building?    A fort? \n[35]Was he scared going to school? \n[36]What did you make him for lunch? \n[37]Look at his friends.   And his desk. This is his teacher? \n[38]You may have to move to another school district. \n[39] \n[40]When is she coming? \n[41]It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. Have you heard anything? \n[42]--Don't-- \n[43]I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared. \n[44]Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it. \n[45]Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet. \n[46]   \n[47]I need you to run for governor. \n[48]You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years. \n[49]I'm okay.   I'm okay. \n[50]You think he'll ever want to kiss me again? \n[51]  \n[52]I'm fine.    I'm fine. \n[53]Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing? \n[54] \n[55]I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind. \n[56]Oh, that's nice. \n[57]Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten. \n[58]Fine, I won't forget again, okay? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay? \n[59] \n[60]I need you to do something for me. \n[61]Stop bringing him. \n[62]He hates coming here.   Look at him. \n[63]Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me. \n[64]You want to hear something funny? \n[65]My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream. \n[66] \n[67]I think it's very sexy. \n[68]You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this. \n[69]I don't want you not telling me things. \n[70]  \n[71]  \n[72]I was only here through the appeal. We knew I'd be moved to a prison. \n[73]What's wrong? \n[74]Is it Luke? \n[75]You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do. \n[76]I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- ! \n[77]Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better? \n[78]And now you're apologizing.   You really are a gem. \n[79]Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her. \n[80]Then you'd be wrong. \n[81]I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet. \n[82]I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry. \n[83]  \n[84]John?? \n[85] \n[86]You have to stop this. \n[87]No.   Stop. \n[88]\n[89]No. \n[90]No! \n[91]...Where is he? \n[92]How can you do this to me? \n[93]John -- \n[94]You son of a bitch. \n[95]Where's Luke?! Is he safe?   Where is he?! \n[96] \n[97]Why didn't you tell me? \n[98]What's wrong? \n[99]Where's Luke? \n[100]What party?     You said the party was here. \n[101] \n[102]You took the wrong turn!    It's back there. \n[103]The zoo is back there. You're going the wrong way! It's back there! \n[104]What?? \n[105]Are you out of your mind! \n[106]Hi. \n[107]Did you have a nice time at the party? \n[108]What was your favorite thing? \n[109]They had ice cream cake here? \n[110]Oh.   What flavor? \n[111]My favorite. \n[112]I'm going to sit back here, okay? \n[113]Really? \n[114]Good.   Then I'll stick close to you. \n[115]John? What are we going to do? \n[116]I'll do this. \n[117]Hello. \n[118]Thank you. \n[119]  \n[120]        \n[121]  ", "John": "\n[1]Either of you like another drink? \n[2] \n[3]That was a great meal!           Okay--okay! \n[4]She is completely full of shit. \n[5]You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession. \n[6]I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud. \n[7]I think she hit on me that night, too. \n[8]I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery. \n[9]You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your-- \n[10]Someone's going to -- \n[11]Thanks.   See you next weekend. \n[12]  \n[13]Okay, your turn. \n[14]Very good, very good... \n[15]No, no, no; you feed me. Your son is hopeless. \n[16]You can't do this every morning.   It is way too corny. \n[17] \n[18]  \n[19]Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke? \n[20]Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange. \n[21]When? \n[22]I sent him flowers and a handmade card. \n[23]Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt. \n[24]Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went <grunts>. Made me tear up. \n[25] \n[26]Now she's driving a wedge between us. \n[27]And now she is abandoning you. \n[28]Get your -- \n[29] \n[30] \n[31]It's okay.     Just a bad dream. \n[32]  \n[33]You okay? \n[34]Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed. \n[35]You're such a snake, I don't know why I keep falling for the same trick. \n[36]But Sam's your friend, right? \n[37]Does he take your food? \n[38]Did he say something mean? About Mommy? \n[39]Did you hit him? \n[40]Good.    Where did you hit him? \n[41]Wow.    I bet that hurt. \n[42]It's a toy! \n[43]Don't worry.     We'll get it back. \n[44]Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss. \n[45]Every night at bedtime. \n[46]I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave. \n[47]Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no \"vegetables\" on it. He swore he ate his apple. \n[48]Miss Phillips. \n[49]Already spoke to a realtor. \n[50]Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom. \n[51]She's having a lot of trouble with her business. \n[52]About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say? \n[53]-- It can take months for the court to rule. \n[54]Meyer's looking for a new investigator. \n[55]He'll go through all the evidence again. \n[56]We're doing fine. \n[57]I don't know, I'm a little busy. \n[58]-- Oh, that I can do. \n[59]I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise. \n[60]  \n[61]Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. \n[62]Good? \n[63]She's doing okay. \n[64]I will. \n[65]Ok.   Thanks. \n[66]Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on. \n[67] \n[68]But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot? \n[69]It was a robbery!   Someone stole her purse! \n[70]So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court. \n[71]So, I need to find an indecent one? \n[72]Anything. \n[73] \n[74] \n[75]Everyone fights with their boss! \n[76]So, you never believed she was innocent? \n[77]So, what are you saying, Meyer?! \n[78] \n[79]  \n[80]Thanks. \n[81]  \n[82]    \n[83]  \n[84]Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R- \n[85]That's ridiculous; I have to see her. \n[86]Lara! \n[87]Lara! \n[88]My wife attempted suicide. \n[89]I have to see her! \n[90]Please.   Two minutes. \n[91] \n[92]I insist.    I kept you out on a school night. \n[93]  \n[94]And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back? \n[95]Soon honey.    Soon. \n[96]Can you have a quarter? \n[97]Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend those. They come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a baby. \n[98]...Sure. \n[99]  \n[100]So, what is it about?   Julie? \n[101]No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about? \n[102]It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it. \n[103]It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost. \n[104]You escaped from jail seven times. \n[105]Mind if I tape you? \n[106]How you escaped when no one else could. \n[107]How do you do that? \n[108]  \n[109]How the hell do you know that? \n[110]The city. \n[111]...Pittsburgh. \n[112]   \n[113]How can they be so exact? \n[114]  \n[115]  \n[116]What if you can't make it out? \n[117]Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time. \n[118]  \n[119]  \n[120]  \n[121]      \n[122]  \n[123]How much? \n[124]  \n[125]  \n[126]How did you get caught? \n[127]Yeah. \n[128]  \n[129]  \n[130]  \n[131]  \n[132]  \n[133]Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor. \n[134]I'll talk to her. \n[135]I'll talk to her. Let's go, Squirrel. \n[136]Hey. Are you alright? \n[137]The doctor told me about the insulin. \n[138]You forgot?    For how many days? \n[139]--And so much to do. \n[140]Why are you doing this? \n[141]No.   I need you to -- \n[142]Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise. \n[143]Sure. \n[144]Come on... \n[145]Lara.... \n[146]Yes.    Anything. \n[147]     \n[148]I'm very sure. Thanks. \n[149]  \n[150] \n[151]    \n[152]Thanks. \n[153]Adderall? \n[154]I need some passports. \n[155]I can do that. \n[156]No. \n[157]What's your name? \n[158]Mouss said to come see you. \n[159]Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number. \n[160]He babysits my kid. \n[161]Yes.   How much? \n[162]  \n[163]  \n[164]Give me two minutes. \n[165]  \n[166]It was stupid, I fell off the bike. \n[167]Some guy made a crack about Lara. \n[168]What's that supposed to mean? \n[169]Really?   So, what do you believe, Mom? \n[170]  \n[171]No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake. \n[172] \n[173]A little. \n[174]No. \n[175]What? \n[176]Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check. \n[177]That's too much. \n[178]Not here.   Don't come here again. \n[179]Show me how to load it. \n[180]No video game. \n[181]I'll play checkers with you after dinner. \n[182] \n[183]  \n[184]I'll just be a moment. \n[185]I am useless without you.    I can't even ride a bike. \n[186]I'm sorry we had to do this. \n[187]I know. \n[188]From now on I will. \n[189]  \n[190]Hi. \n[191]I hope it's nothing serious. \n[192]Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class. \n[193]I need them. \n[194]Which guy? \n[195]How are you doing today? \n[196]Sorry. \n[197]...In the middle there. \n[198] \n[199]  \n[200]Yes. \n[201]Sorry. \n[202]  \n[203]You hungry?    You want your sandwich? \n[204]I remember. \n[205] \n[206]He has his father's memory. \n[207]I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated. \n[208]Oh, we're pretty...you know.... \n[209]That's true.     And I made those cookies. \n[210]Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke. \n[211]No. Luke and I are together full time. \n[212]She'd like nothing better than to be here. With him. Lara. She really misses...all this. \n[213]No.  She's not like that.   She'd... She's in prison. \n[214]I don't tell most people. \n[215]She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman. \n[216]We should really be getting home. \n[217] \n[218]  \n[219]You want to read a letter from Mom? \n[220]Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate... \n[221]My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out. \n[222]She's not feeling well. \n[223]Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed. \n[224]The doctors do tests. \n[225]Come on. \n[226]  \n[227] \n[228]  \n[229]  \n[230]You okay? \n[231]  \n[232]  \n[233]Luke!   Time for bed. \n[234]...What's wrong? \n[235]What is it? \n[236]No....NO! They can't move you. Not without notice! Monday isn't notice! \n[237]Muncy is the other side of the state. \n[238]I don't have two weeks!     I need it tomorrow! \n[239]How much can they give me?! \n[240]     \n[241]Are you --? \n[242]I am so sorry -- \n[243]No, it was a long shot.       Thanks. \n[244]She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer. \n[245]Nothing. \n[246]No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved. \n[247]I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him. \n[248] \n[249]Yes.   Sorry. \n[250]Got it.   I'm sorry. \n[251]What do you want from me? \n[252] \n[253]Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are. \n[254]Thank you. \n[255]You think? \n[256]Hi Mom. \n[257]I've got class. \n[258]Yes.

That's what I'm going to do. \n[277]Your money. \n[278]No.    It was. \n[279]-- What?? \n[280]Get up there!! \n[281]Is anyone up here?! \n[282]Hi.

Do it!! \n[310]Tape their mouths! \n[311]Put it on. \n[312]Because we have no other choice!! Put it on! Turn around. \n[313]Lara, put the clothes on! \n[314]\n[315]Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming. \n[316]Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming. \n[317]Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either. \n[318]Does it look like I'm going home?!

Nicole. \n[337]She'll call my parents. \n[338]They'll take care of him, I will figure out how to get him to us. \n[339]I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!! \n[340]I promise. I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way. \n[341]No, it really is fine. I can't thank you enough for taking care of him. \n[342]Sure. \n[343] \n[344]Stay in the car. \n[345] \n[346] ", "Luke": "\n[1]  \n[2]Daddy!...

", "Erit": "\n[1]Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women. \n[2]They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not. \n[3]So, your boss isn't threatened by you? \n[4]And you would describe her as \"attractive\"? \n[5]And there is my answer. \n[6]Women should work under men, men under women. That's it. \n[7]That's fine, too. They're used to it! Why are you laughing? \n[8] \n[9]You have a problem with that, too? \n[10]What is up your ass tonight?? \n[11] \n[12]-- You know what your problem is?! \n[13]I know you won't want to hear this... \n[14]Excuse me?
