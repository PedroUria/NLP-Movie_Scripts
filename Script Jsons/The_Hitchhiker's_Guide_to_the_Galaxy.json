We'll see who rusts first. \n[6]The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me. \n[7]On display? I had to go down to a cellar! \n[8]I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'. \n[9]How much? \n[10]Ford? \n[11]Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford They're going to demolish my home, \n[12]But what about my house? \n[13]Can we trust him? \n[14]And how far's that? \n[15]Well, when does he get back from lunch?

I never could get the hang of Thursdays. \n[25]No, it's not that.    It's.... \n[26]I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about? \n[27]At that flat in Islington. I told you about it.

Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice. \n[31]Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. \n[32]Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious. \n[33]She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees.

What's happening...? \n[72]Ford... \n[73]And if we're unlucky? \n[74]Actually...I rather liked it. \n[75]Um...some of the words I didn't understand, but I found the imagery quite effective. \n[76]And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity... \n[77]...

What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies. \n[177]Ford..? \n[178]Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?! \n[179]I don't care what you think you think... \n[180]No.    No!     NOOO!!! \n[181]Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it? \n[182]Here I am, God knows how far from home... \n[183]...and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth. \n[184]Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it was... \n[185]Yes.   Great wide rolling blue oceans. \n[186]So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot. \n[187]Aah! \n[188]Who are you? \n[189]Late? What for? \n[190]Dent. Arthur Dent. \n[191]Trust a man who won't tell me his name? \n[192]Whaa! \n[193]I have found this whole day a bit disturbing. \n[194]...and men. \n[195]The best laid plans of mice and men. \n[196]Oh, you had that problem, too? \n[197]What? You did that? I've been there! \n[198]The Vogons? \n[199]So -- it wasn't destroyed? \n[200]So you're saying you ... made the Earth? \n[201]Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice? \n[202]They brought...I'm sorry, when you say \"mice\" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation? \n[203]Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see -- we were experimenting on them. \n[204]So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed? \n[205]Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ... \n[206]And are you? \n[207]Is this...? \n[208]What -- what are you doing? What happened to you? \n[209]Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea? \n[210]Now that's a cup of tea. \n[211]Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it. \n[212]In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let go of this table. HHGG 3rd Revised Draft 8/8/03 \n[213]I'm sorry, when you say \"the only living native\" -- do you mean me? What about her? \n[214]So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it. \n[215]Mmmm.    This really is delicious. \n[216]An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show. \n[217]I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain? \n[218]You can't have my brain. I'm using it. \n[219]I would! \n[220]Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!! \n[221]What are they-- what's in the food?! \n[222]Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING \n[223]You want the question that goes with the answer \"42\" How about \"What's six times seven?\" Or \"How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\" Or here's one, \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" \n[224]Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...? \n[225] \n[226]I thought I was...what are       I thought I was...I'll get you... get back... okay          it... you already... fine, fine...                          fine They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes... \n[227]Thank you. \n[228]Yes.   Me. \n[229]Yes, You name it. I'll go.
