There's a beautiful river there also named Odessa. \n[5]I named you after Walter Matthau \n[6]So the moving bill came, for my move down here. I wanted to bring it by. Thank you so much Walter. \n[7]Hi, Walter. \n[8]Oh, I'm just making some yogurt. With some banana. \n[9]It snowed today. Didn't expect that. Not much. Just a light little cover. Very pretty. Less than an inch even. \n[10]My piano got towed, Walter. \n[11]Yes. Odessa said it wasn't there. Where you said it was going to be. \n[12]She said possibly that it got towed.

Big warlord of the fortieth floor-- \n[18]I was just discussing them. Last week. They rule over small areas of land using threats, and force bribes of livestock or klipspringers. \n[19]Yes. \n[20]In some parts of the world they carry small deer like we carry, say, quarters. To pay bribes. Also, blankets or clothing items like koofiyads. \n[21]Yes, for the warlords. \n[22]Yes? \n[23]Sean? \n[24]No. I took it. With Sean's camera. \n[25]From Sean. He came to visit. \n[26]He came to visit. To talk about you. \n[27]Yeah. He asked me some questions about you? What your work schedule was, when you left, when you came home. He said you really understood Life. He wanted to know about your work. He said you \"got Life.\" \n[28]I just sent him my recipe for Clementine cake? To his email. I packed him some when he left. He just loved it. We snacked on some during our Warlord conversation. \n[29]He's in Nepal now, I think. Photographing snow leopards. Let me think. Yes. Ship. Iceland. Mogadishu. Nepal. That's what he said. \n[30]I didn't know that. You don't talk about work that often. \n[31]I was concerned we couldn't keep it, Dear. I know it's a burden. I didn't know if we could manage. So I thought I might not see it again. I wanted a picture. \n[32]That's not a very good picture. But that's okay. She's right here. \n[33]You know, I wonder sometimes... you had to start work so early. Orange Julius. Then all through college. At Avis. Then Pizza delivery. That shitty pizza. Then at this company. \n[34]I wish maybe you had the chance, a greater chance to pursue your dreams. \n[35]What did you want to be, when you younger? \n[36]Sure you do.

Where it was sent from? \n[42]Yeah, the guy who took this-- \n[43]...I'm getting nervous with these new guys around. Lost negative. But I'm not going to freak out. I think my work here the last nine years speaks for itself. I've made my mark. \n[44] \n[45]What is this? \n[46]I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box. \n[47]It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost. \n[48](looking at the out of \n[49]The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off. \n[50]No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him. \n[51]These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these. \n[52]Not yet. Because my trail is... water. \n[53]A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. And a man  thumb. \n[54]I've been trying to figure out the gender , as I sat here. How many people in the world? \n[55]Everyone's got two, too. \n[56]Thumbs. \n[57]Look what Sean gave me. \n[58]Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... ...boldly \n[59]You guys covered the hotspots together boldly? \n[60]As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format. \n[61]We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you? \n[62]It's a sign of disdain here. \n[63]They've been targeting western journalists all summer.

But it didn't work. \n[66]No, it says \"unable to perform request,\" Todd. So I don't think my wink really went through. Do I have like a broken page or something? \n[67]Well, okay, something's not working. On my page. \n[68]Any what? \n[69]...I don't have any dimensions? \n[70]I don't want to be one now. I just am one. \n[71]It's an occupation. When I became an adult I thought that would be possibly a good thing to have. Because I keep getting bills from places. \n[72] \n[73]April. \n[74]Yeah.

I have a piano situation I have to take care of. \n[78]Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back? \n[79]Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York? \n[80]Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old. \n[81]My sister's not the responsible one in the family. \n[82]She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off. \n[83]36. \n[84]Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that. \n[85]I used to skateboard a little. \n[86]Maine. When I was a kid. Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it. \n[87]You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich.

It's not as close as Canada but it's really not as far as it sounds. When you hear it. Look. \n[112]  \n[113]This looks like a chair.

We're in a transition period and-- \n[150]...Can't we just call them? I could ask him on like the boat phone. \n[151]Can I just ask him on the \"ship to shore?\" Instead of going on that old-looking helicopter? \n[152]You're leaving now? \n[153]The weather doesn't seem great.

The time you told me I have no personality? \n[190]Well, I take my work seriously. Also keeping a tidy apartment. I help my sister out paying her bills now and then. But can we not list that? None of that stuff really seems like an accomplishment. \n[191]Braces. \n[192]She hasn't asked me for rent money. For like a year. But I did pay for her braces. She's 36. \n[193]I fought a dolphin. \n[194]Yeah. \n[195]They are. I think they're probably the best mammal. \n[196]This mammal tried to protect me. And most of the other mammals I know, like the mammals at the office, they're dicks. \n[197]I'm on a ship. \n[198]Near Greenland. I tracked a thumb here. To Nuuk, Greenland. I located the thumb. Now I'm fortunately going to Iceland to correct an oversight. \n[199]It was just one. \n[200]Okay, Todd. \n[201]Do I? Because I think I'm a little worse. \n[202]So. Okay. I'm supposed to kayak in? \n[203]....shit. \n[204]Fuck. Sorry. \n[205] \n[206]What's up? \n[207]Okay. Cool. \n[208]That's awesome. \n[209]...Your piano got towed? \n[210]I lent her money for that space. \n[211]In Iceland. \n[212]My mom's piano. \n[213](doesn't really understand \n[214]It's a piano. \n[215]It's right out there. I just walked by it. Do you have more than one piano? \n[216]It's a piano. \n[217]It's not a car. Its a musical instrument. I should have had my musical instrument inspected? By a government. \n[218]We can't move into my mom's until tomorrow. \n[219] \n[220]Don't worry about it. \n[221]Yes. \n[222]No. \n[223]I tried to join, but-- I don't really even want to be on it. I'm just trying to do this thing with someone at work. \n[224]I'm trying to do that Pi\u00f1a Colada thing? \"If you like Pi\u00f1a Coladas, and getting caught in the rain while wearing a cape--\" \n[225]Well, the guy answers a personal ad and finds out it's his wife. They have a good laugh, then they make love on the cape while drinking Pi\u00f1a Coladas or something, and wearing capes, I think. Anyway. I'm hoping she'll click my profile and not realize that she works in my office area. Then we can realize it and have a good laugh. Then-- \n[226]No, then we can know that we picked each other out, you know, from the whole planet. Not just the cafeteria. \n[227]... We're friends. I'd like there to be more. \n[228]I was hoping this web site (that they won't let me be on) would show her more. \n[229]I don't know. What do you think it is? \n[230]We better tell them they need to shift that over to outside the big room. \n[231](sensing there is going to \n[232]Hey, Odessa? \n[233]You know when I asked you to pick the apartment out for Mom, you understood that she was taking her piano along. \n[234] \n[235]Did you enjoy that juice drink? That you were making (for some reason) simultaneous to me talking to you about important matters? So, okay, right now the piano is hanging in the air, above a city, we can't fit it in here, and I'm not sure I can afford to move it anywhere else. So I hope you enjoyed that juice drink. \n[236]We can't. It's the only thing she really wanted to take along. I think it's really best for her. She can still play. Reading's not that easy for her now. She doesn't really have any friends in New York. \n[237]What's that move-in like. In terms of deposits and-- for Villa living? In a Villa situation? \n[238]How much should I make this deposit for today? To reserve it. \n[239]\n[240]Where's that frigging Clementine cake wrapper thing... \n[241] \n[242]I almost found someone I was looking for. For work. In Iceland. This is where he's going next. I just don't know where it is. Warlock. Little weird deer. Like kind of a fez-style hat. \n[243]That's what these things are. Klipspringer. Koofiyad. I just don't know what they add up to. I put them all in Google nothing comes up. \n[244] \n[245] \n[246]Oh. Hey. \n[247]You know we haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I know you're deciding who's vital to the transition. And I wanted to let you know what I do-- \n[248]I am. Totally. \n[249]...It's my birthday. \n[250]No... Um, my sister gave me these. \n[251]My... \n[252]His arms and legs stretch outward. Um. But that's not-- I wanted, before we have the chance to talk, I need to discuss an asset situation with you. \n[253]I've processed the digitization of every single photograph in Life's library. Two million and eleven. But we haven't been able to locate this last negative. \n[254]I'm confident we'll find it. \n[255]Yes. \n[256]I've been here nine years-- \n[257]Helmut Newton didn't-- \n[258]I didn't Helmut Newton you. \n[259]I didn't Helmut Newton anyone. I was saying I haven't misplaced a negative in nine years. I've handled every negative in our library and prepared them for our archive. I've overseen their digitization, catalogued each photographer's period-specific film and photo equipment. And I've managed the preservation of the original vision of each photograph. I've never mishandled a single nega- \n[260]I know where he is. Sean. \n[261]Somewhere-- I haven't pieced it together, somewhere were there are little deers and Warlocks. \n[262]Yes. \n[263]\n[264]Did you call me Cubicle? \n[265]Well, yeah, but I'm not named after one. \n[266]Mom, why are you-- did you need something? \n[267]Yeah. \n[268]...thanks, Mom. \n[269]Warlord? \n[270](strange, his mom's using \n[271]Why did you just say that word? \n[272] \n[273](something important has \n[274]I feel funny. Why is this happening? \n[275]I need to buy a ticket, I think to Dubai. Because I'm going, actually, to Mogadishu  which I think, I'm not allowed to do from here, because it's illegally dangerous. \n[276]Here you go. Whoa, what do you have in there? \n[277]I like your trucks. I used to skateboard. Where are you guys headed? \n[278]Hey, do you guys know anyplace to stay, that's not like an arm and a leg. \n[279]Business center. \n[280]Do you know-- are there American journalists working here? What would someone want to photograph here? \n[281]Who's evacuating? \n[282] \n[283]Like right now? \n[284]...Sean? \n[285]Sean? \n[286]Sean O'Connell? \n[287]Hey. Walter Mitty. From the office. \n[288]...Yeah. Hey. Man, I've really been trying to reach you. Hey. It's good to finally meet you. Thanks for the wallet, man, by the way. Sean, do you happen to know where that negative 12 is. 2-6? On the roll three? \n[289]You know what, we don't. I've looked in every neg box and even every camera bag and we have in the warehouse. I even double-checked the Teaneck warehouse. \n[290]I really don't. \n[291]Loan you... what? \n[292] \n[293]Do you have any sense how I could get back to America if I can't afford a plane ticket right now? Totally? \n[294]I give your brother two dollars and then he'll tell me how to get back to America? \n[295]...I can go to America for two dollars? \n[296]Hey, Todd. It's Walter. Mitty. \n[297]Hey I wanted to add a couple items? \n[298]To my Been There, Done Thats. If that's cool. \n[299]Okay. Mogadishu? \n[300]Been there. \n[301]Cheryl Mellhoff. \n[302]Walter Mitty. \n[303]Thanks. \n[304]Hey. \n[305]Almost... \n[306]...I'm okay. \n[307](gesturing with the Arabic \n[308]I got the board in Dubai. Hey, Rich. Here watch. The board's going to come up. You don't have to try to lift it. \n[309]You really just have to think about landing. Both feet. Same time. \n[310]No, I lost him. He said I had it though. Like he knew. He smiled. He said \"you have it.\" \"You.\" What's he talking about? \n[311]  \n[312]Excuse me. Can you pass key me in? I need to see Ted. My pass key isn't working. I need to let him know I verified that I have negative 12. I just didn't verify where I have it. \n[313]Yes. \n[314]Yes. \n[315]I need to speak to Ted. I found \n[316]Is there someone who took over Ted's responsibilities? On a \n[317]Yes. \n[318]I didn't lose it. I have it. The photographer told me. I just don't know where I have it. \n[319]Those are no grounds. You can't fire me for not having something that I have. \n[320]I have it. I always have had it. When you fired me, I had it. Why are you trying to hit me with Squash balls? \n[321]No one's informed me that I've been let go. \n[322]I should be sent my November check. \n[323]There's no cause to keep my salary. Ow. \n[324]I'd like to speak to your supervisor. \n[325]I demand to speak to your supervisor. \n[326]I'd like to demand to speak to your supervisor. \n[327]The Purpose of Life-- \n[328]Hey, fuck you, man. \n[329] \n[330]  \n[331]    \n[332]....Mom? \n[333]Hey, did-- did a guy take a picture of your piano? Like a week ago? \n[334] \n[335]Where did you get Sean's camera? \n[336]Sean O'Connell? \n[337]Me? \n[338]Do you know where-- \n[339]Man, I've been desperately searching for him. For a long time. Thanks, mom. \n[340]I know. I don't want you to worry. It's not always cool and easy. ... why did you take a picture of your piano? \n[341] (meaning no one really \n[342]...I don't even remember. \n[343] \n[344]What are you? \n[345]Cool. \n[346]Thanks, man. \n[347]Grammy. Best male R &amp; B vocal performance. \n[348]You, too. \n[349]That's okay. \n[350] \n[351]...Not one? \n[352]I'm trying to locate a photographer. \n[353]The information I have (from my mom) is that he's working with a guide named Stepit. Any idea... is that enough of a clue where they might be? I know they're photographing snow leopards, and this is the snow leopard region-- \n[354]I need to go there. \n[355]Didn't you just say that only that other guy can take you through there? Safely? \n[356]Yes. \n[357]This way? \n[358]Aren't you coming? \n[359]That's-- that's how you're guiding me? By pointing and saying go that way? \n[360]...Hello. \n[361](they know each others \n[362]Not much. \n[363]Okay. Cool. \n[364]Great, man. \n[365]It even sounds cold? \n[366]Nepal. \n[367]I don't really do a lot of, you know, swinging. \n[368]Yeah. \n[369]Oh. I don't mean that. \n[370]I meant like partying, I guess. I used to like to be at work at 8. And I have some family demands that keep me pretty busy. \n[371]Yeah. \n[372](not in the mood for \n[373]Well, I'm not going to move and let the people who lean on me fall, because the people who lean on me are my mom and my sister. \n[374]A little. \n[375]I don't get a lot. But I guess if I had to say - mostly I just consider thoughts... for my visions for ideas and scenarios about the world. \n[376]Yeah. \n[377]...Sean? \n[378] \n[379]Cool. \n[380]Sean O'Connell? \n[381]Walter. Mitty. \n[382]I've been looking for you. \n[383]Yeah, warming up. \n[384]Hey, Sean. I really need that picture. I'm taking a lot of heat at work. Over that. \n[385]Yeah. \n[386]Why am I sitting on it? \n[387]I thought that meant inside the wrapping paper. I never opened it. Goddmanit. The wallet. I left the-- \n[388]Oh, yeah... Fuck. \n[389]I-- can you believe it - I just this morning I put it in a receptacle thing. \n[390]Well, I didn't know I was throwing that out, but... yeah. \n[391]I just didn't believe in Life's Purpose anymore. So I fucking (I cannot believe it) chucked it. \n[392]No... \n[393]No. \n[394]Oh. \n[395]...We may have to sell Mom's piano, in order to pay for the Villa. This week. \n[396]Yeah. \n[397]It's \"f\"d up. I know. But if I don't get my severance I'm going to have to forfeit that deposit, because I can't afford the room. And I won't have enough to get her another place. Another decent place. \n[398]Yeah. \n[399]Almost? \n[400]Nothing I just want everyone in the world to be Morgan Freeman. So it would just be me and Morgan Freemans, in the whole world. \n[401]You'd be you. But like a combo with him. Just a little calmer, more quiet. Gentler. \n[402]Yeah. \n[403]Los Angeles. \n[404]I'm okay. I'm going to take the train to my hotel. Try to get home tomorrow. \n[405]I love you, too. \n[406]I'm sorry. \n[407]What's a summit pass? \n[408]I'm trying to get to my hotel. \n[409]My boss, the guy who runs my company is here. Is it cool if I talked to him. Am I allowed? \n[410]There's a work situation I want to clue him in on. I was let go with cause. But there wasn't-- \n[411]Sir, can I have two secs? Mr. Chatham, Can I have two secs? I'm a former employee of one of your companies. Mitty? \n[412]Just two secs? Former employee? Mitty? I was let go with cause.

I'm a man who used to work for your company. \n[465]I don't know. I was in jail. We didn't get TV. \n[466]Can I just talk to you for two secs.? \n[467]There was one absent from the roll. But I have it. \n[468]Yeah. For the last issue. That's the complete roll. \n[469] \n[470]That last one's pretty late. Nine days late. There was an unforeseen set of unbelievable shit that happened. \n[471]I sit way in the back. Maybe that's- \n[472]It's a pretty intense burn. It's like having Cajun eyes. Spicy eyes. \n[473]Was that a question? \n[474]I guess I was revved up. \n[475]From fighting with a piano for a month and trying to get someone at my company to evaluate my position there based on understanding what I actually do. \n[476]Not in the way that I fought the mailbox, but just in the way that I've been struggling with one. \n[477]Yes. \n[478]Yes. \n[479] \n[480]Yeah. \n[481]  \n[482]Walter Mitty? Is there a... possibly there's a severance package for me? \n[483]I was fired for cause, but then I think I maybe gave them cause to provide me with a severance package. \n[484]Okay. Possibly there's that? For me? \n[485]I'll be right out. \n[486]All done. \n[487]Everybody's good. \n[488]How's Life? \n[489]Both. \n[490]Yeah. \n[491]I'm excited.
