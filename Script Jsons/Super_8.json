He drove onto the tracks. Maybe there was something-- -- he wanted to destroy, he wanted to destroy? yeah. \n[97]He had a gun, why not use that? \n[98]Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook. \n[99]... sure. \n[100]I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid. 51. \n[101]You wanna see it? Later? The... train? My train model? The train I made? \n[102]Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul. Someone with no soul, dead eyes. Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin? \n[103]-- like her. But hungry, like hungry for human flesh. To make them turn into zombies, because that's what zombies do. \n[104]Oh my God. That's really good... \n[105]... not bad. \n[106]Lucy. Lucy. Lucy! \n[107]Lucy! ...

Over. \n[113] \n[114]Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over. \n[115]  \n[116]Oh gawd, I didn't clean up. \n[117]Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV. \n[118]This is the train they wanna destroy. \n[119]That's dry brush technique.  After you've painted the base color, you take something like...  Euro Gray. \n[120]There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off. 63. \n[121]My dad gave it to her the day I was born. She wears it all the time. Used to. It was bad, how she-- died and stuff, but they got the necklace back. So. \n[122]We're sitting right here. \n[123]I thought you were calling Evan. \n[124]Military police investigation. It was a suicide. \n[125]A former Air Force officer. He called me last night, said he had a secret that he couldn't keep any longer. 66. \n[126]He worked at Romero Chemical. He found out some things the company's been doing. After what you told me at the bar, I thought you should know. \n[127]We just made the discovery ourselves. You understand this is top secret. \n[128]I would never have given you this information if you and I hadn't served together in Vietnam. \n[129] \n[130]  \n[131]We're not clear. \n[132]We're not clear.

That I'm not going to let you blow up my train? \n[148]What's your problem? \n[149]I know, my dad's being a turkey. 79. \n[150]We're still gonna finish your movie! \n[151]What are you talking about? Of course it is. \n[152]Why? \n[153]I'll get the camera back, I know where my dad put it -- We can still make the festival. \n[154]Then what is it about? \n[155]What's obvious? \n[156]-- what? \n[157]Your movie was over! That's what you said! You were upset. I gave you a camera! I helped you! \n[158]What's your problem? \n[159]Well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie! 81. \n[160]What do you even care what I think about Alice?! \n[161]-- wait, you like Alice Dainard? \n[162] Guys, look out! \n[163]We can make another train and blow that one up. \n[164]I do like her.

That means it's real. \n[117] \n[118]We can use this -- we can film it -- \n[119]--okay-- \n[120]If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again. \n[121]She was mint, but she's never gonna do it. \n[122]There's no way. You heard what she said. \n[123]You honestly think she cares about the scenes? \n[124]Man, did you hear what she said last night? \"I never should have done this!\" Dude, she was totally wigged! \n[125]Did you see her face? \n[126]Man, what's wrong with you? \n[127]Lens is cracked.
