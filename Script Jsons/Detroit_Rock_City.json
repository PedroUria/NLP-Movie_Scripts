That's Jeremiah! \n[8]Jeremiah Bruce from school. He and his mom just went into that church. He must be in Detroit for the concert. Can I go say good-bye to him? \n[9]I'm not going to wander. I'm just gonna go over there. \n[10]He's with his mom. \n[11] \n[12]Believe it. \n[13]I have a confession. Here it is. \n[14]I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me. \n[15]I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it. \n[16]You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam! \n[17]We've got to take this slow... \n[18]Oh, screw it! \n[19]So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long? \n[20]Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right? \n[21]I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here. \n[22]My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out. \n[23]I pass by this really cool tee-shirt shop on my way to school every day and I know you wear those black tee- shirts all the time. You look like a size thirty-five, but all the sizes were in Roman numerals. So I got you an XXXL. That's thirty-five, isn't it? \n[24]Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right? \n[25]That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know? \n[26]Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam. \n[27]  ", "Mrs.": "\n[1]      \n[2]KISS! The devil's music! \n[3] \n[4] \n[5]The devil's body count, that's what's up! Don't you know what KISS stands for? \"Knights in Satan's Service!\" \n[6]Jeremiah, what are you doing? \n[7]You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon. \n[8]It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags. \n[9]Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis. \n[10]Someday you'll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots. \n[11]Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences? \n[12]You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome. \n[13]Give me that microphone... Jeremiah, you get your sorry self down to this office, mister! \n[14]I found some things in the pockets of your jacket while I was picking up your disgusting laundry today... \n[15]Cigarettes! Marijuana! Prophylactics! \n[16]And something much, much worse! \n[17]If you know what's good for you, you'll get down here... NOW! \n[18]I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot. \n[19]What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less! \n[20]And if the \"guys\" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things. \n[21]It's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve. \n[22]  \n[23]Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you. \n[24]What?! \n[25]If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it. \n[26]  \n[27]Again, many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice. \n[28]God bless you, Father McNulty. \n[29]I don't know how you got here tonight and I don't want to know either. All I know is you're going to pay dearly for this one, young man! \n[30]Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah. \n[31]Can we talk, Father? I'm desperate. My son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous KISS concert. \n[32]Now it's been a while since my boy had holy confession. Could you...? \n[33]It's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all. No son of mine is going to be a career musician. \n[34]Thank you, Father. I'll be back for him before you know it; after I take care of some unfinished business. \n[35]Drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man. You are in a world of... \n[36] ", "Bumsteen": "", "Priest": "\n[1]Thank you/Come again next week. \n[2]Next mass is tomorrow morning, sister. \n[3]In that case, come right in. \n[4]Uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow morning, young lady. Run along now. \n[5] \n[6]Just knock loudly, sister. \n[7]Come along, son. Get into the booth. \n[8]Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession? \n[9]That's it? \n[10]Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed? \n[11]Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while. \n[12]Where are you, son? \n[13]Oh. So, have you thought of a colorful confession yet? \n[14]Boooring. Think, boy, think! \n[15]Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute. \n[16]No... \n[17]Oh, this is terrible... Please go on. \n[18]Well? Continue! Continue! \n[19]Was it a teddy? \n[20]A bustier? \n[21]Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie. \n[22]Satin underwear? Crotchless panties? Leopard skin bra? Fishnet leotard? Leather G-string? ", "Elvis": "\n[1]Could that be three detentions I smell? \n[2] \n[3]Why you little...! Over my dead body! \n[4]Excuse me, ladies. \n[5]KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. A nice, fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening's plans. \n[6]Looking for something, rodents? \n[7]Nooooo!! \n[8]  \n[9] \n[10] \n[11]Boys, this time... I win! ", "Kenny": "\n[1]Stop singing... NOW! \n[2]Stop the friggin' car NOW! \n[3]Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did? \n[4]\n[5]Lemme paint you a friggin' picture ahright? Imagine if you will a 1978 Pontiac Trans American in pristine condition. An appealing portrait, nesspah? \n[6]BUT WAIT! What's that spec on the windshield? Could it be a wad of melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and various friggin' meat products? \n[7]And if it ain't cleaned off? \n[8] \n[9]You're a smart little homo, aren't you, hippie girl? But, while astounded at your nimble, friggin' insight, I still detect an issue hanging fire, namely: where does a sharp-witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that there? \n[10]No really, I'm perplexed. I mean, could you have done stupider if you were born without a FUCKIN' HEAD?! \n[11]Shut-up, Christine! \n[12]Are you gettin' wise with me? \n[13]Oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy ass punk. But please, allow me to clean the friggin' windshield. I insist. \n[14]There. Nice and clean. \n[15]Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band! \n[16]A bunch of guys who make bad music, dress like freaks, and wear more make-up than all my sisters combined? These assholes must be stopped! \n[17]Kool and the Gang, now there's real music. \n[18]But this... is crap! \n[19]So. All that having been said and done, I believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. Namely: Have you learned your lesson yet, puke? \n[20] \n[21]Oh, yeah...? \n[22]That's not what your mother said last night. \n[23]Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what your mother said last night. She said that I was the fuck of her life. \n[24] \n[25]  ", "Hawk": "\n[1]Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great crowd. But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on top of that, I'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies. \n[2]Lex, quit trying to always jinx things. Don't worry, dudes. Nobody's missing that concert tomorrow night. \n[3]Jam, listen up. \n[4]Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary. \n[5]Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana. \n[6]Anyway, listen up. They're gone! \n[7]The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm! \n[8]Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now! \n[9] \n[10]Trip, he took your jacket by mistake. You must be wearing Jam's. \n[11] \n[12]Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what? \n[13]Both you assholes, SHADDAP! \n[14]Enough of the mom-bashing, all right? Lex's mom is cool about us crashing over here while she's out of town. And if it weren't for Trip's mom, we wouldn'ta smoked that fine Panama Red last night. So leave the women who gave you life out of it. They're both cool. \n[15]Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead. \n[16] \n[17]Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them. \n[18]They're what? \n[19]All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City. \n[20]As they say in the Tampon biz, see you next period. \n[21]  \n[22]What are you, high? \n[23]For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here. \n[24]Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there! \n[25]You're way out of your league, Elvis. \n[26]We're clear, dudes. \n[27]A skirt just came around the corner. \n[28]That's Sherry VanHafton. \n[29]Whoa... she just farted. \n[30]Weird... \n[31]Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away. \n[32]Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off. \n[33]Fuckin' A! Woooooo! \n[34] \n[35]I'm afraid our constipated little friend is right this time, Trip. There is a catch. \n[36]Our band \"Mystery\" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere. \n[37]So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check? \n[38]Damn straight we are. \n[39]And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway? \n[40]Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit. \n[41]There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero? \n[42]Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check? \n[43]Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence. \n[44]I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand. \n[45]Curly. \n[46]Ok, dudes, follow my lead. \n[47]As I was saying, follow my lead. And maintain. Elvis just showed up. \n[48] \n[49]Yeah, Elvis... \n[50]..Your ass on a lunch tray. \n[51]On your marks and... \n[52]Fire! \n[53]Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog. \n[54]Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think. \n[55]Yeah, I'm Philip McNutly. \n[56]Ten even. \n[57] \n[58]Tell the Big Guy not to mention it. \n[59]Shit! This is such a lousy view. How the hell are we gonna know when he's lit? \n[60]It's okay, we're old buds of Father McNulty... How's it hangin', padre? \n[61]That was another dude. Anyway, we're here to take our bud Jam to the big satanic KISS concert tonight. Okay with you? \n[62]Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City! \n[63]Shit! Anybody know how long it takes to fix a flat? \n[64]Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed. \n[65]Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo. \n[66]What's in Sandusky? \n[67]Only a car full of guidos and stellas would ride someone's ass on a two- lane road and beep. \n[68]What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam? \n[69]What the fuck! \n[70]Hey, disco dude, it's cool... \n[71]Could be. \n[72]It could... bake on? \n[73]Okay, Kenny? I don't mean to drain your keg or anything, but could you speed up this process? Don't get me wrong, we'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever, but we're also on a schedule. So step on it. \n[74]No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado? \n[75]Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. \n[76]Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut. \n[77]It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me... \n[78]...what exactly did my mother say last night? \n[79]You heard me, prick. What did my mother say last night? \n[80] \n[81]Right, stella, and we'll deserve it. But let's really make it worth their while. \n[82]By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote. \n[83]Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. \n[84]Well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a KISS concert. But if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny. \n[85] \n[86] \n[87]You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. \n[88]Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car! \n[89]Why don't you kiss my hairy crack? \n[90](pointing out windshield \n[91]Ample time to grab our tickets at the station. See, up ahead. W.A.R.P. \n[92]Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes. \n[93]What was that D.J.'s name again? \n[94]Simple Simon? \n[95]We're right behind you, Simo. Just wanted to thank you in advance for handing over those burly-ass tix me and my buds won this morning. \n[96]Well, here we are, dudes. One hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century... ticketless. All thanks to Wile E. Coyote, Super- Fucking Genius over here. \n[97]Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense. \n[98]Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you? \n[99]I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say? \n[100] \n[101] \n[102]Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm. \n[103]Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet. \n[104]Now listen up. Here's the game plan. \n[105]Cool, bro, now listen up... \n[106]Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got... twenty-five. \n[107]Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us. \n[108]So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck! \n[109] \n[110]Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan. \n[111]Still too risky for my money. We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection... \n[112]...at twenty-thirty hours. \n[113]For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there. \n[114]Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it. \n[115]See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later. \n[116]Dude, this is all I got. \n[117]Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour? \n[118]I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin. \n[119]Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me. \n[120]Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man. \n[121] \n[122]Hawk. \n[123]Got any KISS? \n[124]Yeah, a man's drink... \n[125]...Dickey. \n[126] \n[127] \n[128]Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all. \n[129]Whoa... she is a killer. \n[130]Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't... \n[131]I-I c-can't... \n[132]You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its head and Do it for KISS. \n[133]Wow. I feel a hundred times better! \n[134]Thanks lady. \n[135]Maestro? As you were. \n[136]Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment! The show must go on! \n[137]Thanks, miss. \n[138]Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore. \n[139]Huh? \n[140]No shit, dude, is this really worth it? Sure you get your ass kicked nine ways to Sunday by that fucking gorilla, but it's still a hundred times better than getting it porked for the next three to five. \n[141]Thanks. \n[142]What the hell is that? \n[143]Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself. \n[144]Who's Whiskey Dick? \n[145]My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw... \n[146]...holy shit! \n[147]Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. What's next? Projectile diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh? \n[148]You love him? \n[149]No, I mean... you love your son? \n[150]And he loves you back, doesn't he? \n[151]Well, shame on him if he doesn't. \n[152]My mom died of a heart attack while she was having me. Man, I wish I had known her for even one day. If they ever invent a time machine, that's what I'm doing. Going back in time to meet my mom. I'm gonna say, \"Mrs. Pitchford?... or Miss Williams, depending on when I show up. You don't know me, but I'm your kid from the future. Just wanted to thank you for the blue eyes, pug nose and for tying the knot with a guy who didn't mind diaper detail... Oh, and, uh... cut down on the red meat, will ya?\" \n[153]Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me. \n[154]...Thanks. \n[155]Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be the last ticket! I hope you have another one for me! \n[156]Fuck me! \n[157]Any luck? \n[158]Tickets? \n[159]Well, dudes, the only way we're gonna see KISS this tour is by some fuckin' miracle. \n[160]Nah. Couldn't be. \n[161] \n[162] \n[163]Dude, you gotta let us in! Four muggers just stole our tickets! \n[164]           ", "Barbara": "\n[1]Oh, Christine! You googatz in the head or something? We're on the side of the freakin' highway! \n[2]When they wake up, they're gonna come looking for you jerks. You best hope they don't find you, cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses. \n[3]  \n[4]Very funny. I hope you choke! ", "Christine": "\n[1]Kenny, come on with the macho crap already. Like this kid could take you in a fight anyway. \n[2](using \"oh\" to mean \"enough\" \n[3]That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving! \n[4]Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there? \n[5] \n[6]Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby. \n[7] \n[8]Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids? \n[9]Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere. \n[10]The name's Christine, not stella. And there's no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer or KC and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS? \n[11]I can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ. \n[12]Whatever. Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. True, if I had to choose, I'd pick the category labelled disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance to. \n[13]Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony. \n[14]Yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is? \n[15]Why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it! \n[16]  \n[17]Man, this is some kickass shit! Gimme a hit off that jay will ya? \n[18]Then maybe you guys'll let me go, huh? \n[19]Come on, whadaya say? You scratch my back, I scratch yours. You let me go, and in return, I keep my big mouth shut about your little operation here. Mum, know what I mean? \n[20]You guys better kill me before you do what you're thinking of doing. Cause when I'm mad enough, I can bite down very hard. \n[21] \n[22]Wow! Thank you! You're cooler than the Fonz. \n[23]Come with. It's not too late for you to catch the fever. \n[24]Here's my number. Tell me how cool I am over the phone sometime. Okay? \n[25] ", "Bobby": "\n[1]Hey, Kenny, look! There's a hunk of fawkin' cheese on your windsheel! \n[2]Break his fawkin' legs, Kenny! \n[3]Let her go, Barbara, she'll come back to Kenny. She always does... Right, Kenny? \n[4]  ", "Jam": "\n[1]That was curly! \n[2]My mom? Oh, no! What's she doing here? \n[3]Oh, hi, mom. \n[4]What's up? \n[5]    \n[6]Hello? \n[7]Hawk? \n[8]  \n[9]It's my Bullworker. \n[10]What's gone? \n[11] \n[12]Whew! Oh, God, Hawk... I got'm! Somehow I musta taken Trip's jacket by mistake! \n[13]I'm really sorry about that, man. \n[14] \n[15]Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school. \n[16]    \n[17]Uhh... nothing. \n[18]Ahh, sunshine. \n[19]Change? What's wrong with what I got on? \n[20]But, mom! \n[21] \n[22]Grounded for the rest of the year? \n[23]Hey, my mom had me over a barrel, all right. After last night, I had to let her dress me today. It's a give and take relationship. \n[24]They're still at my house in Trip's jacket. \n[25]She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake. \n[26]Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem. \n[27]Check. \n[28]Oof! Sorry. \n[29]Thanks. \n[30]Beth? \n[31]Ow! \n[32]Just a little pink eye. No reason to panic. \n[33] \n[34]Yeah? \n[35]  \n[36]You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school? \n[37]Mom, three of those tickets don't even belong to me. They're for the guys. \n[38]  \n[39] \n[40]I said, I'm sorry! \n[41]Please, God, help. \n[42] \n[43]No, but I'm not hungry anyway. \n[44]Oh, man, my mom is gonna send me to Alcatraz for this and I don't even care! I'm gonna see Peter Criss's drum solo! \n[45]Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off? \n[46]Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's leave KISS out of it. Please. \n[47]Hey, look, it's that girl. \n[48]Stella or no stella, we should pull over and help her out. \n[49]Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again. \n[50]She's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway. They make very scary movies that start out like that. \n[51]It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. \n[52]Trip! That's so fuckin' rude, man. \n[53]Come on, Hawk. \n[54]Jam. \n[55] \n[56]Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me. \n[57]Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize. \n[58]Sometimes I think I don't deserve friends as good as you guys. \n[59]It was stolen! \n[60]I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do. \n[61]I got... \n[62] \n[63] \n[64]Oh... dear... Lord!! \n[65]Mom, what're we...? \n[66] \n[67]Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time. \n[68]Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy. \n[69]So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together. \n[70]Yeah. \n[71]No. \n[72] \n[73]Are you waiting for confession? I thought you were Jewish? \n[74]I don't care. I wanna hear more. \n[75]Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name. \n[76]Right, slow... \n[77]Uhh, tying my shoe. \n[78]Actually, yes. Last year I walked out of a candy store with a Reggie Bar I hadn't paid for, but went back and apologized the next day. \n[79]And what about that girl, Trip? She'll never forget this night. Even if you get away with it, she'll be scarred for life. When are you gonna realize sometimes being tough means being tender. \n[80]I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia. \n[81]Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that? \n[82]Ann Arbor? \n[83] \n[84]I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me. \n[85]Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour. \n[86]Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath. \n[87]No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that. \n[88]Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it. \n[89]Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time. \n[90]I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted. \n[91]Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again. \n[92]Bye. \n[93]I'm gonna ask you nicely first. Mom, can I have my drumsticks back? \n[94]Again, can I have my drumsticks? \n[95]I know, mom, I've been in trouble for about twelve hours now! Hellooooo!? \n[96]I'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at St. Bernard's Boarding School, remember?! I'm gonna be outta your hair till I'm a legal adult, remember?! That way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you can spend your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! That way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! And that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. Cause if you did, you'd realize what a LOUSY, GODDAMN, SHITTY- \n[97] \n[98]For the last time, mom. Let me have my fucking drumsticks. Please. \n[99]It's a miracle! A miracle! \n[100]Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak. \n[101]We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then. \n[102]Look at us! \n[103]This is it! \n[104]           ", "Lex": "\n[1]   \n[2]   \n[3]What the fuck, Trip? That's my bass! \n[4]  \n[5]Shit! It's Jam's mom! \n[6]  \n[7]I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it. \n[8]  \n[9]  \n[10]  \n[11]Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell. \n[12]Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD. \n[13]Trip, you fuckin' asshole. \n[14]You spilled my Sea Monkeys all over the bed. \n[15]Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs. \n[16] \n[17]Shit, that dork is Jam. \n[18]Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it. \n[19]If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year! \n[20]  \n[21]I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked! \n[22]Wanna bet. \n[23]Check! \n[24]Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember? \n[25]Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out. \n[26]Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug. \n[27]I've been in love with her since the second grade. \n[28]I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life. \n[29]Heh-heh, sorry. \n[30]Too bad we're stuck in electronics or... \n[31]We won?! \n[32]The Chinese have a proverb: \"That which appears too good to be true, usually is.\" There's gotta be a catch. \n[33]But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county! \n[34]We are not stealing my mom's car. \n[35]Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati. \n[36]Sunday, but... \n[37]Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us. \n[38]The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar \n[39]Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something. \n[40]Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school? \n[41]Hello summer detention. \n[42]Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine. \n[43]Now, how are we gonna do this? \n[44]Not looking like that, Mr. Rogers. \n[45]We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car. \n[46] \n[47]Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit? \n[48]Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery! \n[49]Holy shit! We just pissed off the Incredible Hulk, his idiot half brother and two circus clowns. \n[50] \n[51]Not so fast, stella. \n[52]Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse! \n[53]What is it with you, Jam? You got a thing for that... thing? \n[54]Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby. \n[55] \n[56]Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella. \n[57]Curly driving, Hawk. We still got two hours to spare. \n[58]Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change? \n[59]Yeah, it's like you're possessed by The Flying Nun, or something. \n[60]Uh... dudes? \n[61]\n[62] \n[63]I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it? \n[64]But we took the keys? \n[65]Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!? \n[66]Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation. \n[67] \n[68]...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble! \n[69]All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo. \n[70]I think we should try sneaking in. \n[71]Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all \"re-enter\" the concerto. Voila! \n[72] \n[73]Whoa. Danger Will Robinson. \n[74]Shit! \n[75] \n[76]\n[77]I can't believe you're even thinking of committing a robbery, Trip. You don't pass go and collect 200 dollars for pulling stuff like this. \n[78]This is real. This is not a dream! This is real! I've pierced the inner circle! \n[79]Oh, God, they're in there! \n[80] \n[81]Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This part's gotta be a nightmare! \n[82] \n[83] \n[84]Okay, okay, you're pissed off. I can see this. So... Maybe what we need... ah-ha. \n[85]Play some frisbee, poochies? \n[86] \n[87]Well, how do you like that? \n[88]Whoa! Whoa! \n[89] \n[90]   \n[91]I'm here for the girl and the car. You can try to stop me, but I must warn you, it may be hazardous to your health. \n[92]Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make... Hounds of hell? Say hello to dinner! \n[93]One foot out of that office and your asses are Alpo! \n[94]Aaaayyyyy! \n[95]You got a phone in there? \n[96]Call the cops. \n[97]This oughta be enough to get you to Disco Inferno, Christine. \n[98]No can do. But I made a promise to get you to that disco, and we KISS maniacs are men of our word. Besides... you're pretty cool... for a stella, I mean. \n[99]I found the Volvo. \n[100]No... You don't think...? \n[101]Come on, Elvis. We was only kiddin'. It's all in good fun. We run, you chase. Cat and mouse. You know. \n[102]           ", "Bruce": "\n[1]      \n[2]KISS! The devil's music! \n[3] \n[4] \n[5]The devil's body count, that's what's up! Don't you know what KISS stands for? \"Knights in Satan's Service!\" \n[6]Jeremiah, what are you doing? \n[7]You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon. \n[8]It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags. \n[9]Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis. \n[10]Someday you'll see the futility in forging a musical career with those idiots. \n[11]Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences? \n[12]You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome. \n[13]Give me that microphone... Jeremiah, you get your sorry self down to this office, mister! \n[14]I found some things in the pockets of your jacket while I was picking up your disgusting laundry today... \n[15]Cigarettes! Marijuana! Prophylactics! \n[16]And something much, much worse! \n[17]If you know what's good for you, you'll get down here... NOW! \n[18]I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot. \n[19]What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less! \n[20]And if the \"guys\" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things. \n[21]It's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve. \n[22]  \n[23]Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you. \n[24]What?! \n[25]If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it. \n[26]  \n[27]Again, many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice. \n[28]God bless you, Father McNulty. \n[29]I don't know how you got here tonight and I don't want to know either. All I know is you're going to pay dearly for this one, young man! \n[30]Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah. \n[31]Can we talk, Father? I'm desperate. My son was about to defy God by going to that blasphemous KISS concert. \n[32]Now it's been a while since my boy had holy confession. Could you...? \n[33]It's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all. No son of mine is going to be a career musician. \n[34]Thank you, Father. I'll be back for him before you know it; after I take care of some unfinished business. \n[35]Drumsticks are the least of your worries, young man. You are in a world of... \n[36] ", "Amanda": "\n[1]You're too kind. I'm Amanda. \n[2]Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities. \n[3]I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me. \n[4]Gin. \n[5]Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we? \n[6]Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody. \n[7]But you do know Premature Peter, don't you? Shame, I just bought these stockings. \n[8]Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick. \n[9]I just told you, he's a big, hairy... \n[10]More than anything in the world. \n[11]He's a little spoiled, but I know he does. \n[12]You're sweet. \n[13]  \n[14]I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer. \n[15]You're a good man, Hawk. Thank you. ", "Finch": ""}}
