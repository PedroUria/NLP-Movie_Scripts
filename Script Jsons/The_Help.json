I did. \n[4]Momma was a maid. My grandmother was a house slave. \n[5]I done raised seventeen kids in my life. Lookin' after white babies, that's what I do. \n[6]I know how to get them babies asleep, stop cryin' and go in the toilet bowl before they mommas even get outta bed in the mornin.' \n[7]Babies like fat. They like big fat legs too. That I know. \n[8]I work from eight to four, six days a week. Ninety-five cents an hour comes to a hundred seventy-two dollars ever month. I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing and grocery shopping, but mostly, I take care a baby girl...And law, I worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna be no beauty queen either. \n[9]You is kind. You is smart. You is important. \n[10]I reckon when you finish, it won't. \n[11]Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby Girl up but once a day. The birthin' blues had got holt a Miss Leefolt pretty hard. I done seen it happen plenty a times...once babies start havin' they own babies. And the young white ladies of Jackson...Oh, law, they was havin' some babies. \n[12]But, not Miss Skeeter... \n[13]No babies...No man...And not lookin'. \n[14]Miss Hilly was the first of the babies to have a baby. And it must a come out of her like the eleventh commandment. `Cause once Miss Hilly had a baby, ever girl at the bridge table wanted one too. 6. \n[15]Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard, Miss Hilly moved her and Minny in with her. Fired the maid she had just to make room. See, Minny about the best cook in Mississippi, and Miss Hilly wanted her. 7. \n[16]Minny my best friend. A old lady like me lucky to have her. \n[17]It's a tricky thing...you try to make a baby go in the toilet bowl before it's time. If theys can't get the hang of it, theys get to thinking low a theyselves. \n[18]You drunk up two glasses a grape juice, I know you got to tee-tee. \n[19]I give you a cookie if you go. \n[20]Mae Mobley! You going! 8. \n[21]I lost my own boy, Treelore, right before I started waitin' on the Leefolts... \n[22]After Treelore died, a bitter seed was planted inside a me. And I just didn't feel so accepting anymore. \n[23]Thank you, Miss Hilly. \n[24]Hold on! Those are Miss Hilly's. \n[25]Gots to have paprika on `em. \n[26]Watch yo mouth, Minny. \n[27]Oh, law! Did she? \n[28]Leefolt residence. \n[29]She having bridge club right now. May I take a message? \n[30]Yes, ma'am. \n[31]No, ma'am. \n[32]Miss Celia Foote called again. \n[33]Now, Miss Celia had her a man. `Bout the best lookin' man in all of Mississippi. But, no baby and no friends. 17. \n[34]Yes, ma'am. \n[35]Yes, ma'am. \n[36]Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times. Be good to get it right. \n[37]Yes, ma'am, it is. \n[38]Constantine and me...were in church circle together. 19. \n[39]Yes, ma'am. \n[40]Quit? \n[41]No, ma'am. I couldn't... \n[42]I knew I had said too much to Miss Skeeter, but Constantine's story weren't mine to tell. Some things a girl shouldn't have to know about her own mother. \n[43]Which one she want a get rid of? Them rings or the husband? \n[44]Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol soak. Then let it set in the sun a bit. \n[45]Bout an hour. Let it dry. \n[46]Everthing's fine. \n[47]I never tolt you that! \n[48]You know what'd happen to me if Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin' stories on her? \n[49]Other maids? \n[50]They set my cousin Shinelle's car on fire just cause she went down to the voting station. 33. \n[51]`Cause they's a reason. I do this with you, I might as well burn my own house down. \n[52]On top a Minny losin' her tenth job, eighteen people died in Jackson that day. Ten white. Eight black. \n[53]God don't pay no mind to color or class once he sets a tornado loose. \n[54]Soon after, that bitter seed inside of me had sprout and was growing fast... \n[55]Be right there, Baby Girl. \n[56]You got some \"Miss Myrna\" questions for me? \n[57]Yes, ma'am. 38. \n[58]This already ain't careful, Miss Skeeter. You not knowing that is what scares me most. I'm sorry. \n[59]I know pretty well what happens if the white ladies found out we was writing about them. Womens, they ain't like men. Women don`t beat you with a stick. Naw, they like to keep they hands clean. Got a shiny set a tools they use, sharp as witches' fingernails. \n[60]Any person printing, publishing or circulating written matter urging for public acceptance of social equality between whites and negroes is subject to imprisonment. \n[61]     \n[62]Everbody know you honest, Minny. \n[63]What you did?! \n[64]    \n[65]Minny! \n[66]   \n[67]  \n[68]Got dropped two streets over? \n[69]Thank you. 41. \n[70]I'm sorry. I've never had a white person in my house before. \n[71]Miss Skeeter, What if...What if you don't like what I got to say? About white peoples? \n[72]You gone have to change my name. Mine, Miss Leefolt's, everbody's. \n[73]It gone be hard. \n[74]Minny got her some stories, sho nuff. But, she ain't real keen on talking to white peoples right now. \n[75]  \n[76]It feel...Uh. \n[77]Yes, ma'am. He dead two years now. Got run over at the lumber yard. Lungs were crushed. \n[78]I'm sorry, I- \n[79]I thought I might write my stories down and read them to you. \n[80]It no different than writing down my prayers. \n[81]Prayer like electricity. It keep life going. Writing it down make it more powerful. Lot a ailing, sick peoples in this town. \n[82]I didn't get a chance to pray for Treelore. 43. \n[83]God took him fast `cause he didn't want to argue with me. He was just twenty-four years old. The best part of a person's life. \n[84]But he'd like we's doing this. He always said we gone have a writer in the family one day...After my prayers last night, I got some stories down too. \n[85]My first white baby to ever look after was named Alton Carrington Speers. It was 1938, and I'd just turned fourteen years old. Daddy had left us, so I dropped out a school to help momma with the bills. \n[86]Alton's momma died a lung disease. I loved that baby, and he loved me. That's when I learned I could make children feel proud of theyselves. \n[87]Alton used to always be asking me how come I's black... \n[88]  \n[89]It just ate him up, so one time I told him it cause I drank too much coffee. Oh, law, you should a seen his face. 44. \n[90]   \n[91]Yes, ma'am. \n[92]  \n[93]I reckon I'm ready...to talk about Miss Leefolt now. \n[94]Baby girl don't get her diaper changed `til I get there in the morning. That's `bout ten hours she gots to sit in her mess. I be so worried about her on my day off. I always come in an hour early on Mondays. \n[95]Miss Leefolt pregnant again, too. And, law, I pray this child turn out good. It a lonely road if a momma don't think theys child is pretty. \n[96]  \n[97]Miss Leefolt be spending so much time keeping up with the society ladies, she done forgot the child she got now. \n[98]We all working for the same thing. \n[99]You don't have to do this, Minny. \n[100]And that was a good mood. \n[101]  \n[102]Once Minny got to talking `bout food, she liked to never stop... \n[103]But when she got to talking about the white ladies, it took all night... \n[104]  \n[105]I know, but it hard, Minny. \n[106]You gone and done it now. 55. \n[107]  \n[108]Don't give up on us, Miss Skeeter. \n[109]You gone accuse me a philosophizing. \n[110]I don't believe in lines anymore. Lines is in our heads `cause people like Miss Hilly try to make us believe they there. \n[111]Lotta of folk think if you talk back to your husband, you crossed a line...need to be punished. \n[112]Cause it ain't there. `Cept in Leroy's head. Lines between black and white ain't there either. \n[113]All I'm saying is kindness don't have no boundaries. \n[114]Law, the Evers children have gotten so big! \n[115]No. You got me. \n[116]I'm on cut you some cake, Baby. \n[117]It so pretty. \n[118]Yes, ma'am. \n[119]Yes, ma'am...And I thank you. \n[120]One thing I got to say about Miss Hilly, she love her children. Always tellin' them they smart and beautiful. Can't go more than ten minutes without givin' one a kiss. \n[121]And, law, do they love her back. When she starts up on me, I just try and think a my sweet Treelore and how much he loved me. That kind a love makes me cry. Even when it going to Miss Hilly. \n[122]Baby girl home. 77. \n[123]I'm here, baby girl. Aibee's here. \n[124]You is kind. You is smart. You is important...You want me to tell you one a our secret stories? \n[125]One day this wise Martian come down to Earth to teach us people a thing or two. \n[126]Oh, he about six-two. \n[127]Martian Luther King. \n[128]Looked just like us, nose, mouth, hair on his head. But, sometimes people looked at him funny and were just downright mean to him. \n[129]`Cause he was green. \n[130]I be all right. My house is seven blocks from here. \n[131]Naw, thank ya. I'll be fine...Law, I hope this ain't as bad as- \n[132]We gone pray for the Evers. We gone pray for Myrlie. \n[133]We gone be careful. \n[134]We ain't doing civil rights with Miss Skeeter. We just tellin' stories like they really happen. \n[135]Happy Birthday! Mae Mobley two today! \n[136]You sure is, Baby Girl. Blow'em out `fo they run up in your grits. \n[137]Fifty-three. \n[138]Gone be fifty-four next week. \n[139]I gots seventeen of `em. \n[140]They all over town. \n[141]Now, you know who your momma is. \n[142]Everything okay? \n[143]  \n[144]Yule May in prison, Miss Skeeter. Gone be there four years. \n[145]  \n[146]The church gone send them boys to college. Gone pass the plate `til they graduate... \n[147]  \n[148]That's enough, Gretchen. \n[149]Get out a my house! \n[150]  \n[151]Tell her to pour vinegar in her trash cans. Then them dogs will stay away. \n[152]Today my birthday, Miss Skeeter. \n[153]And, from all over the county, my babies find they way home. \n[154]Some even from overseas. Alton Spears lives in Paris now. Married him a real pretty French girl. Got five kids, too...they's my grandbabies. 94. \n[155]I still don't drink coffee. Happy Birthday. Love Alton. \n[156]  \n[157]The world done gone crazy, Miss Skeeter! And I'm scared! What if folks find out what we writing? Figure out Niceville really Jackson, and figure out who who? \n[158]Y'all two gone sit there and tell me you one hundred percent without a doubt sure `bout all this?! \n[159]  \n[160]You trying to get yourself killed?! \n[161]  \n[162]Exactly! If people find out \"The Terrible Awful\" was you and Miss Hilly, then we in trouble. Trouble there ain't words for! \n[163]Lord have mercy. Ladies better hold onto they husbands tonight. \n[164]There's Skeeter and that must be Stuart. He's handsome... Missus Walters?! \n[165]Yes, ma'am. \n[166]    \n[167]Law, look at all them pages. Two- hundred and sixty-six of `em. \n[168]If your momma won't tell you, I reckon I will. \n[169]Constantine's story finally made it in our book. But the reason she got fired did not. Miss Skeeter just couldn't put that kind a shame on her own mother. \n[170]They printed a few thousand copies with the worst advance Miss Stein had ever seen. \n[171]We got four hundred dollars. Got another four hundred when it got printed. Divided thirteen ways that came to sixty-one fifty-three a person. \n[172]    \n[173]Minny got so excited she burnt up a skillet of chicken. \n[174]I...I wasn't paying attention. \n[175]Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny sit at the table. Aibileen's phone rings off the wall, but she won't answer. \n[176]Ever maid callin' to say they white lady's gone and bought the book. They so scared. \n[177]The voters of Hinds County had spoke. Mister Holbrook wasn't gone have no political career. \n[178]   \n[179]No. We ain't late. \n[180]Who we clappin' for? \n[181]  \n[182]Churches over two counties signed our books. All for you and me. \n[183]Doctor King signed it, too. He readin' our book. \n[184]What's wrong? \n[185]Congratulations! \n[186]What you mean you not takin' it? This is what you been dreaming of. \n[187]If bad things happen, they ain't nothing you can do about it. And if they happen, at least now theys a reason behind it. A reason we can wrap our heads around and be proud of... \n[188]Now, I don't mean to rub salt in your wound, but...you ain't got a good life here in Jackson. Plus, your momma's getting better- \n[189]Go find your life, Miss Skeeter. \n[190]Oh, Law! \n[191]Where are you now?! \n[192]I'm on come there now. \n[193]Minny, now, you listen to me. That baby gone be fine, and you ain't never gone lose your job. Mister Johnny told you that hisself. They's more book money coming. Your baby ain't gone know about gettin' beat. You hear me? You free, Minny! You are free. \n[194]You hear me? \n[195]Good morning. \n[196]It not polished good? Humidity been fighting me on polishing day. \n[197]Lemme...lemme go look in the kitchen, maybe I left some behind. \n[198]You check in Mae Mobley's bed? She been putting things- \n[199]I ain't stole no silver. \n[200]I go get her some syrup, Miss Leefolt. \n[201]I didn't steal no silver. \n[202]Woman!...I know something about you. Don't you forget that. \n[203]From what Yule May says, they's a lot a time to write letters from jail. Plenty a time to write ever person in Jackson the truth about you, and the paper is free. \n[204]I don't know. Already sold a lot a books. \n[205]Baby, you need to get back to bed. You got a fever. \n[206]I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry. \n[207]No, Baby, that's not the reason. I don't want to leave you, but...It's time for me to retire. You my last little girl. \n[208]Baby Girl, I need you to remember ever thing I told you. Okay? Do you remember what I told you? \n[209]No, Baby. The other. What you are. \n[210]That's right, Baby Girl. \n[211]Give my sweet girl a chance. \n[212]Mae Mobley was my last baby. In just thirty minutes, I felt like my whole life was done. Of the thirteen maids, seven of us got fired. Several other maids got fired who had nothin' to do with our book. Guess our stories weren't so unique after all...But, like Minny, we was all free. \n[213]And we's was a lot freer than Hilly Holbrook. \n[214]Ever so often, we all get a nice piece of book money in the mail. `Manna from heaven' we like to call it. \n[215]  \n[216]Thousands of our books went out all over the world. We had got paid to tell the truth and we just couldn't believe it... \n[217]Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck. As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much bigger, well furnished and beautiful. She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of \"The Help\" and \"All My Babies\" are placed side by side. At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom. She enters the bathroom and closes the door. ", "Clark": "", "Hilly": "\n[1]  \n[2]Minny! Go get Momma! \n[3]Minny, William took Billy out for ice cream. So, hurry back and get Billy down for his nap. No dilly dallying. \n[4]Hey, girls! 9. \n[5] Put Momma in a chair before she breaks a hip. \n[6]Aibileen, I want you to have this coat. It's too big for Momma now and it's way too expensive to put in the coat drive. \n[7]All yours. \n[8]Go on. Try it on. \n[9]About supper club tonight...Honey, Stuart had to cancel. \n[10]He can't get off the rig, Skeeter. It's offshore! Stuart is a very successful oil man. \n[11]One eye?! \n[12]They'd be a fool not to hire you. \n[13]Well, no! But, I bet the poor girls without any help, in South Jackson, read it like the King James. \n[14]What?! Oh, my gosh! Skeeter nods her head sadly. \n[15]I'm so sorry, Skeeter. \n[16]She can't take a hint, can she? \n[17]That tacky girl Johnny married. \n[18]Uh-hmm, worked concessions at a LSU game and sold him a hotdog. And, boy, he got a whole lot more. \n[19]And live thirty minutes outside of town? Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty parlor, and she had the nerve to ask if she could help with the children's benefit. \n[20]Yes, but we're not telling her. \n[21]Ah-hem. I'm fine. \n[22]If Aibileen uses the guest bathroom, I'm sure she uses yours too. \n[23]Wouldn't you rather them take their business outside? \n[24]-Tell Raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. It's just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. I double. \n[25]That's why I've drafted The Home Help Sanitation Initiative. 16. \n[26]As a disease preventative bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I've even notified the Surgeon General of Mississippi. I'll pass. \n[27]You ought not to joke about the colored situation. \n[28]I'll do whatever it takes to protect our town. Your lead, Jolene. \n[29]Build it just like the one at my house, right against the garage. \n[30]Oh, mercy! \n[31]That should do it. Minny, go get me and Momma some iced tea. \n[32]Yes. \n[33]Oh, for crying out loud. It's just a little rain. She can go get an umbrella up in William's Study! \n[34]Minny? \n[35]MINNYYYY, are you in there? \n[36]Are you sitting down? \n[37] \n[38]We're running behind on our \"coat drive,\" girls. So hurry up and clean out those closets...But our Christmas Benefit, however, is right on schedule as y'all have already filled all our baked goods raffle slots. \n[39]Y'all think we can put a dent in the African Children's hunger this year? \n[40]Now for some exciting news...I wanted y'all to be the first to know...My William is seeking election to the State Senate this November! \n[41]He's runnin' on a platform of health. Protecting our children. Protecting our way of life. So, I, with William, have drafted The Home Health Sanitation Initiative. 45. \n[42]Skeeter, when can we expect to see the initiative in the newsletter? I gave it to you a month ago. \n[43]Would you please stand, Skeeter? \n[44]He's coming! Oh, Skeeter, he's definitely coming this time. This Saturday night. \n[45]Don't you dare say that! \n[46]It's your time, Skeeter. And damnit, I'm not going to let you miss this just because your mother convinced you you're not good enough for somebody like him. \n[47]Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. Yule May, get Miss Skeeter a Coca Cola. \n[48]Skeeter, you don't even have on lipstick! 62. \n[49]Well...What do you think of him? \n[50]Seven. \n[51]Honey, you're beautiful. Just go on out there...you're gonna do great. It's your time, Skeeter. I just know it. \n[52]\"Roll Tide.\" We still love him. \n[53]William! The Lieutenant Governor just walked in. \n[54]We'd love your support on election day! \n[55]Thank you, Johnny. \n[56]Sweetie, we need to go order our dinners. \n[57]I did not. \n[58]\"Save the dates\" were mailed weeks ago...You didn't get one? \n[59]Mail's a lot slower way out there in the country, huh? 65. \n[60]   \n[61]What'd we miss? \n[62]Who? Is? Hungry? \n[63]Run on, now, Yule May. Got a big crowd coming for Miss Leefolt's baby shower. \n[64]Okay... \n[65]Go on... \n[66]That's not working for free, Yule May. That's paying off a debt. \n[67]As a Christian, I'm going to do you a favor. 67. \n[68]God doesn't give charity to those who are well and able. You need to come up with this money on your own. You'll thank me one day. \n[69]Aibileen, are you enjoying your new bathroom over at Elizabeth's? 70. \n[70]Nice to have your own, isn't it? \n[71]Separate but equal. That's what Ross Barnett says, and you can't argue with the Governor. \n[72]Aibileen, did you know that me and Mister Holbrook arranged for that bathroom? Sent the boys over and the equipment, too. \n[73]Well...You. Are. Welcome. \n[74]What do you \"understand,\" Skeeter? \n[75]Is that true, Yule May? \n[76]Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if you could borrow money? \n[77]Skeeter, I'm starting to think you're intentionally not putting my initiative in the newsletter. 72. \n[78]Skeeter...I'm sorry about your mother. And I know you must be so worried. \n[79]But I'm worried about you. All this carrying on lately and now you're reading this stuff? \n[80]I mean, around your friends is one thing...But, believe it or not, there are real racists in this town! If the wrong person caught you with this...you'd be in serious trouble. \n[81]Get out of here! \n[82]Skeeter! She put it in the newsletter. I specifically said old coats are to be dropped at my house. Not commodes! \n[83]She put it in the newsletter when she knew we'd be down at the beach. \n[84]Go help those boys GET THOSE \n[85]You are sick. Do not speak to me. Do not look at me. Don't say hello to my children. How long had you been planning to humiliate my family? \n[86]You thought you were so clever, didn't ya? But I've already installed three of those old toilets in people's garages. \n[87]I intend to tell Stuart he's ruining his reputation by associating with you. Jolene's yard boy saw you hanging around the colored bus stop. \n[88]I guess your car was in the shop? \n[89]You know as well as I do, people won't buy so much as a slice of pound cake from an organization that harbors racial integrationists! \n[90]\"The Starving Children of Africa.\" \n[91]Just so you know, Lou Ann Templeton has taken your seat at bridge club. \n[92]Okay. First order of business. We're updating our newsletter. 87. \n[93]We're adding a fashion column with all the latest trends...Your dresses better be cute at next week's benefit! \n[94]Now it's time to choose a new editor for our new modern monthly. \n[95]Jolene, you're the sweetest thing! \n[96]Please! A nigra walks in a pawn shop with a ring of such size and clarity. It took'em all of five minutes to figure out where she worked. \n[97]I knew that girl was a thief the day she started. \n[98]Nobody wanted to hire a sass- mouthing, thieving nigra, did they? \n[99]Pie's as good as always, Minny. \n[100]If...I take you back, I'll have to cut your pay five dollars a week. \n[101]What do you put in here that makes it taste so good? \n[102]Momma can have a piece. \n[103]Cut her one. 99. \n[104]What did you say? \n[105]Have you lost your mind?! \n[106]Did what? \n[107]Thanks, Jolene... \n[108]Everybody enjoying their dinner? \n[109]  \n[110]A cause I'm sure is dear to their hearts as well. \n[111]Why, Johnny Foote. I'm surprised to see you here. Everybody knows you can't stand parties like this. \n[112]Where is that wife of yours? Out selling hotdogs? \n[113]Oh, you know I'm teasing you. We dated long enough where I can do that, can't I? \n[114]  \n[115]What? I didn't bid on anything. \n[116]Well, wasn't that sweet. Someone signed me up for that pie. \n[117]Let me go! \n[118]    \n[119]-You liar!

You're in big trouble, Missy. And you're going to jail. \n[138]I one-hundred-percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you. Those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble. \n[139]I don't, do I? You tell Aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh- huh. Remember her? Had you in her wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the L- shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's dining table. And that nigra, Minny?

A fork and two spoons. 135. \n[147]You know as well as I do that silver's not in the kitchen. \n[148]Do you hear her, Elizabeth? She's trying to blame it on a toddler. \n[149]Then it behooves me to inform you that you are fired, Aibileen. And I'll be calling the police. They know me. \n[150]Elizabeth can take care of her child. \n[151]I won't tolerate liars! 136. \n[152]I'm not talking about silver. I'm talking about those things you wrote about Elizabeth. Maybe I can't send you to jail for what you wrote, but I can send you to jail for being a thief. And your friend, Minny? That nigra's got a nice surprise coming to her.

I plan on splitting the pay with you, too. \n[31]Listen...all that talk in there today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm sorry you had to hear that. \n[32]Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio? \n[33]That reminds me so much of my maid growing up. \n[34]She loved me like you love Mae Mobley. \n[35]Aibileen? How could she just quit like that? \n[36]Yes. When I got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit. Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago. She didn't leave me a note or anything. \n[37]Could you do that to Mae Mobley? \n[38]Do you have an address for her or anything? \n[39]Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on Miss Myrna. \n[40]Hey, Jameso. \n[41]Momma! \n[42]Momma? \n[43]It's a little too everything. 22. \n[44]Much better. \n[45]Mom, I want to ask you about \n[46]What really happened? \n[47]How could she just take off without telling me? \n[48]Good for \"Fat Fanny Peatrow.\" 23. \n[49]A diploma. A pretty piece of paper. \n[50]They dropped out of college to become housewives, Mother. \n[51]Well, I did get a job today. \n[52]Writing...for The Jackson Journal. \n[53]Momma, would it really be so terrible if I never met a husband? \n[54]Oh my God! \n[55]Mother, I want to be with girls as much as you wanna be with Jameso. \n[56]It's a start, Carlton. \n[57]Oh! No, Pascagolua! You couldn't have known this...But, see, I'm allergic to almonds. \n[58]Last time I had an almond, I stopped liking men. \n[59]It's okay, Rebecca. They have a special root tea now. \n[60]Daddy, what happened to Constantine? \n[61]I don't believe you. \n[62]Mother, did you...fire her? \n[63]She raised me! \n[64]She worked here for twenty-nine years. \n[65]Good luck down there, Carlton. \n[66]I just couldn't tell her I didn't get asked to the dance. \n[67]I'm already taller than the boys' basketball coach. How tall are you, Constantine? \n[68]Momma was third runner up in the Miss South Carolina pageant. \n[69]What about you? What did you want to be, Constantine? \n[70]   \n[71]I was...well, I was raised by a colored woman. I've seen how simple it can be and...well, how complex it can be, too...between the families and the help. \n[72]I'd like to write something from the point of view of the help. These colored women raise white children, and then twenty years later those children become the employer. It's that irony, Miss Stein, that we love them and they love us yet...we don't even let them use the toilet in the house. \n[73]Margaret Mitchell glorified the mammy figure who dedicates her whole life to a white family but no one...ever asked Mammy how she felt about it. There is both undisguised hate for white women and an inexplicable love, but nobody ever talks about it down here. \n[74]Yes! \n[75]Go! Away! \n[76]So, yes, their side of the story. 30. \n[77]My mother. She just dropped by to- \n[78]I already have a maid. \n[79]Yes, ma'am... \n[80]You'd do that? \n[81]Oh, thank you, Miss Stein! \n[82]\"Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove the rings from my fat, slovenly husband's shirt collar when he is such a pig and sweats like one too...\" \n[83]Aibileen, do you ever wish you could...change things? \n[84]I mean, all that talk yesterday and now with what Hilly's up to. 32. \n[85]My momma fired Constantine. Thank you for telling me that. \n[86]Aibileen, I have an idea...Something I want to write about...But I need your help. \n[87]I want to interview you...about what it is like to work as a maid. \n[88]I'd like to do a book of interviews about working for white families. Show what it's like to work for, say...Elizabeth. \n[89]I was thinking we wouldn't tell her. The other maids will have to keep it secret, too. \n[90]I was hoping to get four or five. To really show what it's like in Jackson. To see what y'all get paid, the babies, the bathrooms, the good and the bad. \n[91]A book has never been written like this, Aibileen. \n[92]Fine. 34. \n[93]Afternoon, Aibileen. \n[94]Can I talk to you? \n[95]No. \n[96]Please. \n[97]Please let me interview you. I know it's scary, but I really believe this has to be done. We'll be careful. \n[98]I parked way up on State Street and caught a cab here like you asked. \n[99]Aibileen, I now know it's against the law for us to meet like this. \n[100]I've never seen you out of uniform before. You look nice, Aibileen. \n[101]I've never been in a colored person's home before. I think we're both doing great. This tea is really nice. \n[102]I...this isn't about my opinion. It doesn't matter how I feel. \n[103]Everybody? So, you know other maids who might be interested? \n[104]What about Minny? \n[105]What does it feel like, to raise a white child when your own child's at home, being...looked after by somebody else? \n[106]Is that your son? 42. \n[107]I'm so sorry. That's horrible. And, Aibileen, you don't have to call me \"ma'am.\" Not here anyway. \n[108]Do you want to talk about the bathroom? Or, about Elizab--Miss Leefolt? Anything about the way she pays you? Has she ever yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley? \n[109]No, I am. \n[110]Let's just do a couple of Miss Myrna letters, and I'll run on... \n[111]Well, sure I guess. \n[112]You don't say your prayers aloud? \n[113]I'm sure. \n[114]Oh, Aibileen. \n[115]This is great. You have no idea how much I appreciate this...But I just have to ask. What changed your mind? \n[116]I, ah...Well, I- \n[117]I'll have it in there soon. \n[118]Hilly? Do you need a ride? \n[119]I'm sorry about the newsletter. \n[120]With Momma being sick and- \n[121]Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice before. Maybe it's a sign. \n[122]You know I won't be his type. 46. \n[123]Bible study. \n[124]Momma, God doesn't care what day of the week it is. 52. \n[125]I want to show her perspective...so people might understand what it's like from your side. \n[126]I know, Minny. Maybe things might \n[127]Let's begin...begin with...with where you were born. 54. \n[128]So...you liked it? \n[129]Does this mean you'll publish it? \n[130]Twelve? \n[131]Then we might as well stop! 56. \n[132]We can't do that! \n[133]I mean...I would never do that. It wouldn't be real. It's wrong. \n[134]I'm sorry. Thank you both for trying. \n[135]I feel the hope in your fingers. \n[136]He's William's cousin. That's all I know. \n[137]What is that?! 59. \n[138]Two hours?! \n[139]Thanks, Constantine. Do you think this dress is cute? \n[140]I'm sorry. Thanks, Pascagoula. \n[141]  \n[142]Holy shit. \n[143]He's meeting me at Hilly's. Can I take the Cadillac? \n[144]I'll take the truck. \n[145]I'll drive slow. \n[146]Hey. \n[147]It was so goddamn awful. I hit a cat. \n[148]He looks handsome. \n[149]All right, give it to me. One to ten? \n[150]Really?! Seven? \n[151]Just water, please. \n[152]THANKS?! So...you went to Alabama? \n[153]Now you're in the oil business. Hilly says you're a rigsite leader. \n[154]That's not what I- \n[155]I write a...a domestic maintenance column for the Jackson Journal. \n[156]Well, you must be a genius. You figured out my whole scheme. \n[157]I'm sorry, but were you dropped on your head as an infant? \n[158]Not me! A kiss from God couldn't turn this `frog' into a `prince.' \n[159]You know she can hear you, Elizabeth? \n[160]Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of modern day government. \n[161]No, thanks... Yule May, I wanted to talk to you. \n[162]I understand. \n[163]Ah...Yule May was just telling me how excited she was that her boys were going to go to college. \n[164]Of course not, Hilly! \n[165]Not at all. I'm just so busy right now with Mom. \n[166]My dad had me get that for him. \n[167]Thanks, Hilly! And thanks for going through my things. \n[168]   \n[169]    \n[170]What?! \n[171]He's a drunken asshole, Mother. You wouldn't like him. \n[172]Ha! \n[173]Who sent you? William or Hilly? \n[174]Well, I haven't. So, just go. \n[175]Actually, I don't. I've never dated anyone before. \n[176]What? \n[177]I've got plenty to say... \n[178]I can't think of anything worse. \n[179]Just give me a minute! \n[180]Let me get my sweater. \n[181]I'll have a Co-cola. Lots of ice. \n[182]I want to be a journalist. Maybe a novelist. Maybe both. \n[183]Pretty? \n[184]That's not it, Hilly. \n[185]Technically, it was a typo, Hilly. \n[186]I wasn't hanging- 83. \n[187]Hilly, just who is that pound cake money being raised for, anyway? \n[188]    \n[189]What's wrong? \n[190]I'll ask daddy to get her a good lawyer. 91. \n[191]Thank you. I don't know what to- \n[192]Yes. Very nice. \n[193]You don't have to do this. \n[194]You don't know what they've said. \n[195]Well, happy birthday, Aibileen. You should have told me. \n[196]  \n[197]What?! \n[198]Oh my God! Oh my God! \n[199]Don't move a muscle! \n[200]Morning, Mom. \n[201]Sure! \n[202]Great! I'll get dressed. \n[203]Right after you went to bed. \n[204]I'm not really ready for that yet. \n[205]Oh my God! \n[206]My breath is horrible. \n[207]I love you, too. \n[208]You, too. \n[209]Are you okay? \n[210]Aibileen. We've changed all the names. \n[211]It's too dangerous, Minny. \n[212]But that's in a week, Miss Stein! 101. \n[213]Yes, Ma'am. \n[214]  \n[215]Stuart! How are you calling me? Aren't you on the rig? \n[216]Oh, Stuart. \n[217]I have to work. \n[218]I have a deadline, Sweetie. You should have asked me about this. \n[219]I'm sorry, Honey. I can't come. \n[220]I have one more story to type, but other than that, we are done. \n[221]Mine. \n[222]Mother, I need to talk to you about Constantine. \n[223]Well, I have to speak to her. \n[224]What...happened? 112. \n[225]How could you humiliate her like that?! \n[226]Why didn't you help her? \n[227]So you just threw her away? That woman did you the biggest favor of your life. She taught me kindness and self respect and you just threw her away like a broken appliance. 114. \n[228]`Cause she didn't have anything anymore. You broke her heart! \n[229]I needed somebody to look up to. \n[230]I have to go find her. She needs me. \n[231]And? \n[232]Why didn't y'all tell me all this? \n[233]When did she die? How long had she been in Chicago? 115. \n[234]I knew nothing about it. Miss Stein's P.R. Department called the station directly. 120. \n[235]Don't count on it. In her one year at Ole Miss she never cracked a book. \n[236]Me, too. \n[237]Stuart...I have to tell you something. \n[238]I'm serious...and...you have to promise not to tell anyone. \n[239]Yes. \n[240]But listen. Can I have your word? \n[241]I did both. 122. \n[242]What? \n[243]I'm not stirring up trouble, Stuart. Trouble's already here. \n[244]I had to tell you. You needed to know. \n[245]Just leave. \n[246]You okay? Can I get you anything? \n[247]Me, too. \n[248]Stuart proposed. \n[249]You knew? \n[250]Just say it. \n[251]Nothing! \n[252]Oh, Momma. \n[253]    \n[254]It's beautiful. 129. \n[255]I got a job offer from Harper and Row...in New York. \n[256]I not taking it. I just wanted to share it with you both. There's no one else I can tell. \n[257]I can't leave you two right when things are getting bad from a mess I created. I set out to write a book to make white people thankful. But in the end, what we should say is \"sorry.\" \n[258]What are you doing here? \n[259]You can't prove anything, Hilly. \n[260]Exactly who are you talking about? You don't know anything. 131. \n[261]Careful, Hilly. Don't give yourself away now. \n[262]I did not invite you here! \n[263]You're telling my mother on me? \n[264]You get out of here! \n[265]Yes, Ma'am. \n[266]Ma'am? \n[267]No, Ma'am. 133. \n[268]What? \n[269]How do you know about New York? \n[270]   ", "Phelan": "\n[1]  \n[2]  \n[3]  \n[4]  \n[5]  \n[6]  \n[7]  \n[8]    \n[9]   \n[10]  \n[11]Skeeter nods rapidly as if she knows what \"kvetch\" means. \n[12]  \n[13]  \n[14]  \n[15]   \n[16]  \n[17]  \n[18]  \n[19]  \n[20]    \n[21]  \n[22]  \n[23]  \n[24]  \n[25]  \n[26]  \n[27]   \n[28]    \n[29]  \n[30]    \n[31]  \n[32]  ", "Celia": "\n[1]Ah-hem. Hello, is Elizabeth in? \n[2]Please tell her Celia Foote called again. I'll call back tomorrow. \n[3]Ah-hem. Miss? \n[4]I'm looking for some help at my house. You know any maids looking? \n[5]Okay. Celia Foote. Emerson 6-8-4. Bye, now. \n[6]Johnny, you scared the daylights out of me! \n[7]You're home early. \n[8]Johnny, I can't get any of your old friends from school to call me back. \n[9]Johnny, honestly! \n[10]I don't know what's taking us so long. I'm sorry. \n[11]Watch my hair. \n[12]Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote. Aibileen said you'd be on time. \n[13]Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola? \n[14]One of those upsidedown cakes from the magazine. It ain't workin' out too good. Come on in. \n[15]I guess I have some learnin' to do. \n[16]Johnny's momma wouldn't let me decorate a thing. If I had my way, this house would have wall to wall white carpet with gold trim and none of this old stuff. \n[17]Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis. \n[18]Let's go meet Oscar! \n[19]Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in Montana back in 1910 with Teddy Roosevelt. \n[20]We got five bedrooms and bathrooms here in the main house. The pool house has two more beds and baths. 49. \n[21]I'm pregnant now. \n[22]I know it's an awful lot to do. Five other maids have already turned me down...Can I at least give you some bus money? \n[23]What? So...You'll do it?! \n[24]I'm sorry. This is my first time hiring a maid. \n[25]You can't come at all on weekends. \n[26]After eight, and you have to leave at four. \n[27]Johnny doesn't know I'm bringing in help. \n[28]It's not that I'd be fibbing. I just want him to think I can do this on my own...I need some help `til I get the hang of it. I need a maid. \n[29]Oww! Dawgonit! \n[30]I can cook corn pone, boil potatoes, and do grits. \n[31]We didn't have electric current where I was raised. \n[32]How pretty. Looks like frosting. \n[33]This is fun! \n[34]Looks so good! I'm starved. \n[35]I'm fine right here, Minny. \n[36]I'm real grateful you're here. \n[37]Oh, no! Hide! \n[38]Oh...It's just the florist. Johnny must have sent me flowers. \n[39]You're right. Maybe we ought to burn the chicken a little. \n[40]Hilly, did you ever get the messages that I've been calling you? \n[41]Well, I would love to help with the benefit. I have a lovely hand if you need invitations addressed. \n[42]  \n[43]I'm fine. Minny. Go on home for the day. \n[44]I said go home, Minny! \n[45]There's so much blood. Why is there so much blood this time? \n[46]Please, Minny. Will you get it out? I can't look at it again. \n[47]The two rosebushes stand in the middle of the front lawn. A DOCTOR enters the room. \n[48]We got married because I was pregnant. But it slipped out too. 85. \n[49]Johnny wants kids now. I thought if I was real still, brought somebody in to do the house and cooking, maybe I'd hold on to this one. Oh, Minny, what's he gonna do with me? \n[50]He doesn't know about this one, or the one before... \n[51]Minny, you know how to play bridge, don't you? \n[52]Elizabeth, it's me, Celia Foote. I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd drop by. \n[53]I...brought you a chocolate pie...My maid, Minny, made it. \n[54]They made me stand there like the vacuum man. Why, Minny? \n[55]So, Hilly probably thinks I was fooling around with Johnny while they were still going steady. 89. \n[56]No wonder! They don't hate me...They hate what they think I did! \n[57]Well, I'm just going to have to let Hilly know I'm not a boyfriend stealer. In fact, I'll tell her Friday night at the benefit. \n[58]That looks bad. \n[59]I know you didn't fall in the tub, Minny. Let me take a look. \n[60]Johnny, you are bad! Bad! Bad! \n[61]Do you think I might have overdressed a little? It's supposed to be formal, but this looks like a funeral. \n[62]Well, hello, Elizabeth. 103. \n[63]Those are lovely dresses. \n[64]Really?! I was worried I was a tad overdressed. \n[65]Woo-hoo! \n[66]And have my stomach poke out?! \n[67]Congratulations, Hilly! I didn't know you're a fan of Minny's pies. \n[68]I've wanted to talk to you all night. Minny told me why you won't be my friend. You think me and Johnny went behind your back. \n[69]I'm so sorry. \n[70]I don't know what you- \n[71]Hilly, I got pregnant after you and Johnny broke up! \n[72]Johnny never cheated on you...At least, not with me. \n[73]And I'm sorry I thought you'd be tickled to win that pie. \n[74]Uh-oh. 107. \n[75]The way Hilly looked at me. Like I was trash on the road. \n[76]She billed me for her dress. In lieu of payment, she's asked that I send two-hundred dollars to the African Children's Fund and then she banned me from all future League events. \n[77]I'm not right for this kind of life, Minny. I don't need a dinner table for twelve people. 109. \n[78]I couldn't get two people over here if I begged. She called me a liar and accused me of getting her that pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if it wasn't for that! I can't do this anymore to Johnny. I'm going back to Sugar Ditch. \n[79]Thank you. For telling me that. \n[80]I cooked it all by myself. I wanted to do something special. I wanted to say \"thank you.\" \n[81]Are you happy, Minny? \n[82]Are you? \n[83]You know, if I were you, I'd give it right back to him.

I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on any date. I wasn't even close to ready. \n[21]I was engaged last year. She ended it. 75. \n[22]We'd been dating since we were fifteen. You know how it is. \n[23]Well! That must be it then. \n[24]I've never met a woman that said exactly what she was thinking. \n[25]Would you like to...come downtown with me and have dinner? We could talk... We could listen to each other this time. \n[26]Then, I'm sorry. That's what I came to say and...I said it. \n[27]What do you want, Skeeter? 76. \n[28]No, I mean in life. What do you want? \n[29]I like that...I've been thinking about you. You're smart, you're pretty, you're...tall! \n[30]Yes. And I read your column. Very informative. I never knew Crisco got rid of diaper rash. \n[31]I hope you get to write something really good, Skeeter. Something you believe in. \n[32] Chirp. Chirp. \n[33]So is mine. 96. \n[34]I love you. \n[35]Honey, I'm sorry, but I have to get down to the coast. \n[36]I'll be back in time for the benefit. Love you. \n[37]  \n[38]Oh, God. \n[39]Hey, Honey. \n[40]What if I told you I have twenty- four hours in New Orleans? 110. \n[41]That I'm in the Presidential Suite of the Roosevelt Hotel...That we have dinner reservations in the Blue Room tonight and lunch tomorrow at Galatoires. \n[42]Did you hear me? I spoke to your dad, and he's gonna have Jameso drive you down right now. \n[43]What? \n[44]Work in the car. Jesus, Skeeter, it's a cleaning column. \n[45]I'm trying to be romantic... \n[46]That month felt like a year. I missed you so much. \n[47]Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going back on the rig. \n[48]How about \"yes?!\" I had this with me down in New Orleans, you know. \n[49]Hang on. Did you say `yes'? \n[50]Sure. You have my word. \n[51]This is what you've been writing for the last twelve months?! What happened to the cleaning column? \n[52]So, the talk in town? I said they were dead wrong. Told them you were too smart to get mixed up in anything like that. \n[53]That joke you played on Hilly with the toilets. Hell, that's funny. But this? I don't understand why you did this...why you even care. \n[54]Things are fine around here. Why stir up trouble? \n[55]I guess it is. \n[56]I guess I don't really know you, Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody I don't know. \n[57]That was my grandmother's. \n[58]Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. ", "Whitworth": "", "Charlotte": "\n[1]Is this a little too young? \n[2]Your daddy bought me this dress in `58. \n[3]-Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl. \n[4]Come on, you try it on. \n[5]I told you...she went to live with her people in Chicago...Now, Skeeter, your mother is dying, and she wants to see you in this dress. \n[6]I told her not to write you. I didn't want you upset in the middle of final exams. Honey, we were just a job to her. With them it's all about money...Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After she got that teller job, her mother said she was just swimming in proposals. \n[7]This looks precious on you! Four years ago my daughter went off to college, and what did she come home with? \n[8]A diploma. A pretty piece of paper. \n[9]Hilly and Elizabeth have such lovely children. \n[10]If only you'd show a little gumption, Eugenia... \n[11]You did? \n[12]Great. You can write my obituary. \"Charlotte Phelan dead. Her daughter still single.\" \n[13]I need to...ask you something, Skeeter. I read the other day about how some girls...get unbalanced, start thinking these...well, unnatural thoughts. \n[14]Are you...do you...find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about... \n[15]Girls or...or women? 24. \n[16]Because, this article says there's a cure, a special root tea. \n[17]Eugenia! \n[18]   \n[19]Oh, the irony of it all. Givin' advice on how to keep up a home when she... \n[20]You have pushed it, Young Lady! \n[21]You wouldn't understand. Not until you've hired help of your own. 26. \n[22] \n[23]It was a colored thing, and I've put it behind me. \n[24]Excuse me, Rebecca. My daughter has upset my cancerous ulcers. \n[25]Eugenia! You've grown another inch since breakfast. Go put on a dress that fits before that boy and his daddy come pick you up. 27. \n[26]Pray Carlton doesn't like LSU, Constantine. It's so far. It might be the last we see of him. \n[27]Skeeter, who are you talking to in there? \n[28]Where are you going, Skeeter? \n[29]On a Saturday night? \n[30]This is bound to work, Sweetie. It even smells expensive. \n[31]How can you not know his last name? \n[32]That's just so sweet of Hilly. \n[33]The Shinolator! It cost eleven dollars. I'm a good mother. \n[34]\"The Miracle Straitening Cap\" must remain on the head for two hours.\" \n[35]I'll have Pascagoula bring you a magazine. \n[36]You've shrunk five inches. You'll be able to wear heels tonight. 60. \n[37]You're not leaving this house in those awful, Mexican, man shoes. \n[38]What time is he picking you up? \n[39]We promised Carlton the Cadillac tonight. So, William's cousin will just have to come get you himself. \n[40]It's hooked to the motor grader. \n[41]Don't mope. Remember to smile! \n[42]And, don't sit like some squaw Indian. Cross! Your! Ankles! \n[43]   \n[44]Skeeter! \n[45]Don't panic, but there's a very tall man named Stuart here for you. \n[46]Skeeter, love and hate are two horns on the same goat. And, you need a goat! \n[47]Stuart, would you like a cocktail? \n[48]What's your last name, Stuart? \n[49]Hmm...Where are you from? \n[50]Really? Well, I know a Whitworth from Natchez...But he's a Senator up in Washington. 74. \n[51]Who is? \n[52]Really? \n[53]Well...tell him I said \"Hello\"...I'm going to go see if Pascagoula needs some help in the kitchen. \n[54]Honey, would you like me to drop you off at bridge club on the way to my doctor's appointment? \n[55]Eugenia?! \n[56]Morning, Sleepy Head. 95. \n[57]I thought you could take me to the doctor this morning and then we could get some lunch afterwards. \n[58] Or...we could...go straight to Fanny Mae's for a girl day. \n[59]When did Stuart leave last night? \n[60]Well, I hope he knows he's welcome to stay in Carlton's old room. \n[61]\"Bird in the hand,\" Eugenia. Bird. In. The. Hand... \n[62]Have you been crying? You know that ages your skin, Dear. \n[63]Oh, Eugenia. That was so long ago. \n[64]Now, you look. I was good to Constantine. Oh, she talked back plenty of times, and I put up with it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give me a choice... \n[65]I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon. Constantine was to do the floors that morning so they'd be dry in time. \n[66]Well, the floors were soaking wet when the first guest arrived. \n[67]Then, she burned the coffee. She had gotten so old, Skeeter. \n[68]Her mishaps were becoming a daily occurrence, and I had had it. \n[69]Get a hold of yourself, Constantine! 113. \n[70]And that's when it happened. \n[71]I told her she couldn't work here anymore and to go on home. \n[72]I didn't mean to. \n[73]I was upset. I didn't know what else to do. \n[74]I didn't throw her away, Skeeter. Your daddy went to her house the very next day to give her her job back. But she had already moved to Chicago. Left everything behind. \n[75]Please don't do this to me, Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you have to remember, they're not like us. They are different. \n[76]And you idolized her too much! You always have! \n[77]We finally found the address of her daughter in Chicago...so we sent Carlton up there to go get Constantine. \n[78]When he got there...she was dead, Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey. \n[79]I knew you'd blame me...when it wasn't my fault. It just happened, and it was so unfortunate. I'm sorry, Eugenia. \n[80]Two weeks. \n[81]Skeeter?! Come in here, please. \n[82]Come here, Eugenia. I want to tell you something. \n[83]You go first. \n[84]Finally! \n[85]Of course. He had to ask Daddy for your hand. \n[86]What did you do?! \n[87]Young lady, I'm talking to you! \n[88]Stuart'll come around. It's a funny dance.  Took this one a year. Anyway, my news. After a long talk with your daddy, I've made a decision. My health's been on the uptick these past few weeks. And I know the doctor says it's some kind of last \n[89]But, as I said, I made a decision. I have decided not to die. \n[90]Too late. I tried calling Fanny Mae's so I could make your hair appointments for the next twenty years, but they wouldn't allow it. \n[91]I certainly can't leave you now. \n[92]Why, Hilly...It's been such a long time, Dear. Everything okay, you two? \n[93]Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill? \n[94]Darling, no husband wants to come home and see this. \n[95]And that...that is horrendous. \n[96]You know, Hilly. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too many...SWEETS? \n[97]In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get one of those on our lip. \n[98]Eugenia? \n[99]Come in here, please. \n[100]Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible study? Anything like that? \n[101]Good. We're going shopping. \n[102]`Cause no single daughter of mine is going to New York, representing the great state of Mississippi, without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe. \n[103]I'm very proud of you, Eugenia. \n[104]A friend of Constantine's told me. \n[105]Would you do me the honor of signing my copy?
