Not Asian. Alright. Kill Red. \n[5] TED  puts his portable phone back in its charger.  \n[6]Fuck. \n[7]Carol, there's another name to run. Dale Denton. \n[8]If the Asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home, we can't be too cautious. The boys say Denton and Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their assassin failed, they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job. Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned \"going to the casino.\" \n[9] Inside an Escalade with tinted   windows sit two frightening looking Asian men.   They have earphones on and an eavesdropping tool aimed at   Ted's house. They hear every word. One of them writes   down info in Korean.     \n[10] Ted and Carol are in mid-discussion, and rather distraught at that. Behind them two henchmen take the dead Asian man's body out the back door.  \n[11]A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house. And the blood was fresh. \n[12]Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us. What the fuck is going on! Any luck with the cell phones? \n[13]I want to talk to the Asians. Get me Cheung's number. Now. \n[14]Cheung. It's Ted. \n[15]Cheung, I want you to call off your man Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout, assassin, and frankly I don't care. I just want him gone. I want him dead. If you do this, I'll consider it a peace offering, otherwise, you're asking for war. And just in case you forgot, I'm number one, and there's a reason for that. You've got 24 hours to reply. \n[16] Carol, who is a little bruised up from the car crash, sits with Ted. They are both furious.  \n[17]This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit. \n[18]You have them? \n[19]He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank. \n[20]Well, we'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know. What about the shipment? Ready to move out? \n[21]Has anyone seen my bigger knife? Do you guys hear that? \n[22]\n[23]Denton!!! \n[24]Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch? \n[25]I don't know who you are, Denton, or why you're trying to ruin my life, but you're fuckin' dead! \n[26]", "Jones": "", "Budlofsky": "\n[1]Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I think he knew we were coming. \n[2]Why isn't he coming now? What did you say? \n[3]Than you thought. I thought it would be more than you did. I'll call Ted. \n[4]They're long gone. \n[5]Fuck! What the hell? \n[6]What the fuck is going on? \n[7]No. One sec. \n[8]Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't helping. \n[9]Yeah! \n[10]Get up. \n[11]Don't. Ted wants him. \n[12]Haven't you seen \"Speed\"? \"Shoot the hostage\". \n[13]Still worked. \n[14]Throw him in with the other guy, and everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch outside. This is fucked up. Somethings going down. \n[15]What? \n[16]You're kidding me, right? Die Hard? \n[17]Got them downstairs. \n[18]We found Saul at his grandmother's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman, armed to the teeth, and- \n[19]Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I disarmed him. We got `em both holed up downstairs. \n[20]We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so. \n[21]Arg... \n[22] ", "Angie": "\n[1]Dale! \n[2]Mmm. Minty. \n[3]Yo Dale. `sup. \n[4]Of course. But can we just head to my locker first? I left some stuff by mistake. \n[5]So, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think I made you up. \n[6]You don't have to feel weird about it. They know how old you are and they're fine with it. They just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that I'm not dating you just because you're older. \n[7]Fuck. Well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them. \n[8]Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend. \n[9]I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco. \n[10]So, do you want to get some food? \n[11]Now? \n[12]We'll see if Neo is truly the one. \n[13] Dale and Saul get out of the cab in a pleasant neighborhood. Saul begrudgingly pays the driver. They walk towards Angie's house.  \n[14] Dale dashes in.  \n[15] \n[16]It's Dale! You came. \n[17]Dale?   What happened to you? \n[18]You were in the woods? \n[19]Is this a joke? \n[20] Saul sees a car nearing. He sees Budlofsky and Matheson are in it.  \n[21] Angie and her parents try to make sense of what Dale is saying.  \n[22]Who are these people? Why are they- \n[23] \n[24]Let's go to the police! \n[25]\n[26] \n[27]Saul? Dale, who is- \n[28] Budlofsky and Matheson are walking towards the front door when they hear the gunshot and dive behind some bushes.  \n[29] Everyone is in shock. Saul frantically pats himself down to see if he got hit.  \n[30]Dad, put the gun down! \n[31] Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in. Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge.     \n[32] BAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson bends down and picks up a bloody fork.  \n[33]Dale - get in the car! \n[34]Shut up dad! \n[35]What are you going to do? What should we do? \n[36]Carlyle? I...I have so many questions. I just...how can this be happening? Where...where are you going? \n[37]Uh...thanks. \n[38]Dale? \n[39]I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay? \n[40]Dale. I've realized some problems and- \n[41]Dale, shut up and listen. People are trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug dealers are trying to kill me, because of you! It's fucking over, man. Are you kidding me? For gods sake... \n[42]\n[43]You're not how you think you are Dale, and it's pathetic. Call me when I can go home. ", "Anderson": "", "Shannon": "\n[1]Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and have some couscous. Can I get you a drink? \n[2] \n[3]I think it is a joke. \n[4]Robert! No! \n[5]What did you do, Angie?! \n[6]Robert, what's going on? \n[7]Oh my god. \n[8]Is this...for real- ", "Clark": "", "Saul": "\n[1] \n[2] SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. A large \"Scarface\" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a knock at the door and Dale enters.  \n[3] \n[4]I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here? \n[5]That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck. \n[6]Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs. \n[7]Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit. \n[8]Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth. \n[9]Smell it. \n[10]It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter. \n[11]No doubt. Just let me grab my scale. \n[12]What's with the look? What? \n[13]Oh shit! The scale. Be right back. \n[14]   \n[15] \n[16]You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a \"trifecta\" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint. \n[17]Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me? \n[18]I can't even light it on my own. \n[19]Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready? \n[20]It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher. \n[21]And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean? \n[22]It's crazy. The better the weed, the more I wish I could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit I can think of in total, you know? \n[23]Okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and I really gotta ask. What's with the suit? \n[24]You`re a servant? Like, a butler. \n[25]Nice, man. Where'd you get that job? \n[26]Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries? \n[27]Does she smoke pot? \n[28]That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his biography. \n[29] \n[30]Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it pretty good. I wish I had a job that easy. Fuck. \n[31]Hey! You're right, man. I never thought of it like that. \n[32]That's totally true. Except tomorrow. Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't figure it out. \n[33]Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after? \n[34]Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him! \n[35]Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the \"Jesus of Weed\". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface. \n[36]No worries dude, peace. \n[37] Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell, laughing so hard that he's crying.  \n[38]Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech. \n[39] \n[40]Hello? \n[41] \n[42] \n[43] \n[44]Be quiet, man, I got neighbors- \n[45] \n[46]Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy? \n[47]A cop killed a guy? \n[48]Was the guy Ted? \n[49]I don't know, the old guy who shot the guy? \n[50]I heard Ted's got grey hair! \n[51]What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did you come here? Did they follow you?!? \n[52]Did they follow you here!?! \n[53]But they don't know it's you? \n[54]So...they're not coming here? \n[55]Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit. \n[56]Did you see any blood? Was it sick? \n[57]I wonder who the guy he shot was? \n[58]Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit. They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two in town. Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo, you want some of this? \n[59]So, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings? \n[60]Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb. \n[61]What? \n[62] \n[63]Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was giving me an \"exclusive sneak preview\". \n[64]Yeah. So, we're the only guys. \n[65]I could. Why? \n[66]No...seriously, why? \n[67]So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town. \n[68]Mother of fuck! \n[69]Let's go! \n[70]Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here! \n[71]Yes! Come on! \n[72] Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button, terrified for their lives.  \n[73]Fuck! I forgot something! \n[74]Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head- \n[75]Why?!? \n[76] \n[77]Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!  The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close.  \n[78]What the fuck was that? \n[79] The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.  \n[80]What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew. \n[81]Let's go to your place. \n[82]Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn. \n[83]All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me. \n[84]Well, how much money do you have? \n[85]Well, shut up then! I've got more than you! \n[86]I wish we could just go nowhere. \n[87] \n[88]There's no way. He could only find out from Red. \n[89]Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her. \n[90]Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now! \n[91]So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you don't trust me then? \n[92]Thank you! \n[93]Yo, Red. You okay man? \n[94]Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor. \n[95]You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me. \n[96]So, can I come on over now? \n[97](covering phone, talks to \n[98]Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day. \n[99] \n[100]Yeah, right after I see my grandma. \n[101]Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon. \n[102]We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime. \n[103]Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house. \n[104]I always liked smoking weed in the forest. \n[105]Dale...wait! \n[106]Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know how this shit works, but...can cops... you said they might be cops...could they triangulate our phones or trace `em or some shit like that? I don't know. I feel like I've seen that. \n[107]I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace them when we're not even on them! \n[108]It's them!!! \n[109]Holy fuck. That was close. \n[110]No! Smash it! \n[111]Shit! \n[112]Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that tree! \n[113]That one. \n[114]It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free with the plan. It must've smashed when it landed. \n[115]I was trying to smash it! How often does a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck. \n[116]Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could call it! \n[117]Man, it's not like they got McGuyver workin' on the case. I bet they can't even triangulate it. \n[118]Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'. \n[119]Dude, this is the scariest place I've ever been in my life. \n[120]You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed? \n[121]No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch. \n[122] \n[123] \n[124] \n[125]  \n[126] Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.  \n[127] \n[128] Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS into the ground.     \n[129] \n[130]Let's go! Go! \n[131]I don't know! \n[132]I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go! \n[133]But there could be something out there! \n[134]Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm staying in the car. \n[135]Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why don't we just shoot ourselves in the nuts? \n[136]Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint before I go to sleep, and don't worry about it, even though you're being a dick, it's on the house. \n[137]Thanks to me! \n[138]Fuck me. \n[139] \n[140]It's... \n[141]This can't be right. \n[142]It says, uh... \n[143]It couldn't be three in the morning, could it? \n[144]  \n[145]-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And we've gotta call Red. \n[146]We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number was in my phone! \n[147]Yes, I remember. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm forgetful? That's right, I know the word insinuating. \n[148]Are you fucking serious? \n[149]It's dead? \n[150]What the fuck happened? How did this happen? \n[151]Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep. \n[152]For real? \n[153]It's like, my thumb is my cock! \n[154] \n[155]I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe. \n[156]I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. That's actually pretty late. \n[157]Red! It's Saul. Open up. \n[158] \n[159]We were in the forest laying low. Thinking. \n[160]Whoa! Dude, have you been crying? \n[161]A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes? \n[162]Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how many joints we've shared? I told you, man. This is from that time you ate the lollypop straight from the strippers sna- \n[163] \n[164]Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for protest lawyers, and-  \n[165]Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his house.  \n[166]Don't be weird about this. If he wants trouble, it's his right to have it.  \n[167]Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine. We had a crazy night in the woods, which I assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant bong to get super-duper high. \n[168]Dale!   What the fuck are you doing? \n[169]Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy! I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought this guy over here, he's a total lunatic. \n[170]Holy cock! \n[171]Dude! He's sorry! Wait! \n[172]\n[173]Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked off that shit again!?! Ow! \n[174]\n[175]Why, man!?! Why! \n[176]What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?! \n[177]You didn't stub your toe, did you? \n[178]\n[179]Red, you motherfucker. \n[180]We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone! \n[181]He knows my name too! \n[182]We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that. \n[183]Maybe we could talk him into killing himself, or, like, make him promise not to tell. \n[184]Don't look at me, you sellout bastard. Now start talking! \n[185]What do we do? He's not gonna talk. \n[186]For real? \n[187]You were Red. Now you're no one to me. \n[188]You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard, man. Like, fucking hit him! \n[189]Seriously? \n[190]What else? \n[191]I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is. \n[192]Come on, let's tape this piece of shit up. \n[193]I can't find the edge. \n[194]I can't find the, oh...wait... \n[195] \n[196] \n[197]Thanks, Red. \n[198]In here! \n[199]We should hide! \n[200]I think we should stay! \n[201]Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine! \n[202] \n[203]My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go after her, would they? She's got a different last name. Belogus. \n[204]Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you! \n[205]Fine. But hurry. \n[206]No fucking way. \n[207] \n[208]\n[209]No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S- \n[210]Ow!! Fuck. Now I'm gonna need a tetanus shot! They fuckin' kill. Fuck! \n[211]Dale, they're coming! \n[212]Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! \n[213]Stop shooting, man! I'm Dale's dealer \n[214] \n[215]Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed potatoes in my wound. \n[216]Why aren't we in that car? \n[217]Huff   Huff  Where are we running? \n[218]Victory joint complete. Here ya go. \n[219]Like, really balls. \n[220]Or Scarface! \n[221]And you probably saved Angie, which is fucking pimp. \n[222]We're in this together, right? So, ya know. \n[223] \n[224] \n[225]We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket. \n[226]Oh man. It's still fucking killing me. \n[227]Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way. \n[228]Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere. I mean, we got it from guys like us. \n[229]Well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed- \n[230] \n[231]It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though. \n[232]Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some weed, or, like, what? \n[233]See, that's the problem around here. Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. You gotta wow `em. Hey! Who wants some weed!?! \n[234]Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic? \n[235]You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife!  \n[236]And we're all high, that's hilarious. \n[237]Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to teach you some business. Brass tacs - this is the best weed you've ever smoked, agreed? \n[238]So I'm gonna make this simple. How much did you get between you? \n[239]Alright. You gimme all your money, you can each take two handfuls of weed. That treat ya right? \n[240]I know. Keep it on the down low. \n[241]And we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free. \n[242]But at least now we can afford to run. I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. Let's have us a little mardi-gras fiesta. \n[243]They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck... \n[244]The lady cop. She's gonna kill him. \n[245]Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash! \n[246] \n[247](motion at the Police \n[248]\n[249] The car weaves through traffic.  \n[250]The slurpee! I can't see! \n[251]Dude, I seriously can't see! \n[252]I don't know. Okay. \n[253]Oh fuck! Shit! \n[254]Ah! Ah! My leg! \n[255]Her car's better! \n[256]Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole! \n[257]Hold on. I've got an idea. \n[258]Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd keep going. \n[259]\n[260]Run! \n[261]So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot... \n[262]Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast. Bend over. \n[263]I am! \n[264]The brown ones nice, but the metallic ones seems more... \n[265]A thank you would be nice! \n[266]Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry again about the clocks. Ha! What a douche bag. Yeah, love you too. \n[267]Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta go see my grandma, okay? She was worried `cause I didn't show up to help with the locks. But before that I've got to smoke another bowl. \n[268]Why not? \n[269]No. It happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. Which is weird, `cause they really seemed like cool kids. \n[270]When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned. What do you gotta say to that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! The Beatles were high! \n[271]For one thing, I'm done dealing pot. Mostly, because I don't know where I would get it now, but still. And \"b\", fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. You're the one who dropped the roach! \n[272]Stop calling it marijuana! \n[273]See! This is why you're a douche bag, Denton. Because you think you're better than others, but you're just a dumb pothead burnout, same as me. \n[274]But you said you bought when you already had a few times, just to hang out? \n[275]Here. Buy yourself a good last meal. \n[276]Super size it, bitch. \n[277]Hey! Mrs. Mendelson! \n[278]\n[279]Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me! \n[280] \n[281]\n[282] \n[283]Oh fuck. That looks painful. \n[284]\n[285] \n[286]Dude, look at all this weed. \n[287]What the hell is that? \n[288]Ow. \n[289]Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me out, you shitty bastard? That what happened? \n[290]To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're caught, too. And now I have to die with some asshole. \n[291]Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me and I'll consider forgiving you for this mad shit. \n[292]Oh really? What, you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick? We're not gonna escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell! \n[293] \n[294] \n[295]Holy shit, man! I'm sorry! \n[296]Dale? You're alive! \n[297]They got your ear. \n[298]Here. Get up. \n[299] \n[300]Look at all this fucking weed, man. Where the hell are we? Is this some underground weed city we don't know about? \n[301] \n[302] \n[303] \n[304]You could boost me up! We'll sneak out. \n[305]Really? \n[306]\n[307]About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already. \n[308]What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you? \n[309]Whoa. That was awesome. \n[310]You're a good man, Dale Denton. \n[311]Wha- \n[312]\n[313]Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy. \n[314]Fuck... \n[315]Fuck tha po-lice. \n[316]\n[317]Crazy  huff   huff , psycho bitch... \n[318]R...Red? \n[319]\n[320]Oh no... \n[321] \n[322]No fucking way. Seriously? How did that happen? \n[323]They were fighting Asian dudes, man. \n[324]So we're, like, in a drug war. That's cool. \n[325]Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the hell was I going to leave you there after you came to save me? Fuck that. \n[326]What should we do now? Can we go home?  \n[327]Tell her you cut off your ear for her, like that crazy artist. But, seriously dude, your joking right? She'll never take you back, ever. Just grow up and date a woman your own age.  \n[328]Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.  \n[329]Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? And, like, I never said anything, but you do have the voice. Like, when I didn't know what you did, I kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that Shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit.  \n[330]Work at a bong shop. \n[331]Do you hear something? \n[332]Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I don't know...like, there might be someone out there. I mean...how do we know we got them all? \n[333] \n[334] \n[335] \n[336] \n[337]Wait! Me too! ", "Silver": "", "Red": "\n[1] \n[2]Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe. \n[3]Sure man, anything. I'm Red. \n[4]Sure man, no problem. Red swears it, hombre. \n[5] \n[6]Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow! Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is that the one on Granville and 41st. \n[7]Well, cool brother. Noon it is. \n[8]For sure. We should definitely hit up the casino. \n[9] RED, 30, stalky and short, sits between the BUDLOFSKY and \n[10] \n[11]No, man! \n[12] Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.  \n[13] \n[14] \n[15]Dale who? \n[16] \n[17]What? Oh, I uh... ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one before. I started crying. \n[18]...uh, yeah, man. \n[19]Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all about? That's what I want to know.  \n[20]Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I deserve to know.  \n[21]Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.  \n[22]No one. Nada.     \n[23]Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at home. I'm just going to use the ol' telephone-o. \n[24]What the fuck! \n[25]Fuck you man - this is my house! \n[26] Disoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red can be heard fighting outside.  \n[27]I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please don't fight! \n[28] Red is BEATING the shit out of Saul.     \n[29]\n[30] Frantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul sprint down the hall.  Just as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone flies into the bathtub.  \n[31]I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!! \n[32]They're gonna come back and kill me!!! \n[33] Saul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He looks back to see Saul getting pummelled.  \n[34] \n[35]I can't...I don't know anything. \n[36]Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red! \n[37]Please don't. \n[38]That didn't hurt. \n[39]Wait! I...I... \n[40]No! \n[41]Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it. Listen...two...two guys came here, they...they were here when you called- \n[42]They work for Ted. Budlofsky and Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They were here all day, but you guys didn't show. They said they'd kill me if I didn't bring you to them, they said I'd- \n[43]I know there's this lady cop. He could have more, I don't know. He's got pretty crazy connections. He's also got a cool- ass hideout. It's crazy man. \n[44]Listen, I- \n[45]The Asians! \n[46]The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians. \n[47]I swear to god that's all I know...I swear... \n[48] \n[49] \n[50]I know these guys, it's cool. Just head out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell `em nothing. You can count on me! \n[51]Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude named Dale Denton! They just ran out the back! \n[52] Budlofsky dashes back into the apartment.     \n[53]I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale Denton's the other guys name. He was with Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do you want? \n[54]What? Um...white, they're both white. I think Denton might be a Jew, but I couldn't really tell. \n[55] \n[56]    \n[57]OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow! \n[58] BAM! Dale kicks open Red's door and dashes into Red's, ready for anything.  \n[59] Dale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor, clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom box.  \n[60] \n[61]Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya once, tool ya again! \n[62]Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired. \n[63]I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right here- \n[64]I'm having a little going away party and I don't remember inviting you, cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to leave. In my dying moments, I don't want some asshole I barely know around. \n[65]Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm gonna end up in But that doesn't matter `cause once Ted finds out, which he will, I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked through and through. Now if you'd be willing to give a dying man his wish, could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs \"All Eyez On Me\". I want to listen to it while I die. \n[66]Will you stop saying that, I've excepted it, man. I'm at peace.  cough \n[67]Fuckin eh, amigo. \n[68]Blaze of glory, motherfucker. \n[69] Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards from the barn.     \n[70]This is awesome! We're so gonna show those motherfuckers. Think they can kill me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll. \n[71]So, this is the backside of the farm. If you stay low in the grass you should be fine. If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes you harder to hit. \n[72]Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, I should get to the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs, right? I got shot in the best spot possible. I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. Full of possibilities. Go get `em, slugger. \n[73]I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. Good luck, amigo! \n[74] \n[75]Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy are rescuing you. And getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut. \n[76] Saul spins around to see Carol standing behind him, a machine gun aimed.  \n[77]Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on fire? Kill my Fiesta? Fuckers. \n[78]Fuck yeah, I'm fine. I'm Red. You're makin' me feel like a broken record. Now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole. \n[79]Oh my god, they blew your ear off, man! Fuck that's gross. Can you dudes switch sides? I don't want to look at it.  \n[80]You do have a good talk radio voice. I love that shit, too. I...wait, say something again?     \n[81]You're that dude whose always calling KSTAR about havin' two garbage days. I totally agree with you, man. I work out of my house, and it's, like, one of my main concerns, garbage pile up. \n[82]I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys. \n[83]What the fuck are you guys talkin' about?

He smokes a joint while listening to talk radio.  \n[3]Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants, clangs around. With all this unnecessary new security everywhere, we'll be setting off alarms left and right! \n[4]Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby \n[5]Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up to your divorce proceedings 4 times under court order. You've been served. \n[6] Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his check list - it is a list of people he served that day. He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box that sits in his passenger seat.  \n[7]Fuckin' eh. \n[8]Nice! Hot Steppa! \n[9] \n[10]Just here to check out some units. \n[11]Nope. \n[12]You owe American Express $4068 dollars. Sorry, but you've been served. \n[13] Dale is parked at a look-out enjoying the food, smoking weed and has his ear piece in.  \n[14]Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? \n[15]As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though. Twice a week,  cough  might fix that. Hold on one sec. \n[16]I need Dr. Terrence, immediately. \n[17]Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. And now, because of that, you've been served. \n[18] Dale hits a pipe. It is clear he strongly disagrees with what the DJ is saying.  \n[19]Let me through, damnit. \n[20]You're Joshua Aaron Corber? \n[21]Sorry, but you've been served. \n[22] \n[23] Dale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He lights the joint and   turns on the radio.  \n[24]Hey Kyle. So, should we head back to my place and finish up the trilogy? Matrix: Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man or machine? \n[25]Sure. \n[26]Well, yeah, I really want to meet them. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think. \n[27]Of course. I know that. It's just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole bunch of cases that I can finish tomorrow. It's probably going to take me into the night. \n[28]I will. I promise. I'm not trying to avoid this, for real, I've just been crazy busy. \n[29]Pardon? \n[30]24. \n[31]Dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. It's not that weird. Frankly, it's natural. \n[32]I'll wait in the car. \n[33] Dale and Angie sit in the parked car making out.  \n[34]No...actually I can't. I have to go serve a guy. \n[35]Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang out later though. You can come over. \n[36]Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit? \n[37]What's up, Saul. \n[38]What? \n[39]Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I- \n[40]I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet. \n[41]Um...sure. \n[42]Better than that Blue Oyster weed? \n[43]What is this? It's spectacular. \n[44]So...can I get a quarter? \n[45]Where's the scale? \n[46]Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing? \n[47]You can actually smoke that contraption? \n[48]Well, be careful with that thing. \n[49] \n[50]Holy... \n[51]I'm a process server. \n[52]No, process server. \n[53]I'm hired to give people papers they don't want. It's pretty much the easiest job on earth. \n[54]Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up. \n[55]I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger King- \n[56]Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot- boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend. \n[57]A little. She's in high school. \n[58]No, no. She's 19. \n[59]Yeah, it's awesome, although I think she's getting old enough where she's realizing I don't do much. And these high school guys these days. They're all roided out and going to Harvard. Even on my best days, I look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them. \n[60]Dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world. \n[61]You can actually do whatever the hell you want. You get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night. \n[62]Sorry to hear that. \n[63]Let's see...tonight I'm going after- \n[64]Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his- \n[65]I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there. \n[66]Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks. \n[67] Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house. It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH! Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a \n[68]Oh shit on me. \n[69] \n[70] \n[71]He fucking killed him, man! \n[72] \n[73]Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A lady, and a guy. \n[74]No! A guy! \n[75]No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy! The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking woman, a police woman, and   an old guy, shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking window at Ted's house! \n[76]Which guy? \n[77]I don't fucking know. He was this big, old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he fucking took him, and he shot him! Right there in the fucking window! BAM! \n[78]And they saw me! They saw me see them shoot the guy! \n[79]No! I panicked. I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car. Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at least. They knew someone was there. \n[80]No. I don't think so. No. \n[81]I'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop. They could all be cops! \n[82]Yeah. I saw some blood. \n[83]I don't know, who do drug dealers kill? It was probably another drug dealer. He was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers. \n[84]I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me- \n[85]When I threw it...out...the window... \n[86]This weed is actually that rare? \n[87]So, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed? \n[88]And am I the only guy you gave it to? \n[89]But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right? \n[90] \n[91]I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house! \n[92]No, listen - they could find the roach and say, \"This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him.\" \n[93]Wait! \n[94]Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff. \n[95]Are you sure you're not forgetting anything? \n[96]We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster. \n[97]Go back! Go back! \n[98]Okay, man. We gotta try to relax. \n[99]We don't want to draw attention. \n[100]I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool. \n[101]Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!  The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close.  \n[102]That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm! \n[103]Oh. Pardon. \n[104] Dale peels out of his spot and down the road.  \n[105]Okay, what do you know about Ted? \n[106]No way! What if they did see my license plate!?! \n[107]Well, how much money do we have? \n[108]That's it!?! \n[109]Uh...nine bucks. \n[110]Fine. Forget the hotel. \n[111]Okay...where's nowhere? \n[112]So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were? \n[113]No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you? \n[114]Who is this Red guy? \n[115]But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he? \n[116]Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer. \n[117]Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him. \n[118]You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude. \n[119] \n[120]Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please. \n[121]I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some bull shit. \n[122]What the fuck is that?! \n[123]Are we on fucking \"Lost\"?! What the hell is that?! \n[124] \n[125]Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I can just take the batteries out? \n[126]What the fuck was that?! \n[127]What tree? \n[128]Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why couldn't you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person? \n[129]Did you at least see where it landed? \n[130]With what? I just smashed my phone! \n[131]Well, then you shouldn't have said anything, cause now you've convinced me that they can! \n[132]Do you see it? \n[133]The \"Blair Witch Project.\" \n[134] \n[135] \n[136] \n[137] \n[138]\n[139] Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe the dirt off his suit.  \n[140]Shit. \n[141]\n[142]Is there anyone even out there?!? \n[143]If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!? \n[144]No! We're not going anywhere! \n[145]There's nothing out there, that's why we're here. God, man, you scared the fucking shit out of me. \n[146]Shut up, okay? It's my car. \n[147]Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my own. \n[148]Shut up. \n[149] Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.  \n[150]Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up. \n[151]What's the time? \n[152]What does it say? \n[153]It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to be there at noon! \n[154]It's four o'fucking clock?! \n[155] \n[156]You remember where he lives, right? \n[157]Let's just get out of here. \n[158]What the fuck? Come on. \n[159] \n[160]It's dead. \n[161]How? We fell asleep! \n[162]We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's. \n[163]Yeah, \"for real\". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation. \n[164]Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone. \n[165]So, what's this guy like? \n[166]Well, do you think he'll be there? \n[167]Dale. Nice to meet you. \n[168]I think it's    better if you don't know my last- \n[169]Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay? \n[170]Saul. Ask him.  \n[171]Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well, Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't think we should tell you any more than you need to know.  \n[172]Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you into the shit we're in. It's just trouble.  \n[173]That's why we only need to clarify one thing - nobody's called about Saul or the pineapple express or anything like that?  \n[174]I'm sorry! I'm sorry! \n[175] \n[176]I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can- \n[177] \n[178]He's going for the phone! Bathroom! \n[179] \n[180]Now tell us- \n[181] Dale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It shatters on the back of Red's head.  Red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath, bruised and battered.  \n[182]It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name! \n[183]This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?! \n[184]Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them! \n[185]Well, we have to find out what he knows. \n[186]Tell us everything. Now! \n[187]I think we beat it out of him. \n[188]Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't tell us everything, we're going to beat you up. \n[189]You've got five seconds, okay? Ready? Five, four- \n[190]Three, two...one! \n[191]Who were they? \n[192]How many cops does he have in his...uh, payroll, or whatever? \n[193]Who's his competition? \n[194]Asians? Which Asians? Indians are technically Asian. \n[195]Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here. \n[196]What? \n[197] \n[198] \n[199]No. I've got to get to a phone! \n[200]But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie! \n[201]Why?! \n[202] \n[203] Dale's apartment door BURSTS open. Budlofsky and Matheson enter, guns drawn. They start searching the apartment. Budlofsky presses a button on the ANSWERING MACHINE.  \n[204]Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a minute. \n[205]Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please. \n[206]Angie! \n[207]Nothing, I was in the woods and... ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to finally meet you both...I apologize for my appearance. Robert, Charlotte- \n[208]Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both of you. \n[209]Very nice things. \n[210] \n[211]...that'd be really, really good right now. I'll answer all your- \n[212] \n[213]Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have to get the \"F\" out of here! \n[214]Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was working...this morning. The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off, and I think they might have seen my license plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the woods, so... \n[215]I think their drug dealers. \n[216]Well, it's complicated. See, the...uh...it doesn't matter right now, we just have to get out of here. \n[217]No, they are the police! \n[218]Angie! Stop! It's Saul! \n[219]Stop! Stop! He's with me! \n[220]Sir, please, he's my friend, he's helping me, he's- \n[221]Guys! Please! We have to get out of here. Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson- \n[222]I know! Look, we have to get out of here. I'm sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than...not. \n[223]Yes. Terribly real. \n[224] \n[225]Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name. Something like... Car...lyle. \n[226]I have to stop this. I don't know how, but don't worry. I'll keep you safe. But still, watch your back. You never know where they might be, whoever they are. \n[227]I love you. \n[228]Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you guys. \n[229]Let's run, man! Run! \n[230]Somewhere we can think. \n[231]\"Tell us what you know!\" How fuckin' balls was that? \n[232]And I think I fought pretty well, don't you? You know, for my first time. We were like Tango and Cash, man. \n[233]BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's hinges! \n[234]I probably couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp. \n[235]Thanks, man. You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had. \n[236]Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you. \n[237]So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right? \n[238]What about your sack? \n[239] \n[240]No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids. \n[241]Well, then not kids at that school. \n[242]I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go? \n[243]What's that? \n[244]Fuck this place. \n[245] \n[246]I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah.  \n[247]You touched a tit when you were twelve?  \n[248]Hey!  \n[249]Yeah. She's my girlfriend.  \n[250] \n[251]There are still people trying to kill us. \n[252]I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid of it right away, I was just smoking this. I...I thought it was decriminalized. Or something. For medical purposes. I have epilepsy. \n[253]Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I have is this little joint. \n[254]I don't even have any money! How did I sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I was just smoking it. I swear. Please. \n[255] She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.   \n[256]What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do? \n[257]You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please! \n[258]This...this lady cop, and these guys Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for Ted Jones, and- \n[259]Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He- \n[260]Yeah. An Asian someone. \n[261] \n[262]NO! What are you doing!?! \n[263]No! She was going to help us! \n[264] \n[265]\n[266] The car weaves through traffic.  \n[267]Turn on the wipers! \n[268]Kick out the window! Isn't that what they do? \n[269]Get it out of there! \n[270] \n[271]Do something! \n[272]\n[273]Turn on the sirens! \n[274]\n[275]Saul! Saul! I'm locked in! \n[276]You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!! \n[277]Don't touch me, you asshole! \n[278]Ow! Ow! Hurry! \n[279]Which saw do you like most? \n[280] \n[281]Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please? \n[282]Angie! Thank god you're okay! \n[283]I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So, here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave town and contact a government official or something. From somewhere safe. I know this shit is all fucked up and I just can't apologize enough. \n[284]I know there's a problem! That's the thing, that's why I- \n[285]Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was thrown into this situation, I had no control, but I am dealing with it. This kind of thing happens, you know- \n[286]What? You're telling me you think I'm a dumb guy? \n[287]Are you joking? You're actually gonna smoke marijuana? \n[288]How can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through? That clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana. \n[289]If you haven't noticed, we're not very functional when we're stoned, Saul. \n[290]You didn't save me! She was going to protect us, and now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit! \n[291]Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how \"Scarface\" ends. Face down, dead, in your own fuckin' water fountain. \n[292]It's not my fault! \n[293]It's marijuana's fault! \n[294]Grow up, you fucking two year old. \n[295]Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at least I'm not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world. The only reason I ever bought weed from you was because you're shit is so good, not because you're cool. \n[296]Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots of different kinds of weed at once. \n[297]Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all that! Saul! \n[298]Hey, uh, what's going on here? \n[299]What did? \n[300]Uh...thanks. \n[301]Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's going to be fine. \n[302]Hello? Anyone here? Red? \n[303]Oh my god. \n[304] \n[305]Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy. You don't have to die. \n[306]You don't have to die. \n[307]Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail on him. I'm going to get him back. \n[308]What are you doing? \n[309]You're not coming to help? \n[310]But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul? \n[311]I'll blow his fuckin' brains out if you don't- \n[312]Oh my god. \n[313]I had to try. \n[314]No! I came here to save you! \n[315]Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked you. You're right, this whole things my fault, and they only way I can make it up to you is by rescuing you, and that's why I'm here. To save my friend. \n[316]Good. `Cause I will. \n[317]We're not losers! We did that car chase. That was all you, man! You got away from the cops. I've watched, like, nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and I've never seen a guy get away. Not once! But you did it. You did the impossible. \n[318] \n[319] \n[320] \n[321]This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth. \n[322] \n[323] BLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall!  The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it. Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and-  BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut.     \n[324]What happened? \n[325] \n[326] \n[327]\n[328]You shot him? \n[329]Whoa. \n[330]Uh...stay there. \n[331] \n[332]Were they armed? \n[333]I can't hear them. \n[334]Shoot back! \n[335]\n[336]Now run! \n[337]\n[338]Nice. You got him. \n[339]Holy shit. I killed him. \n[340]You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man. \n[341]Don't worry about me. \n[342]Hold on! \n[343] \n[344]Ha! \n[345]You can't fucking take me. I'm young. Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old and dying. \n[346]\n[347]Sorry, Ted... \n[348]...but you've been served. \n[349]Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!! \n[350]Ow. Ah. Ow. Okay... cough   cough \n[351]Saul! \n[352]Saul!  Cough   Cough  You're okay! \n[353]We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won. \n[354]I have absolutely no idea. \n[355]Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill. \n[356]What's cool is that you came back for me man. You did, right? You weren't just captured again, were you? \n[357]Red? You okay? \n[358]I've gotta get downtown, try and win Angie back.  \n[359]Do you think we should have looked for the ear? They probably could've re- attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks.  \n[360]I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now. I haven't called in for days.  \n[361]What? Why? \n[362]Saul, what're you going to do? \n[363]All I hear is ringing. \n[364]Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know- \n[365]...a little paranoia. \n[366] \n[367] \n[368] \n[369] \n[370]I'm following him. ", "Denton": "\n[1]looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint while listening to talk radio.  \n[2] She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.   ", "Matheson": "\n[1]Look. \n[2] \n[3]Why did he mention the casino? The Asians run the casinos. Is Saul Asian? \n[4]This might be more than we thought. \n[5]Red, you gonna tell us anything helpful? \n[6]You hear that? \n[7]Hey. What skin color were these guys? \n[8]You hear that, Ted? \n[9]Budlofsky! \n[10]Get out your fucking gun! \n[11]Ready? \n[12]Hurry the fuck up. \n[13]Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these people doing? \n[14]Eat it! \n[15]\n[16]Fine. \n[17]Shut the fuck up and keep moving. \n[18]We can hear you out there, and it's annoying. Shut the fuck up. \n[19]Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it, okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut it- \n[20] BLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall!  The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it. Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and-  BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut.     \n[21]\n[22]\n[23] \n[24]Hey Saul! \n[25]I owe you one. In the gut. Then the balls, and then the- "}}
