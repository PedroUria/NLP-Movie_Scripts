She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into \tthe night just as --  \t-- a shaft of blinding UV \"sunlight\" cuts across the vampires. They \trear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade \topens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets \tinto the crowd -- vampire genocide.  \tThe strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires \ttry to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes \tclogged with liquefying bodies --  \t-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their \topening, surge forward en masse --  \tBlade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!- \tunsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip.  \n[2] \tthe lupine Gaultier girl from the club, glides beneath the water, \tsurfacing at the deep end. We SEE --  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tThis is Mercury. Tell Deacon I've \t\tfound their hiding place.  \n[4]\t\tDeacon likes to play with his food \t\tbefore he eats it.  \tFrost laughs. Karen tries to keep calm. The longer she keeps them \ttalking, the longer she remains alive.  \n[5]\t\tIt won't be long now, lover.  \tQuinn draws alongside her, hefting Blade's punching dagger. He places \tit against Blade's throat, slowly applying pressure. At this point, \tBlade's too weak to even resist.  \n[6]\t\t\t \t\tNo. Deacon wants him turned.  \tQuinn releases Blade, disgusted.  \n[7]\t\tDeacon?  \n[8]\t\tHave a taste of your own medicine!  \tAs she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from \ther hand.

Once again, our interests have \t\tfallen victim to his ridiculous \t\tcrusade. He must be destroyed.  \n[2]\t\t\t \t\tDeacon Frost. You refuse to speak our \t\tlanguage, you insult the House of \t\tErebus by using the humans' \t\tgutter-tongue, have you no respect \t\tfor tradition?  \n[3]\t\t\t \t\tI see. And what would you have us do \t\twith this \"half-breed\"?  \n[4]\t\tHe is an abomination!  \tDragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood \tacross the tabletop. Frost looks to the others --  \n[5]\t\tThe shadows suit us, Frost. We've \t\texisted this way for thousands of \t\tyears. Who are you to challenge our \t\tways?  \n[6]\t\tGet out!!!  \tFrost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. Looks at his \tfingers, licks the blood from them.  \n[7]\t\tWhat are you doing here?  \tFrost pauses, SEEING Dragonetti emerge from the shadows.  \n[8]\t\t\t \t\tThese archives are restricted to \t\tmembers of the House of Erebus.  \n[9]\t\tYou're wasting your time, Frost. Far \t\tgreater scholars than you have tried \t\tto decipher these words. Whatever \t\tsecrets they hold have been lost.  \n[10]\t\tWhat are you up to, Frost?  \tFrost shuts the lid on his laptop, rising, drawing intimidatingly \tclose to Dragonetti.  \n[11]\t\t\t \t\tWhat is this? Where am I?!  \tFrost steps forward, pulling Dragonetti's hood off. Dragonetti stares \tat his surroundings, horrified.  \n[12]\t\t\t \t\tThe other elders will never let you \t\tget away with this!  \tJust then, the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS emerge behind Frost, forming a \tcircle around Dragonetti. All wear business suits, gloves, along with \thigh-tech \"sun masks\" to protect their faces from the light's lethal \trays.  \tThey stare at Dragonetti like a silent jury. His face darkens, anger \trising -- but there's a desperation in his eyes now too. He speaks in \tthe secret tongue:  \n[13]\t\t\t \t\tDon't you see, you fools?! He'll \t\tbetray you too! He's planning on \t\tinvoking LaMagra himself!  \tThe vampires just smile and shake their heads.  ", "Racquel": "", "Karen": "\n[1]\t\tYou took this off a DOA?  \tCurtis sits on a stool nearby, slowly nodding.  \n[2]\t\tThis isn't human blood.  \n[3]\t\tI don't know -- \t\t\t \t\tLook at this blood smear --  \tCurtis takes a look for himself.  \n[4]\t\tThe red blood cells are biconvex, \t\twhich is theoretically impossible. \t\tThey're hypochromic, there's virtually \t\tno hemoglobin in them. \t\t\t \t\tLook at the PMNs, they're binucleated, \t\tthey should be mononucleated.  \n[5]\t\tCurtis, it's three in the morning. I'm \t\treally not in the mood for one of your \t\tpractical jokes.  \n[6]\t\tI thought you promised to give me some \t\tdistance?  \n[7]\t\tFive minutes, not a second more. And I \t\tdon't want to hear a word about \"us\".  \n[8]\t\tYou haven't started in on the internal \t\torgans?  \n[9]\t\tWhat?  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\tSometimes --  \tCurtis looks up from the corpse, grinning beneath his mask.  \n[11]\t\t-- but then I remember what an \t\tass-hole you were and I'm snapped back \t\tto reality.  \n[12] \tThe sound of RUSHING BLOOD pounding through her skull. Everything \tspinning. She struggles to move, turns her head, finds herself eye to \teye with Curtis' corpse.  \n[13]\t\t\t \t\tMy shoulder -- dislocated --  \tBlade places a hand on her shoulder, another around her elbow and \twithout any consideration to discomfort -CRACK!- brutally pops it \tback in place. Karen SCREAMS again as he scoops her up once more and \theads for --  \n[14]\t\tWhat -- ?  \n[15] \tgrowing darker by the moment. The last thing she sees is Blade \tstaring down at her -- then the night closes in.  \n[16] \tShe draws back, instinctively knowing that she's just witnessed \tsomething she shouldn't have. She looks for an exit, SEES another \tdoorway. She makes for it --  \n[17]\t\tI'm sorry, I --  \n[18]\t\tWho are you people?  \n[19]\t\tYou're joking --  \n[20]\t\tWhy did you help me?  \tBlade scowls, his gaze flickering to Whistler.  \n[21]\t\tWhy?  \n[22]\t\tWhat happens then?  \tBlade looks to Whistler -- as far as he's concerned, the debate's \tover.  \n[23]\t\t\t \t\tSo what do you use, then? A stake?  \n[24]\t\tAnd you honestly expect me to believe \t\tall this?  \n[25]\t\tI can't just leave. I have a life \t\there, a career --  \n[26]\t\tI can go to the police. I have blood \t\tsamples back at the hospital. I can \t\tshow them.  \n[27]\t\tThat's ridiculous! No one's that \t\tpowerful.  \tWhistler sighs. He doesn't suffer fools gladly.  \n[28]\t\t\t \t\tSo that's it? You guys just patch me \t\tup and send me on my way?  \n[29] \tAs Karen climbs out, Blade swings the door shut behind her. The Olds \tROARS off down the quiet residential street.  \n[30] \tThe elevator doors open. Karen hurries out, heads left, finds herself \tin a deserted hallway. She looks back --  \t-- then skips a heartbeat as the trio also step out! As Karen raises \tthe canister of mace --  \t-- the trio turn and head down to the right. Karen breathes a sigh of \trelief, shakes her head.  \n[31] \tKaren enters quickly, bolting the door behind her. She picks up the \tphone, dials 911 --  \n[32]\t\tI need the police. This is an \t\temergency --  \tAs Karen waits to be connected, she moves to the back entrance and \tchecks the locks -- then the windows, then the fire escape -- \tfinally, a VOICE comes on the other end.  \n[33]\t\tHello? My name is Karen Jansen, I was \t\twith Curtis Webb at Mid-Town Hospital \t\tlast night -- that's right, I \t\twitnessed the attack -- \t\t\t \t\t115 Aurora, apartment 3G. Yes, I'll \t\twait here. Please hurry.  \tKaren hangs up the phone and turns --  \n[34]\t\tGet a grip on yourself, girl.  \tShe sinks down into a chair to wait, setting Whistler's vampire mace \taside. Then she shuts her eyes, massaging her temples. We SEE --  \n[35]\t\tWho is it?  \n[36] \tA POLICE OFFICER stands in the hallway -- 30s, handsome, a knight in \tshining armor as far as she's concerned.  \n[37]\t\tYes, that was me, I'm Karen Jansen --  \tGideon smiles, takes a quick glance around the room, then studies \tKaren's face, the bandages on her neck.  \n[38]\t\tI know. Listen -- do you have any idea \t\twhat happened to Curtis, the other \t\tdoctor?  \n[39]\t\t\t \t\tWhy?  \tGideon's smile vanishes as he unholsters his gun.  \n[40]\t\tHe said it would work against \t\tvampires --  \tGideon bursts out laughing.  \n[41]\t\tHow did you know?  \n[42]\t\tYou used me as bait?!  \n[43]\t\tBut, he could've --  \n[44]\t\tBut he's a policeman --  \n[45]\t\tWhy in God's name would anyone want to \t\twork for them?  \n[46]\t\tAnd that's a good thing?  \n[47] \tBlade and Karen are now standing by Gideon's police cruiser which is \tparked outside Karen's apartment. Blade shoves Gideon against the \thood of the cruiser. He finds Gideon's keys, moves to the trunk, \topens it --  \n[48]\t\tWhat are you doing?!  \n[49]\t\tYou can't do this, he's human, it's \t\tmurder.  \n[50]\t\tYou were going to kill him. What was I \t\tsupposed to do?! Shut my eyes and \t\tpretend I didn't see what I saw?  \tBlade tears off his glasses. Karen gasps --  \n[51] \twho's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright. \tBlade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn \tjust the slightest taste of blood.  \n[52]\t\tI remembered the address. I followed \t\tyou --  \tBlade shakes his head, amazed.  \n[53]\t\tLook, if what you say is true, if \t\tthere's a chance I could turn into one \t\tof them, then I've got no choice, do \t\tI? I have to work with you. I need to \t\tlearn everything I can about them. \t\tIt's the only way I'll be able to find \t\ta cure for myself.  \n[54]\t\t\t \t\tYou don't know that.  \tBlade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti- \tcovered wall intently --  \n[55]\t\tWhat are you looking at?  \n[56]\t\tGraffiti --  \n[57]\t\t\t \t\tI know this place -- it's a blood \t\tbank.  \n[58]\t\tNo.  \tBlade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.  \n[59]\t\tWhat if you've made a mistake?  \tBlade pins Tanaka's head to the wall, turning it to the side -- \trevealing the man's glyph. It's different than Gideon's, looking more \tlike a Japanese kanji character.  \n[60]\t\tYou let him go -- \t\t\t \t\tAn hour ago you were ready to kill a \t\tman for less, this one didn't even \t\ttalk.  \n[61]\t\tHow can you tell?  \n[62]\t\tSo many of them -- I still can't \t\tbelieve they're real.  \n[63]\t\tLike what?  \n[64]\t\tWhat is this place?  \n[65]\t\tIsn't this all a little high-tech? I \t\tthought vampires were more into \t\tcobwebs and coffins.  \n[66]\t\tHe moved.  \tBlade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. BOOM! Blade \tkicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges --  \n[67]\t\tWhat are these?  \n[68]\t\tHow did you find us?!  \tWhistler taps a tiny radio headset curled around his ear.  \n[69]\t\t\t \t\tYou've been listening in the whole \t\ttime?  \n[70]\t\tWhistler!  \n[71]\t\tYou're hurt --  \n[72]\t\tWhat am I injecting you with?  \n[73]\t\tYou're one of them, aren't you?  \tBlade turns away from Karen, filled with self-loathing.  \n[74]\t\tWhy didn't you tell me the truth \t\tabout him?  \n[75]\t\tWhat happens if he doesn't take the \t\tserum?  \n[76]\t\tNo offense, Whistler, but you're not \t\texactly working with state of the art \t\tequipment here. You might have missed \t\tsomething.  \n[77]\t\tWhy do you hunt them?  \n[78]\t\tHe killed them?  \n[79]\t\tHow did you escape?  \n[80]\t\tAnd now you're using Blade to exact \t\tyour revenge?  \n[81]\t\tI'll take my chances.  \n[82]\t\tBlade?  \tNo answer. Then Karen SEES him -- crouched in the corner of the room \tlike some kind of nocturnal animal.  \n[83]\t\tIt's dark in here.  \n[84]\t\tWhistler told me about your mother.  \tBlade clutches the silver locket in his hand. It swings back and \tforth, like a pendulum.  \n[85]\t\tThose aren't real memories. No one has \t\tthat kind of recall.  \n[86]\t\tIf you're not human, then why do you \t\tbleed like us? \t\tI've seen vampire blood, you don't \t\thave it running through your veins.  \tBlade looks at Karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.  \n[87]\t\tBlade --  \tBlade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury.  \n[88]\t\tI made a trip to the hospital last \t\tnight, borrowed some equipment.  \n[89]\t\tThis is sodium citrate. It's an \t\tanti-coagulant. We use it to treat \t\tblood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood \t\tis thinner than humans, though. Watch \t\twhat happens when I introduce some \t\tinto a sample --  \tKaren gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --  \n[90]\t\tBefore you go, I'd like to take a \t\tsample of your blood.  \tBlade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. As Karen takes her sample, \tBlade looks to Whistler. The older man brings a handkerchief to his \tlips, coughing into it.  \n[91]\t\tIs he sick?  \n[92]\t\tYou care about him, don't you?  \n[93]\t\t\t \t\tMy mother used to say that a cold \t\theart is a dead heart.  \n[94]\t\tSome. It's been slow --  \n[95]\t\tI'm just tired, that's all. We've been \t\tup all night.  \tBlade nods, not buying her explanation. He shoots a glance to \tWhistler, which doesn't go unnoticed by Karen.  \n[96]\t\tExcuse me.  \tKaren turns, heading for the back of the workshop.  \n[97]\t\tYou make it sound like I'm already \t\tdead.  \tBlade just stares at her. Finally, she pulls away.  \n[98]\t\tAll right, let's start with the basics \t\t-- why do vampires need to drink \t\tblood?  \n[99]\t\tThen vampirism is a genetic defect, \t\tjust like Hemolytic anemia?  \tWhistler nods.  \n[100]\t\tSo what about gene therapy?  \tWhistler looks intrigued. Karen continues.  \n[101]\t\tBasically you'd have to re-write the \t\tvictim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA \t\twill produce proteins capable of \t\tgenerating hemoglobin.  \n[102]\t\tWith a retrovirus. It's injected into \t\tthe bone marrow cells, it causes the \t\thost's DNA to mutate. They've been \t\tusing them to treat Sickle-cell \t\tanemia.  \tWhistler can hardly believe what he's hearing.  \n[103]\t\tOn me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so \t\tsure -- \t\t\t \t\tThe problem is, Blade didn't contract \t\tthe vampire virus from a bite like I \t\tdid. He was born with it. The irony \t\tis, I could probably cure every \t\tvampire but him.  \n[104]\t\tWhat happened to the power?  \n[105]\t\tWhy haven't you killed me yet?  \n[106]\t\tHow many of you are there?  \n[107]\t\tWhat happens then?  \n[108]\t\tLaMagra --  \n[109]\t\tYou.  \n[110]\t\tThere's no need for any of this. Your \t\tcondition can be treated. Whistler and \t\tI were working on a cure when --  \n[111]\t\tBut you use blood banks --  \n[112]\t\tYou're a monster.  \n[113] \tsits nearby, watching him. From the steady rocking motion and the \tSOUNDS of traffic outside, it's evident that they are in the back of \ta moving truck.  \n[114]\t\tAre you all right?  \n[115]\t\t\t \t\tI don't know. I woke up just before \t\tyou did --  \tAs he struggles to sit up, she crosses over to him. Blade shuts his \teyes for a moment, fighting a wave of pain.  \n[116]\t\tIs it bad?  \n[117]\t\t\t \t\tIt won't work on you.  \n[118]\t\tYour condition's congenital, the \t\tgenetic mutations occurred in utero. \t\tAll the other victims contracted \t\tvampirism after birth.  \tBlade stares at Karen, disbelieving. Who could imagine a more \thorrifying irony? She's crying now. She can't help it.  \n[119]\t\tI can't cure you, Blade. I can cure \t\tmyself, but I can't cure you. \t\t\t \t\tI'm so sorry.  \tBlade's head sinks, the last vestiges of hope draining out of him.  \tAnd then, as if the final stake were being pounded in, the truck \tlurches to a stop. We hear the ENGINE being killed, then FOOTSTEPS \tapproaching, and then a series of BOLTS BEING SHIFTED as --  \t-- the back of the truck is thrown open. Frost stands there, \tgrinning, flanked by Mercury, Quinn, Vanessa, and a half-dozen other \n[120]\t\tBlade --  \n[121]\t\tCurtis?!  \tWhat used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift- \tpile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her, \tgurgling through its gutted trachea.  \n[122]\t\t\t \t\tBlade.  \tBlade's eyes flicker open, fixing on her. Inhuman. He's shaking \tlike an alcoholic going into delirium tremens.  \n[123]\t\tI'm not leaving without you.  \n[124]\t\tI know. Take some of my blood.  \n[125]\t\tIt's the only way. You know that. \t\tWe'll never get out of here alive if \t\tyou don't.  \tBlade suppresses a shudder. Simply keeping himself from attacking her \ttakes every ounce of his resolve.  \n[126]\t\tYes you will. The human side of you is \t\tstronger. I know it is.  \tKaren matches Blade's gaze, steeling herself. The truth is, she's \tterrified.  \tBlade stares back at her. At this moment, he wants what Karen is \toffering more than anything he's ever desired. And so he rises --  \n[127]\t\tDon't stop --  \tBut Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares \tat Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw \twounds on her neck, shaken --  \n[128]\t\tMy God --  \tBlade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned, \tit's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's \tsomething else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing \tbefore. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness.  \n[129]\t\t\t \t\tAre you -- all right?  \tBlade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart \tlike toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered \tpoints. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have \telongated into fangs.  \n[130] \twho takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.  \tMeanwhile, Blade traps Mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping \ther over his shoulder. He hefts his Casull, BLASTING her into \teternity --  \tA bloodbath ensues. Blade moves like speed-personified, FIRING off \tone, two, THREE HEADSHOTS with brain-numbing accuracy, cutting down \tthe vampires where they stand.  \tIt's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and \t-CLICK-CA-CHING-CLICK!- Blade and Karen have spent their bullets \tand --  \n[131] \tas she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's \tdiscarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the \tperiphery of her vision --  \n[132]\t\tGet away from him!  \tFrost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down \ton Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The \tblood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He \tgasps, chokes in air --  \tFrost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform. \tInstead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline \tpowder.  \n[133]\t\tBlade!  \tKaren flings the sword at Blade.  \n[134]\t\tBlade?  \tBlade turns. Karen moves to him, searching his eyes. Which side of \tBlade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?  \tThen she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in \ta lifetime. Human.  \tThey embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And \twe --  \n[135]\t\tI never imagined I'd be so happy to \t\tsee the sun rise -- \t\t\t \t\tIt's over, isn't it?  ", "Vanessa": "\n[1] \tBlade's mother!!! Although some thirty years have passed since the \tevents of our prologue, Vanessa looks exactly the same -- vibrant, \tbeautiful, full of life. Her eyes open.  \n[2]\t\tJason.  \tBlade gasps, uncomprehending.  \n[3]\t\tI've missed you so much, Jason. \t\t\t \t\tYou have no idea what I've been \t\tthrough, how much I've wanted to see \t\tyou --  \tBlade falters, his mind reeling. What he's seeing is incomprehensible \t-- his mother is dead. Yet, here she is in the flesh, reaching out to \thim and --  \t-- flashing a mouthful of viper-like fangs! She SNARLS and strikes, \tbrutally raking her claws across Blade's face, knocking the sword \tfrom his grasp --  \n[4]\t\t\t \t\tDeacon brought me back.  \n[5]\t\tYes.  \tFrost kisses Vanessa hungrily. Then he kneels and reaches into \tBlade's jacket, retrieving a vial of Blade's serum.  \n[6]\t\tListen to your father, Jason. It's \t\tgoing to be a better world.  \tBlade stares at Vanessa uncomprehending.  \n[7]\t\tThere's no use fighting us, Jason.  \tBlade looks up, focusing now on --  \n[8] \twho has remained behind. Blade stares at her. As terrible as his \tphysical torment is, his mother's betrayal is infinitely worse.  \n[9]\t\tThese are my people now. I'm one of \t\tthem.  \n[10]\t\tYou don't understand. I've killed, \t\tI've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.  \tShe draws closer, caressing her son's face. There's just a hint of \tcreepy eroticism in her action, a dash of incest.  \n[11]\t\tI wish you could see the world as I \t\tdo. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no \t\tturning back from that.  \n[12]\t\tYou will. Time is on our side. Sooner \t\tor later, the Thirst always wins.  \tVanessa turns away now. Blade cries after her --  \n[13]\t\tYour mother died the night you \t\twere born.  \tAnd with that, she's gone, melting into the shadows.  \n[14] \trushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in \tan eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning \ther.  \n[15]\t\tDid you think I'd forgotten you, you \t\tlittle whore?  \n[16] \tas she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.  \tAs Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip \tpocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!  \tShe forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into \tVanessa's face --  \tVanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with \tformic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for \tBlade's sword --  ", "Pearl": "\n[1] \tTokyo town. A black edifice, no windows, secured parking, no signage \texcept for a purple neon scroll above the entrance -- a FLASHING \tKANJI, just like the glyph tattooed on Tanaka's neck.  \tTanaka's Mustang pulls into the parking lot. He climbs out, flagging \taway the valets, heads inside --  \n[2] \tBlade and Karen climb out. He lets his shotgun fall within the folds \tof his longcoat and starts across the street -- only to be challenged \tby a HULKING DOORMAN at the entrance.  \n[3] \tCRASH! The front door flies open as the Doorman's body sails through. \tBlade enters, Karen at his heels --  \tThe 'Pearl' is an all-hours strip club cum casino catering \texclusively to Japanese zaibatsu clientele. Dimly lit, the air thick \twith cigarette smoke, deafening MUSIC. Go boards, pachinko machines, \tsexy little MANGA WAIFS in schoolgirl outfits doling out drinks --  \tSTRIPPERS writhe in the circular \"pit\" tables surrounded by HOWLING \tgrab-ass men. But that's nothing compared to --  \tThe MAIN ATTRACTION,  \twho's doing a bump and grind down the runway, shaking a body worthy \tof a schoolboy's wet dream. Her attire? A leather S&amp;M face mask, \tnipple rings, 6-inch spikes, and a pair of panties to hide her \tmodesty.  \tBlade scans the room -- just in time to see Tanaka ducking into a \tback hallway. Blade pushes towards the rear of the club. Karen \tfollows.  \n[4] \tBlade and Karen head past the bathrooms. At the end of the hall is a \tdoor marked \"OFFICE\". Just then, the Men's door opens, a DRUNK \tCOLLEGE KID steps out, SEES Blade --  \n[5] \tTanaka spins around, startled, tries to throw a punch --  \tBlade traps Tanaka's arm, levering the man up and over. He CRASHES \tinto a shelving unit, taking the whole thing down with him. Karen \twinces. Blade grabs a handful of Tanaka's hair, yanks his head up --  \n[6] \tThe elevator descends. Then a tone CHIMES, signaling the end of the \tride. The doors hiss open --  \n[7] \tA vestibule of sorts, leading to a larger bed chamber constructed of \trice paper shoji screens and tatami mats. Candles glow within, \tilluminating a MONSTROUSLY OBESE SHADOW beyond the translucent rice \tpaper walls.  \tThe shadow speaks in a tremulous, bird-like voice -- the secret \ttongue. As Blade draws his sword, the massive shadow freezes --  \n[8]\t\t\t \t\tLorca, is that you?  \tBlade slides open the nearest shoji screen --  \n[9] \tNothing Karen's seen up until this point could prepare her for the \tarchive's curator --  \n[10] \ta nine-hundred-pound androgynous vampire of Asian origin, lounging \tamidst pillowed rice mats, wearing a communications headset. Think of \ta cross between Divine and Jabba The Hutt. Skin the complexion of \tbuttermilk, so corpulent he can barely move, so engorged with blood \tthat he's actually sweating it from the pores of his skin.  \tPearl is surrounded by a nest of monitors and keyboards which have \tbeen affixed to counter-balanced arms -- this way, Pearl can access \tinformation without leaving bed.  \tLying next to Pearl, dwarfed by the vampire's massive size, is the \tchalk-white body of a recently-drained NAKED BOY.  \tAt the sight of Blade, Pearl's eyes widen in fear --  \n[11]\t\t\t \t\tHe's here!  \n[12] \tAs Blade listens, Pearl reaches for his trackball, attempting to \tdelete the document currently on his monitors -- but Blade lunges \tforward, sinking the tip of his sword into Pearl's fleshy throat. \tPearl freezes.  \n[13]\t\tHe has a knife to my throat, Frost! \t\tHe --  \n[14] \tCLICK, the line goes dead. Blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens \tit. Inside is a hand-held UV lamp hooked up to a nine-volt battery. \tPearl eyes the device, fearful --  \n[15]\t\tWhat is that?  \n[16]\t\t\t \t\tIt's an epistle, a letter Frost has \t\tbeen translating -- it prophesizes \t\tLaMagra's return.  \n[17]\t\tLaMagra is The Sleeper!!!  \tBlade leans in close so he's eye to eye with Pearl.  \n[18]\t\tThe vault --  \tBlade follows Pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back, \thanding the UV rig to Karen.  \n[19]\t\tPlease, I'll give you the combination \t\t-- you'll damage the documents --  \n[20] \tThe vampires fling Blade against the wall, pinning him.  \n[21] \tAn EXPLOSION rips through the bedchamber, mushrooming outward --  \n[22] \tThe EXPLOSION continues expanding, sending tables, drinks, and \tzaibatsu clientele flying.  ", "Deacon": "\n[1] \ta mere \"Underlord\" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward. \tStrikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors, \tfueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community \the's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a \tracial supremacist.  \n[2] \tsteps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight, \tfollowed by Mercury and Quinn.  \n[3] \tstands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him \tin ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses, \tkissing her hungrily.  \tHaving finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have \tbeen faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A \thush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense \tthat something remarkable is about to happen.  ", "Frost": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tYou're wrong, Dragonetti.  \tAll heads turn. Who would dare such impudence?  \n[2] \ta mere \"Underlord\" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward. \tStrikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors, \tfueled with a passionate intensity. Amongst the vampire community \the's known as an agitator. He's also the vampire equivalent of a \tracial supremacist.  \n[3]\t\tThe Day Walker represents a unique \t\topportunity. We'd be fools to waste \t\tit by killing him.  \n[4]\t\tWhy should I respect something which \t\thas outlived its purpose?  \tThis causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. Frost might as \twell have slapped Dragonetti in the face.  \n[5]\t\tStudy him. Unlock the secrets of his \t\tDNA. He's the key we've been looking \t\tfor.  \n[6]\t\tWhy should we spend our lives \t\tcringing from the daylight when his \t\tblood offers us an alternative? \t\tEnough talk. It's time we stepped out \t\tof the shadows!  \tDragonetti looks apoplectic. ELDER PALLINTINE, a five-hundred year- \told vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.  \n[7]\t\tAm I? Or am I just the first to say \t\tout loud what we've all been \t\tthinking?  \tThe fact that no one answers is telling. Dragonetti glowers at the \tother Elders, sensing the tide turning.  \n[8]\t\tSomeone who's sick of living off \t\tscraps. The coming age belongs to us, \t\tnot the humans! \t\t\t \t\tWhen the final war between our races \t\tcomes, who do you want leading the \t\tcharge?  \tFrost stabs an accusing finger at the Overlord.  \n[9]\t\tSome withered up fossil ready to snap \t\tlike a brittle bone at the first sign \t\tof change?  \tDragonetti GROWLS like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro \tvampire's face, knocking him to the ground.  \n[10]\t\tCareful, old fang. You might wake up \t\tone day and find yourself extinct.  \tFrost smiles at Dragonetti and calmly exits the room.  \n[11] \ttucked away in a carrel, surrounded by books and scriptures, with \tonly the SICKLY GLOW of his laptop to provide light.  \n[12]\t\tPlease. You and the other Elders \t\twouldn't know what to do with these \t\ttexts if your lives depended on it. \t\t\t \t\tWhich, of course, they do.  \n[13]\t\tPerhaps.  \tFrost studies Dragonetti, a self-satisfied grin on his face. If the \tact was intended to unnerve Dragonetti, it succeeded, though the \tancient vampire would never admit it.  \n[14]\t\tWouldn't you like to know, Old Fang?  \tA beat as the young turk stares his elder down. Dragonetti is the \tfirst to lose his nerve. Frost smiles and exits, leaving the old \tvampire to lick his wounds.  \tCAMERA DRIFTS back to the hulking silhouette, which has been \teavesdropping on the conversation. It quivers in fear.  \n[15] \tSuffused lighting, elegant tile-work featuring evocative mosaics, the \tquiet strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC --  \n[16] \tlounging in a chair, studying a laptop which rests beside him. On the \tscreen is a digitized image -- a page taken from an ancient \tmanuscript, written in a secret tongue.  \tOfficer Gideon waits nearby, cradling his ruined hand, his battered \tface cast downward like a boy who's been called into the Principal's \toffice.  \n[17]\t\tCrestfallen.  \n[18]\t\tTell me something, Gideon, what blood \t\ttype are you?  \tGideon hesitates. Is this a trick question?  \n[19]\t\tTake a wild stab. A? B? O, perhaps? \t\tI'm interested in the antigens here, \t\tthe agglutination reaction --  \tGideon stammers as Frost rises. In the blink of an eye, Frost lifts \tGideon from the floor, dangling the Officer over the deep end of the \tpool by his throat --  \n[20]\t\tI'm going to guess AB positive.  \tGideon GURGLES as Frost's fingernails pierce his flesh, drawing \tblood. Then Frost releases him --  \tGideon plunges into the pool. Mercury is on him in a heartbeat, \ttearing him apart like a Great White consuming a piece of chum. The \twater churns violently around them, clouding with red.  \tWhen it's over, Mercury rises from the pool, dripping wet, covered \tfrom head to toe in a crimson sheen.  \tShe kisses Frost hungrily, letting Gideon's blood flow from her mouth \tto his. Frost flicks a tongue over his lips.  \n[21]\t\tAB positive. Give the man a prize.  \tBelow them, Gideon's lifeless body sinks towards the pool bottom, his \tpolice badge twinkling like sunken treasure.  \n[22]\t\t\t \t\tCongratulations, Day-Walker.  \n[23] \tFrost paces the length of his pool, wearing a hands-free \tcommunications headset, grinning.  \n[24]\t\tIn the flesh, Blade. I understand \t\tyou've been looking for me. I'm \t\tflattered.  \n[25] \tFrost settles into his chair, enjoying the cat and mouse.  \n[26]\t\tYou're quick, Blade, I'll give you \t\tthat. In the space of an hour you've \t\tcrossed my familiar, destroyed a blood \t\tbank -- \t\t\t \t\tNow here you are in the heart of our \t\tarchives, terrorizing our curator.  \n[27]\t\t\t \t\tYou're history, Pearl. Have the good \t\tgrace to die with some dignity. \t\t\t \t\tRound one to you, Blade.  \n[28] \tFrost turns away from window. Quinn, Mercury, and the other vampires \tfrom the Black Pearl stand before him. Quinn cradles his amputated \tstump with his newly grown arm.  \n[29]\t\tYou seem to be in the habit of losing \t\tthem fairly often, Quinn. Maybe the \t\tamputee lifestyle just suits you.  \tThe other vampires laugh. Quinn stares them into silence.  \n[30]\t\tDown, boy. Blade's not going anywhere. \t\tI promise. Right now, though, we've \t\tmore pressing business -- \t\t\t \t\tIt's time Dragonetti paid the piper.  \n[31]\t\tRise and shine, little wing.  \n[32]\t\tWhen was the last time you stopped to \t\tappreciate a sunrise, Dragonetti? \t\tThree, four hundred years?  \tFrost checks his watch, then looks to the ocean. On the horizon, a \tsliver of gold appears.  \n[33]\t\tHow do you like that? Right on time.  \n[34]\t\tThe wheel turns, old fang. Guess you \t\tjust got a little too long in the \t\ttooth.  \tDragonetti's cries are cut short as Frost forces the aging vampire's \tmouth open, ripping out his fangs with his bare hands. Dragonetti \tGURGLES and SHRIEKS, sounding like a dying animal.  \tFrost turns to face the Twelve now, his eyes bright with victory. He \tpulls on his motorcycle helmet, as do Mercury and Quinn.  \tBehind them, Dragonetti struggles furiously against his chains to no \tavail as the first faint rays of daylight fall upon him, channeled \tinward by the natural formation of the cove --  \tDragonetti HOWLS, his skin beginning sizzle and smoke. Then he \tcatches fire like paper beneath a magnifying glass. He thrashes about \tas his flesh starts to run from his body.  \n[35]\t\tDragonetti was right. You were fools \t\tto trust me.  \tFrost flips down the visor of his helmet even as --  \n[36]\t\tEasy.  \tFrost's hand rests on the back of the girl's neck. We see his claws \textend, caressing the flesh beneath her chin.  \n[37]\t\tWouldn't want our little friend here \t\tto wind up on the back of a milk \t\tcarton, would we?  \tBlade reluctantly lowers his hand. Frost smiles. He takes in a deep \tbreath of air, savoring it.  \n[38]\t\tBeautiful day, isn't it?  \n[39]\t\tI dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical \t\tresearch. We've developed a type of \t\tsun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a \t\tfew others things.  \tOn closer examination we see that Frost is wearing a translucent \tlotion on his face. He touches a finger to his cheek, rubs some of \tthe lotion between his fingers.  \n[40]\t\tIt's not very effective in direct \t\tsunlight, but it's a start. The goal, \t\tof course, is to be like you, \"the \t\tDay-walker\".  \n[41]\t\tWhy not? The future of our race runs \t\tthrough your bloodstream. You've got \t\tthe best of both worlds, Blade. All of \t\tour strengths and none of our \t\tweaknesses.  \n[42]\t\tOh, so it's back to pretending we're \t\thuman again, is it? Spare me the Uncle \t\tTom routine. You can't keep denying \t\twhat you are. You're one of us, Blade. \t\tYou always have been.  \n[43]\t\tAm I? You think the humans will ever \t\taccept a half-breed like you? They \t\tcan't. They're afraid of you. \t\t\t \t\tThe humans fear us because we're \t\tsuperior. They fear us because in \t\ttheir hearts they know their race has \t\tbecome obsolete.  \tFrost watches the marketers stream past, sneering in contempt.  \n[44]\t\tLook at them, just an endless stream \t\tof cattle in a mad race to the \t\tslaughterhouse.  \tFrost lifts a silver flask to his mouth, taking a swig of blood. He \tsmacks his lips, sighs contentedly --  \n[45]\t\tThe pause that refreshes -- \t\t\t \t\tCare for some? Smells good, doesn't \t\tit? Pungent, with just an \t\tirrepressible hint of iron.  \n[46]\t\tYou sure now? I bled a newborn for \t\tthis. You won't find a drink that's \t\tsweeter.  \tIt takes every ounce of Blade's self-control to keep from attacking \tFrost -- and Frost senses this, pressing his sharp thumbnail against \tthe child's jugular.  \n[47]\t\tTell me honestly, do you really get \t\tthe same rush from that pasteurized \t\tpiss-serum of yours? \t\t\t \t\tYou're surprised I know about your \t\tserum? You shouldn't be. I know \t\teverything about you.  \tFrost leans forward, grinning.  \n[48]\t\tYou can't keep walking the razor's \t\tedge, Blade. The day will come -- and \t\tsoon, when you'll have to choose \t\tbetween our kind and their's. If I \t\twere you, I'd take care not to wind up \t\ton the wrong end of the fang.  \tA bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount \tof the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly \tblackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.  \n[49]\t\tLove to continue this chat, but it \t\tappears I'm melting.  \tFrost rises, taking the little girl by the hand. Blade follows, his \thand resting on the butt of his Casull.  \n[50]\t\t\t \t\tWatch me.  \tFrost's eyes flicker towards the street -- a CITY BUS is rumbling by. \tIn a heartbeat, Frost hurls the little girl forward --  \t-- out into the path of the oncoming bus!  \tBlade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a \tmoment we actually think he's going to go for Frost --  \t-- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms, \tthrowing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a \thair. By the time Blade looks up again --  \t-- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as \tmarket-goers gather around him.  \n[51]\t\tWords to live by, Whistler.  \tWhistler spins, eyes wide. He knows that voice.  \n[52] \tsteps into the pool of illumination thrown off by the flashlight, \tfollowed by Mercury and Quinn.  \n[53]\t\tIt's been a long time, hasn't it, \"old \t\tfriend\"?  \n[54]\t\tHello, Blade. By the time you watch \t\tthis, Whistler will no doubt be \t\twinging his way to Heaven, thanks to \t\tyour capable hands. If it makes any \t\tdifference to you, he put up quite a \t\tfight.  \tFrost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.  \n[55]\t\tNow, I'm sure you're wondering about \t\tMs. Jansen's well-being. She's alive \t\tand kicking -- \"ambulatory\", as they \t\tlike to say in the trade. Whether or \t\tnot she remains so is entirely up to \t\tyou. \t\t\t \t\tI'll make this as easy as possible for \t\tyou, Blade. You can find us at the \t\tEdgewood Towers. We'll be waiting with \t\tbaited breath.  \tThe tape cuts to static. Blade throws the camcorder against the wall. \tIt shatters into a dozen pieces.  \tBlade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment Karen \tbrought from the hospital. He moves to the refrigerator, removing a \tcanister labeled \"SODIUM CITRATE\". Then he draws his sword. We can \tpractically see the wheels turning within his mind --  \n[56] \tSparse decor in a Neo-Japanese vein. Minimalist lighting. The walls \tare glass. Recirculating pumps send a constant stream of water \tcascading down them.  \tKaren is escorted into the room by Mercury. She gestures to a chair \tat the end of a long table. Karen sits.  \n[57] \tleans forward out of the shadows, resting his elbows on the table, \thands steepled together.  \n[58]\t\tWell, here we are, Doctor.  \tA cigarette appears in Frost's hand. In the blink of an eye, the \tcigarette is lit, burning. The movements are so quick we barely have \ttime to register them.  \n[59]\t\tA few thousand scattered about the \t\tglobe. In the past, we've had to \t\trestrict our numbers for fear of \t\tdiscovery. That won't be necessary \t\tafter tonight.  \n[60]\t\tThe Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied \t\tholy war against the humans. There's a \t\tforce, you see -- a spirit that exists \t\tin our blood. I've discovered a way to \t\tinvoke it.  \n[61]\t\tThat's right. The answers were there \t\tall along, of course, scribbled down \t\tin the forgotten languages of my kind. \t\tWaiting for someone with the patience \t\tto decipher them. \t\tMy elders were foolish enough to \t\tdismiss them as wives tales. But I \t\tknew better. \t\t\t \t\tImagine my surprise when Blade turned \t\tout to be the key which would set that \t\tforce free.  \tFrost sits forward now, impassioned.  \n[62]\t\tLaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a \t\tspirit, requiring a flesh and blood \t\thost in order to manifest himself.  \n[63]\t\tWho better to usher in the Blood Tide?  \tKaren shakes her head, protesting --  \n[64]\t\tWhat makes you think we want to be \t\tcured? Blood is only part of the \t\tequation. The hunt, the killing, \t\tthat's what the Thirst is really \t\tabout.  \n[65]\t\tOnly as a last resort. Preserved blood \t\tis inferior. There's no flavor left to \t\tit, no life. \t\t\t \t\tFortunately, I've found a way around \t\tthat particular obstacle.  \tFrost moves to the end of the room. He pushes a button. With a HUM \tthe wall slides open, revealing something Karen wishes she'd never \tseen -- living blood banks.  \n[66]\t\tUnder these conditions I can keep a \t\tdonor alive for years, producing \t\tanywhere from fifty to a hundred pints \t\tof blood. \t\t\t \t\tOf course, this is just a pilot \t\tprogram, really. Once the Tide comes, \t\twe'll need to expand production. So \t\tmany more mouths to feed --  \tKaren turns away, overwhelmed by revulsion.  \n[67]\t\tWhy? Because we live at another \t\tspecies' expense? Your people farm \t\tcattle and veal, don't they? Fattening \t\tthem up with steroids? It's called \t\tevolution, Doctor. Survival of the \t\tfittest.  \tFrost stares at Karen with an intense, uncompromising gaze.  \n[68]\t\tI have a wake-up call for the human \t\trace. You're no longer at the top of \t\tthe food chain.  \n[69] \tAn ALARM is ringing. Sunlight streams in through the broken window. \tTWO VAMPIRE GUARDS who have been caught in the sudden swath of light \tare burning up before our eyes. Blade climbs to his feet --  \n[70] \tThe vampire tumbles earthward, SCREAMING as the sun's rays ignite his \tbody, falling like a human comet.  \n[71] \tBlade unsheathes his sword and heads out into the hall --  \n[72] \tTo Blade's right is the inner chamber with the \"waterfall\" walls. As \tANOTHER VAMPIRE approaches, Blade readies his sword --  \n[73] \tWe are in a windowless, vault-like room dominated by a series of \thigh-tech STAINLESS STEEL SARCOPHAGI. Think of a hyperbaric coffin, \teach unit possessing a small face-plate window through which the \tsleeping subject can be viewed.  \tBlade unsheathes his sword. He grabs the lid of the first \tsarcophagus, HEAVING upward. With a PNEUMATIC HISS, the lid rises, \tbelching out a cloud of condensation mist.  \tAs the mist clears, revealing the occupant within, Blade raises his \tsword, ready to plunge it downward -- only it's not Deacon Frost who \trests beneath him, it's --  \n[74]\t\tShe can't. She's one of my thralls \t\tnow. She has about as much free will \t\tas a puppet on a string. \t\t\t \t\tYou love me, don't you, Vanessa?  \n[75]\t\tWhat do we have here? Your precious \t\tserum? I don't think you'll be needing \t\tthis anymore.  \tFrost crushes the vial in his fist. Blade struggles to reach Frost, \tstretching a palsied hand upwards --  \n[76]\t\tDon't look so surprised, Blade. You've \t\tspent your life looking for the \t\tvampire who fathered you. Well you can \t\trest easy now, you've found him. \t\t\t \t\tDaddy's here.  \tBlade's eyes widen in shock. Frost simply laughs.  \n[77]\t\tIt's true, Blade. You've got my blood \t\trunning through your veins. \t\t\t \t\tThirty years ago. A moonlit street, a \t\twoman on her way home alone. You were \t\tconceived the night I tore my fangs \t\tinto your mother's flesh.  \tFrost swings his fist into Blade's skull. Everything goes black.  \n[78]\t\tWelcome home, children.  \n[79]\t\tOn its surface, this building houses \t\tone of the city's oldest financial \t\tinstitutions -- and for over \t\ttwo-hundred years its served our \t\tcorporate needs. Look beneath the \t\tsurface, however, and you'll discover \t\tanother truth entirely --  \tThe elevator CHIMES, having arrived at its destination. The doors \tHISS open, revealing  \n[80]\t\tAs above, so below.  \tTorches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber \tglow. Frost takes in the beauty of the place.  \n[81]\t\tWelcome to our hall of ancients, \t\tDoctor. We call it the Temple of \t\tNight.  \tBlade and Karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone \taltar rises up from a dais. Blade is roughly thrown to the ground. He \tkneels there, eyes cast downward. Broken. His system being assaulted \tby the devastating effects of the Thirst.  \tQuinn and Mercury pick their way through Blade's discarded gear. \tQuinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it.  \tFrost turns to Mercury, who's been holding Blade's scabbarded sword.  \n[82]\t\tLet's see this sword of his.  \tMercury draws the sword, handing it to Frost. He sights down the \tlength of it, testing its weight. With a flick of his wrist, he \tlashes out, slashing Blade's cheek open.  \n[83]\t\tStill quite sharp, I see.  \tBlade feebly struggles to rise. Frost clubs him on the back of the \tneck with the sword pommel. Blade crumples. Karen tries to pull free, \tbut Quinn holds her tight.  \n[84]\t\tYou're wasting your breath, woman. He \t\tcan't hear you now. It's the Thirst, \t\tyou see? It already has him in its \t\tgrip.  \tFrost reaches down, dragging Blade's head up by his hair. Karen \twatches on as Frost continues to taunt him.  \n[85]\t\tHow long has it been since you had \t\tyour serum? Twelve hours? More? You \t\tmust be quite thirsty by now.  \tHe crouches down so he's eye to eye with Blade.  \n[86]\t\tWhat does it feel like? Is your blood \t\ton fire? Are you burning up inside? \t\tGive in to the Thirst, Blade. Embrace \t\tyour true nature.  \tBlade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin \twithdrawal.  \n[87]\t\tI've got news for you, Blade. We're \t\talready here.  \tFrost turns to the others, motioning.  \n[88]\t\tTake him to the sanctuary. It's time \t\the was bled.  \tThe other vampires retreat, dragging Blade along with them. Karen is \tleft alone with Frost and Quinn.  \n[89]\t\tI'd let you watch the proceedings, \t\tDoctor, but I'm afraid that privilege \t\tis reserved for members of my own \t\trace. Don't worry, though, I've made \t\talternate arrangements for you.  \tFrost motions and Quinn drags Karen towards --  \n[90]\t\tWe call this the Bone Pit. It's where \t\twe keep our mistakes, the ones who \t\tcouldn't successfully make the \t\ttransition from human to vampire.  \tFrost reaches out, caressing Karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh \tbeneath her chin with a razored fingernail.  \n[91]\t\tThey'll feed on anything, given the \t\tchance -- animals, corpses, even other \t\tvampires.  \tFrost nods. Karen struggles against Quinn, but it's no good. In a \tmanner of seconds, she's falling --  \n[92]\t\tOf course, a strapping young woman \t\tlike yourself -- well I think you just \t\tmight be considered finger food.  \tAnd with that, he's gone, stepping away from the pit.  \n[93] \tapproaches, still carrying Blade's sword.  \n[94]\t\tIt's been a long road, hasn't it? Such \t\ta pity Whistler led you so far astray.  \tFrost cocks his head to the side, studying Blade's face.  \n[95]\t\tI don't blame you, though. I want you \t\tto know that. Even after all you've \t\tdone. I understand, Blade, I really \t\tdo. It's the human side of you which \t\thas corrupted your reasoning, made you \t\tweak. But we'll take care of that, \t\twon't we?  \tBlade struggles to lift his head, forcing himself to match Frost's \tgaze, shaking with hatred.  \n[96]\t\tNo you wouldn't. I'm going to bleed \t\tyou dry, Blade. All the poison that \t\tmakes you human. \t\t\t \t\tWhen the Tide comes, you'll be begging \t\tme put you through the Change.  \tFrost lifts up Blade's sword, methodically slitting Blade's wrists \tone by one. He makes the cuts lengthwise, opening up the cephalic and \tbasilic veins with surgical precision.  \tBlood wells up from the fresh wounds, running down Blade's forearms, \tcollecting in a cistern beneath his feet.  \tFrost watches the steady, inexorable process, then nods, satisfied. \tHe looks to the others who are gathered behind him, watching on with \tsilent reverence.  \n[97]\t\tIt's done. We should ready ourselves \t\tfor the ritual of invocation.  \tFrost leads Mercury, Quinn, and the others from the sanctuary.  \tBlade struggles futilely against his bonds, crying out in \tfrustration, his body eventually sagging from exhaustion.  \n[98] \tstands in the center of the chamber, allowing Vanessa to clothe him \tin ceremonial regalia -- gleaming, centuries-old armor. He pauses, \tkissing her hungrily.  \tHaving finished suiting up, he turns to face the vampires who have \tbeen faithful to his cause -- Mercury, Quinn, a host of others. A \thush settles upon them. There's an excitement in the air, a sense \tthat something remarkable is about to happen.  \n[99]\t\tTonight is the night we've waited our \t\tentire lives for. Tonight, the \t\tblood-dimmed Tide is loosed upon the \t\tworld. Tonight, the Age of Man comes \t\tto an end.  \tThe vampires bellow out a CHORUS OF CHEERS, their voices resonating \toff the stone walls like thunder.  \n[100]\t\t\t \t\t\"And what rough beast, its hour come \t\tround at last, slouches towards \t\tBethlehem to be born?\"  \tFrost lifts the chalice to his lips and begins to drink.  \n[101] \tstands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes. \tAs he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an \tawesome, inner fire.  \n[102]\t\tNo longer.  \n[103]\t\t\t \t\tTake him.  \tQuinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger. \tHe offers his second \"new hand\" up for view.  \n[104]\t\tEnough!!!  \tBlade turns to face --  \n[105] \twho's advancing, clutching Blade's own sword in his hand. He thrusts \tthe sword forward --  \tBlade presses the grip-trigger on his punching dagger -CHING!- the \ttwo side blades spread out. We hear the RASP and CLANG of metal on \tmetal as Blade manages to trap the sword-point between two of the \tdagger blades --  \tFor a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together, \tthen, Frost forces Blade backwards --  \tWhat happens next is the most blindingly-fast sword fight ever \texposed to celluloid. Both men, fueled by super-human speed, lunge \tand spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves.  \tFrost lands a powerful blow on Blade's shoulder, the sword-edge \tbiting deep into the flesh. Blade SCREAMS. Frost withdraws the sword \tfor another strike --  \t-- until Blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing Frost's left arm \toff at the shoulder --  \tThe severed arm releases Blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! To \tFrost and Blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid-air, bleeding \tred, quivering like zero-G liquid, then SLURPING back to Frost's arm- \tstump to re-attach itself!  \tUndaunted, Blade slices the punching dagger into Frost's mid-section, \tmeeting only liquid-like resistance. The moment Blade withdraws his \tdagger, Frost's flesh seals itself up again.  \tBlade hesitates now, uncertain -- and Frost laughs, understanding \twhat has happened.  \n[106]\t\tYou're too late, Blade. I'm already \t\tchanging. Don't you see? The Sleeper \t\thas awakened. I'm not just Frost \t\tanymore. I'm becoming a god now, \t\tblood incarnate.  \tEven as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph, \tbleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't \twalk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of \tanimated blood! A blood demon.  \n[107] \twho towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid- \tlike form.  \n[108]\t\tYou can't hurt me anymore.  \tWHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING \tWITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --  \t-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the \tblink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying \tbehind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --  \tOnce again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a \tseries of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back \tagain in a series of split-second transformations.  \tBlade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --  \tWHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million \tzero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to \tpin-point his foe's next manifestation.  \n[109]\t\tEverywhere.  \n[110]\t\tYou want my blood so much?! Take it!  \tFrost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts \tof blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist \taround Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's \thead in a bubble of blood.  \tBlade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he \tcould dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!  \n[111] \tBlade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles \tstream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask \tof insanity.  \n[112]\t\tI was wrong about you, Blade. You were \t\tnever one of us. You're a traitor to \t\tyour race.  \n[113]\t\tYou're wrong -- a few minutes more, and \t\tmy transition will be complete. Even \t\tyour sword won't be able to affect me \t\tthen.  \n[114]\t\t\t \t\tJust as I thought. Still chained to \t\tyour mother's breast after all these \t\tyears.  \tIn the same instant, Vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic, \tyouthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.  \n[115]\t\t\t \t\tYou're too human, Blade.  ", "Blade": "\n[1]----- \n[2] \tcleaving the darkness, radiant light slicing across gleaming Damascus \tsteel. Words acid-etched in the weapon's fine-tempered surface:  \n[3] \tMain credits end.  \n[4] \tA gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers \tstare back. Nuclear silence. And then --  \tAll hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving \tat superhuman speed, practically a blur --  \tBlade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --  \n[5]\t\tWhere is Deacon Frost?  \tQuinn glares, trying to speak, gagging on the stake still lodged in \this trachea --  \n[6]\t\tGot something in your throat.  \tBlade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through \this ruined larynx.  \n[7]\t\tFrost.  \tQuinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade \tsees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips \ta white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness --  \n[8] \tstanding at the entrance to the morgue, a streetsweeper auto-shotgun \tin hand, sizing Quinn up.  \n[9]\t\tNow don't we look dapper?  \tQuinn BELLOWS with rage, ripping one of the heavy steel refrigeration \tdoors from its hinges, flinging it at Blade like it was lawn \tfurniture --  \tBlade rolls to the side as the door CRASHES against the wall. Quinn \truns, moving through the morgue like a human tornado, heading for the \twindows at the end of the room --  \tSMASH!!! Out goes Quinn, taking half the wall with him. Blade rushes \tto the decimated window, looks down --  \n[10] \tQuinn lands on the roof of an ambulance parked four stories below, \tcaving it in. He springs off, loping across the tarmac on three \tlimbs, then -SCREECH!-THWUMP!- rolling up onto the hood of an \toncoming car, before disappearing into the night --  \n[11] \tBlade sets Karen down in the passenger seat, climbs behind the wheel, \tkeys the ignition. The engine ROARS to life, belching fumes through \tthe dual exhaust. Blade floors it, burning serious rubber as the Olds \tvanishes from sight.  \n[12] \tBlade glances at Karen, cursing himself for giving into his emotions. \tHe hits a remote secured to the sun visor --  \n[13] \tA gate grinds open.  \tWe follow the Olds as it cruises around the back of the building, \theading down a concrete loading ramp. At the bottom of the ramp, a \theavy iron door rises. Blade's Olds disappears into the darkness.  \n[14]\t\tWhistler!  \n[15]\t\tShe's been bitten.  \n[16]\t\tShe hasn't turned yet. \t\t\t \t\tYou can help her.  \tBlade and Whistler stare each other down. Finally, Whistler turns and \theads over to the operating theater.  \n[17] \tuncomfortable playing the roll of nursemaid. He'd like nothing more \tthan to be done with this, but the only thing he can do is hold Karen \twhile she rides out the seizures.  \n[18] \tON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a \tlittle shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room, \tlike a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and \tdaggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre- \tlooking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --  \n[19] \thanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches \tit. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt \tby a tarnished chain. She reaches for it, opens it --  \tThe locket features a photo, old and faded. It's the black woman we \tsaw in the prologue, Vanessa, standing in the sunshine.  \tKaren moves towards the door, cautious --  \n[20] \tstrapped into some kind of Inquisition-esque restraint chair. His \tshirt is off, his body slick with sweat. Whistler finishes strapping \tBlade in, then stands back, holding up a gas-powered pistol injector, \thesitant --  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tJust do it, old man.  \tWhistler nods, fitting Blade with a bite guard. Then he presses the \tpistol-injector against Blade's carotid artery.  \tBlade shakes violently, grinding his teeth through the bite guard, \tveins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it \ttightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his \tcredit, Whistler never lets go.  \tMentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs \tits violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly \tprivate in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire \thunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints, \texhausted.  \n[22] \twho now blocks the exit, sword in hand. Karen retreats a step, \twary --  \n[23]\t\tYou shouldn't be here.  \n[24]\t\t-- he's a vampire.  \n[25]\t\tStupidity.  \n[26]\t\tIt's not worth the risk. We can't \t\ttrust her.  \n[27]\t\tBecause you're tainted. The venom's \t\tstill inside you. You could still \t\tturn on us.  \n[28]\t\tThen I have to take you out, just \t\tlike any other bloodsucker.  \tBlade turns and exits. Whistler and Karen follow.  \n[29]\t\tWe hunt them, moving from one city to \t\tthe next, tracking their migrations. \t\tThey're hard to kill. They tend to \t\tregenerate.  \tCLACK! Blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his \tnext weapon --  \n[30]\t\tI don't care what you believe. I \t\tsaved your life once, I don't plan on \t\tmaking a habit of it. You want my \t\tadvice, you'll be out of the city by \t\tnightfall. If you're stupid enough to \t\tstay, that's your business.  \n[31]\t\tNot anymore. You've seen one of them. \t\tYou won't be allowed to live after \t\tthat.  \tKaren stares at Blade. Whistler gestures to the windows --  \n[32]\t\tDo it. You'll be dead before you can \t\tfile the complaint.  \n[33]\t\tGet in. You\u0092re leaving.  \n[34] \tBlade brings the car to a stop. Karen looks at him. His eyes are \thidden behind his glasses, his expression stone.  \n[35]\t\tRemember what we said. Keep your eyes \t\topen. They're everywhere.  \n[36]\t\tYou okay?  \tKaren nods, glances at Gideon --  \n[37]\t\tFigured they'd send someone after you. \t\tThought I'd wait around and see who \t\tshowed up.  \n[38]\t\tIt worked, didn't it?  \n[39]\t\tHe didn't. Get over it.  \tBlade kneels next to Gideon. He turns the man's head, inspects the \tneck, the skin behind the ear --  \n[40]\t\tHe's a familiar. A human who works for \t\tthe vampires. See this mark?  \tBlade pushes aside Gideon's hair, revealing a tiny, cryptic symbol \ttattooed into the man's scalp.  \n[41]\t\tThat's a glyph, kind of like a vampire \t\tcattle brand. That means Officer \t\tFriendly here is someone's property. \t\tAny of the other vampire's try to \t\tbleed him, they'll have to answer to \t\tFriendly's owner -- \t\t\t \t\tThis glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. \t\tWe've been tracking him for a while \t\tnow --  \n[42]\t\tBecause they're vampire wanna-bes. If \t\tthey're loyal, if they prove \t\tthemselves, then their masters will \t\tturn them.  \n[43]\t\tFor some. Live forever, never get old. \t\tThe ultimate high.  \tJust then, Gideon MOANS. Blade drags the man up so they're eye to \teye.  \n[44]\t\tHow 'bout you, Officer? You a good \t\tlittle bloodhound?  \n[45]\t\tLooks like our friend was \t\tblood-running. \t\t\t \t\tWhere were you headed?  \tGideon mumbles through a split lip and chipped teeth --  \n[46]\t\tPreventive medicine.  \tKaren steps in front of Blade, shielding Gideon.  \n[47]\t\tIt's war, now get the fuck out of the \t\tway!  \tKaren grabs Blade's arm, wrestling with him, trying to push his hand \taway. As the two of them struggle, Gideon makes a break for it, \tstumbling across the lawn. Blade pushes Karen aside, takes aim, \n[48]\t\tGod-damnit!!! Do you have any idea \t\twhat you just did?! He'll warn them. \t\tThey'll be waiting!  \tBut Karen's defiant, she's not backing down.  \n[49] \taren't human, nor are they vampire. They're something else -- emerald \tgreen, laced with swirling flecks of red.  \n[50]\t\tLet me set you straight on something, \t\tDoctor. What you've \"seen\" so far is \t\tnothing. The world you live in's just \t\tthe sugar-coated topping. There's \t\tanother world beneath it, the real \t\tworld -- and it's a fucking bloodbath. \t\tIf you want to survive in it, you'd \t\tbetter pull your head out of your ass.  \tBlade slips his glasses back on, leaving Karen shocked into silence. \tHe heads for his Olds without looking back, climbs in, guns the \tengine. In seconds, he's gone, tearing off down the street in a cloud \tof exhaust.  \n[51]\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?! I could \t\thave killed you!  \tBlade lowers his sword. Karen remembers to breathe. She slumps, \ttracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with \ther body.  \n[52]\t\tDo you have a death wish or are you \t\tjust stupid?  \tKaren pushes away from the wall, angry --  \n[53]\t\tThere is no cure.  \n[54]\t\t\t \t\tWhat do you see here?  \n[55]\t\tLook closer.  \tBlade indicates a design amongst the various gang-banger tags that \tlooks something like a post-modern hieroglyphic.  \n[56]\t\tThis isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire \t\tmarking. It means there's a safe-house \t\tnearby. \t\tA place they can go if dawn is coming.  \tBlade points to a building across the street --  \n[57]\t\tOwned by vampires. There's one of \t\tthese in every major city, and just \t\tlike Domino's, they always deliver. \t\t\t \t\tYou telling me you're ready to walk \t\tthrough that door?  \tKaren nods. Blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure -- \tthere's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a \tfighter -- and Blade recognizes it.  \n[58]\t\tAll right, then, listen up, Vampire \t\tAnatomy 101. Crosses and running water \t\tdon't do dick, so forget what you've \t\tseen in the movies.  \tBlade enumerates the following on his fingers:  \n[59]\t\tYou use the stake, silver, or \t\tsunlight, got it?  \tBlade holds up one of his Casulls.  \n[60]\t\tKnow how to use one of these?  \tKaren takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.  \n[61]\t\tSafety's off, round's already \t\tchambered -- \t\t\t \t\tSilver hollow-points filled with \t\tgarlic. You aim for the heart or the \t\thead, anything else is a one-way \t\tticket to a pine box.  \tBlade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the \tclinic. Karen follows --  \n[62]\t\tGet out. Now.  \tThe POTENTIAL DONORS scramble for the exit. Behind the counter, \tTANAKA, a male nurse, reaches for an alarm button. Blade vaults over \tthe counter, aiming his rifle.  \n[63]\t\tI know you're blood-running. Who's \t\tyour sponsor?  \n[64]\t\tWhat's this? A birthmark?  \tBlade grips Tanaka by his collar, shoving him through a doorway --  \n[65]\t\t\t \t\tStill think we might be wrong? \t\t\t \t\tHow much are you shipping?  \n[66]\t\tI've got a message for your masters -- \t\tthe night's no longer safe for their \t\tkind.  \tBlade pulls back his rifle, leaving a red indentation mark where the \tend of the rifle barrel pressed into Tanaka's skin. He starts towards \tthe exit. Karen follows.  \n[67] \tBlade and Karen return to the Olds. He keys the ignition, lets the \tengine idle. They're parked down the street from the blood clinic. \tKaren looks to Blade, confused --  \n[68]\t\tHe will.  \tBlade points --  \n[69] \tBlade kills the engine, studying The Black Pearl.  \n[70]\t\tLooks like we hit pay-dirt. This place \t\tis crawling with them. \t\t\t \t\tSee the valets over there? They're \t\tvampires. So is the doorman.  \n[71]\t\tThe way they move, they way they \t\tsmell --  \tBlade continues to scan the area, pointing out a few more likely \tcandidates --  \n[72]\t\tThe whore on the corner, she's one \t\ttoo. So are the two men standing under \t\tthe streetlight.  \tBlade reaches into the back seat, retrieves his sword and a satchel. \tHe snaps open his shotgun, loads it. Karen continues to study the \tvampires Blade identified.  \n[73]\t\tThere are worse things than vampires \t\tout there.  \n[74]\t\t\t \t\tLike me.  \tBlade reaches for the door --  \n[75]\t\tWhere's the entrance?!  \n[76]\t\tI got news for you, butt-boy. You're \t\talready dead.  \n[77] \tWe see Tanaka behind him, pulling a handgun out of a desk drawer, \tswinging it up --  \tBlade unholsters one of his Casulls faster than any gunslinger in \thistory. He FIRES over his own shoulder, BLOWING Tanaka back against \tthe wall.  \tBlade puts his sunglasses back on, motions to the elevator, then nods \tto Karen --  \n[78]\t\tAfter you.  \n[79]\t\tSome kind of archive --  \n[80]\t\tYou've been watching too much TV. \t\tThey've got their claws sunk into \t\teverything -- finance, real estate, \t\tpolitics. Probably own half of \t\tDowntown.  \tBlade pulls a CD-ROM from the shelves, its spine labeled in \tindecipherable vampire glyphs.  \n[81]\t\tThis must be where they keep their \t\trecords --  \tHe pauses, hearing a DISTANT WHISPER. Blade signals quiet, silently \tleading Karen through the stacks towards --  \n[82]\t\tFrost?  \n[83]\t\t\t \t\tDon't be. You're another notch on my \t\tsword hilt, nothing else.  \tFrost's DEEP LAUGHTER drifts from the speakerphone.  \n[84]\t\tA sun lamp. We're gonna play twenty \t\tquestions. Depending on your answers, \t\tyou might get to have yourself a \t\ttanning session.  \tBlade looks to Pearl's monitor and SEES a digitized image, the SAME \tMANUSCRIPT Deacon had been studying earlier.  \n[85]\t\tWhat were you in such a big hurry to \t\tdelete just now?  \tPearl hesitates. Blade turns on the lamp. Pearl HOWLS as the harsh \tlight falls upon him. Blade flicks the light off.  \tPearl cringes, GROWLING, his face smoking profusely. Exposure to the \tUV rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a \tplague victim's.  \n[86]\t\tAnd who is LaMagra?  \tPearl hesitates again -- Blade turns on the lamp for a longer time. \tPearl thrashes, covering his face. His hands blacken, the skin \tsizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. Karen has to avert \ther gaze --  \tBlade turns off the lamp. Pearl SNARLS, his body quivering with \tpoisonous rage.  \n[87]\t\tWhere's the original, Pearl? You must \t\thave it around here somewhere.  \tPearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug-like lips quivering.  \n[88]\t\tIf he moves, cook him.  \tBlade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. He \tpulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the \tdoor, arming it with a BEEP!  \n[89]\t\tThat's the point.  \tEnraged, Pearl LUNGES from his bed. Karen triggers the UV rig, flash- \tfrying him to a blackened crisp. Pearl quivers, his enormous body \tsmoking like a piece of charred meat.  \tBlade looks back at Karen with newfound respect. She shrugs.  \n[90]\t\tI'm expecting some company.  \tIt's then that Quinn notices the micro ear-coil radio receiver in \tBlade's ear. As we MOVE IN on it, we hear a tiny VOICE squawking from \tit:  \n[91]\t\tHe can take care of himself! GO!!!  \tThey race through the twisting warren of tunnels, taking one turn \tafter another, the vampires hot on their heels --  \n[92]\t\tNothing that won't heal by dawn.  \tBlade reaches into his jacket and pulls out the small, gas-powered \tpistol-injector we saw Whistler inject him with earlier. He tries to \tload one of the ampoules into it, but because of his wounds, he's not \thaving much luck --  \n[93]\t\t\t \t\tI need help with this --  \tKaren nods, inserting the ampoule into the gun. Blade shrugs off his \tjacket, holds out his arm. Karen pauses --  \n[94]\t\t\t \t\tSerum -- it's a human hemoglobin \t\tsubstitute.  \tKaren locates a vein, presses the injector against it -- Blade \ttenses, grits his teeth, fights to keep his body thrashing as the \tserum enters his bloodstream. He grips the wall behind him -- \tactually digs his nails into the metal surface -- the agony he's \tgoing through is excruciating, like nothing we could imagine.  \tWhen it's over, he slumps forward, spent, vulnerable, flushed with \tsweat. Karen stares at him --  \n[95]\t\tNot quite. I'm a hybrid. Half-human, \t\thalf-vampire.  \tOff Karen's surprised reaction, we --  \n[96]\t\tDon't even start, old man.  \tBlade throws his sword aside, then moves off into the shadows, \tdisappearing beyond the curtains. Karen looks to Whistler --  \n[97] \tKaren enters. It's dark, just a trace of moonlight.  \n[98]\t\tYou get used to the darkness.  \tKaren takes a step towards him.  \n[99]\t\tI can't close my eyes without hearing \t\ther scream.  \n[100]\t\tI do. I remember from day one. People \t\tstaring at me, sensing I was \t\tdifferent. Watching the fear grow in \t\ttheir eyes, knowing in their hearts I \t\twasn't human.  \n[101]\t\tJust get out of here.  \n[102]\t\tI said, GET OUT!!!  \tKaren backs away, startled by Blade's vehemence. She exits, leaving \thim alone with his demons. He holds up one of his empty serum \tampoules, crushing it in his fist.  \n[103]\t\tChina Town. I need more serum. \t\t\t \t\tWhat's all this?  \n[104]\t\t\t \t\tFor your miracle cure?  \n[105] \tVampire blood cells swirling about.  \tKaren injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells -- \tthe reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins \tviolently bubbling.  \tBlade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the \tblood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which \tbursts apart the glass lens of the scope.  \tWhistler laughs, thrilled with the results.  \n[106]\t\tCancer.  \tKaren watches as Blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. She fills \tthe first, then inserts another.  \n[107]\t\tWe've got a good arrangement, that's \t\tall. Whistler makes the weapons, I use \t\tthem, the vampires die -- end of \t\tstory.  \tKaren finishes. Blade rolls up his sleeve.  \n[108]\t\tYour mother sounds like a Hallmark \t\tgreeting card.  \tBlade slips his Casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his \tleather jacket, donning his sunglasses.  \n[109]\t\tI'd wish you luck, Doc, but I never \t\tput much stock in optimism.  \tHe heads towards the elevator.  \n[110] \tEven though the streets are crowded, the people seem to make way for \thim, avoiding eye-contact.  \tBlade turns into a dark alley, ducking into the doorway of a hole-in- \tthe-wall herbalist shop.  \n[111]\t\tHow's it going, Kam?  \n[112]\t\tI was in the neighborhood.  \tKam sets his fruit bowl aside, leads Blade through a curtain into a \tback room.  \n[113]\t\tWhistler says I'm building up a \t\tresistance to it.  \n[114]\t\tMaybe it's time to start exploring \t\tother alternatives.  \n[115]\t\tYeah. I know.  \tBlade closes the valise and tucks it inside his jacket.  \n[116]\t\tThanks, Kam. \t\t\t \t\tOne other thing. Have you ever heard \t\tof a vampire called the Sleeper?  \tKam shakes his head. Blade pulls out the parchment he took from \tPearl.  \n[117]\t\tI found this in there archives. I need \t\tto find someone who can read their \t\tlanguage.  \tKam studies the parchment.  \n[118]\t\t\t \t\tHow can you be out here?  \n[119]\t\tI don't buy it.  \n[120]\t\tMaybe I don't see it that way.  \n[121]\t\tYou're wrong.  \n[122]\t\tPass.  \n[123]\t\tYou're not going anywhere.  \n[124]\t\tAny progress?  \n[125]\t\tYou don't look so good.  \n[126]\t\tIt's started.  \tKaren spins, startled. Blade stands behind her. He grips her jaw, \tturning her head so he can better view the wound.  \n[127]\t\tYou've got another day or two at most.  \tKaren nods, shaken. As she moves to leave, Blade reaches for her arm, \tstopping her.  \n[128]\t\tFor what it's worth, I'm sorry.  \n[129]\t\tI'm here to see Miracia. Kam sent me.  \tThe man turns to his fellow squatters, WHISPERING. After a heated \tdebate, a GAUNT WOMAN steps forward, motioning --  \n[130]\t\tYou're blind --  \n[131]\t\tI didn't come here to get my palms \t\tread. I need something translated.  \n[132]\t\tWho is LaMagra?  \n[133]\t\tHis blood -- ?  \tThe old woman nods, reaching for a smoldering cigarette.  \n[134]\t\t\t \t\t\"The Blood Tide\".  \n[135]\t\tHow do I stop it?  \tMiracia shrugs, spreading her hands.  \n[136]\t\tBut I just got here --  \n[137]\n[138]\t\tJesus, Whistler, what did they do to \t\tyou?  \tWhistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak --  \n[139]\t\tDon't try to talk --  \n[140]\t\tNo, we can treat the wounds --  \tBut Whistler is shaking his hand.  \n[141]\t\tWhistler, I can't.  \tWhistler clutches at Blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.  \n[142]\t\tWhistler, I --  \n[143] \tA telephoto view of Frost's penthouse. The windows are polarized, \tblocking out the sun's harsh rays.  \tBlade lowers a pair of binoculars. He's standing on the roof of a \tbuilding across the street. He hefts an air-launcher rifle up into \tfiring position --  \tBANG! An iron spike trailing a steel cable rockets through the air \tbetween the two buildings, sinking into the concrete facade of \tFrost's penthouse. Blade secures his end of the rope. He slips a \tpulley over the rope, grabs hold of two handles, and leaps off the \troof ledge!  \tWHOOSH! Blade slides towards Frost's penthouse, a good twenty stories \tabove street level. A second before he reaches the windows, Blade \tlets go. Momentum sends him CRASHING through in a shower of glass.  \n[144]\t\tYou should be. I've made some \t\timprovements.  \tAnd with that, Blade thrusts his blackened sword forward, right \tthrough the vampire's chest.  \tThe creature SHRIEKS and atomizes -FWOOSH!- flying apart in a fine- \tbeaded spray of blood mist.  \tUp ahead are a set of steel doors with a time-lock mechanism. Blade \tdraws a Casull, BLASTS away at the lock, then shoulders the doors \topen --  \n[145]\t\tMother -- ?!  \tVanessa rises from the sarcophagus, tears staining her cheeks.  \n[146]\t\tBut you -- died --  \n[147]\t\tFight him --  \tAs if on cue, Frost appears at Vanessa's side, wrapping a proprietary \tarm about her waist, kissing the nape of her neck. She leans into him \t-- an act of practiced intimacy.  \n[148]\t\tPlease --  \n[149]\t\t\t \t\tI've been better --  \n[150]\t\tHow long have we been driving?  \n[151]\t\t\t \t\tWe get out of this alive, maybe I'll \t\ttake that miracle cure of yours.  \tKaren doesn't respond. Instead she looks away. How in the world is \tshe supposed to tell him this?  \n[152]\t\tWhat are you talking about?  \tKaren forces herself to meet his gaze.  \n[153]\t\t-- go to hell --  \tFrost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.  \n[154] \tnow weakened to the point of collapse, is being lashed to a rack-like \tdevice by iron chains.  \tMercury and her cohorts move efficiently, quickly securing him. When \tthey are through, the rack is hoisted up into the air via a series of \twinch-driven chains.  \tWith every turn of the winch crank, the chains are drawn tighter, \tcausing Blade to CRY OUT, until at last, he is suspended in mid-air, \tspread-eagle.  \n[155]\t\tI'd kill myself -- before I turned \t\tinto something like you.  \tFrost just smiles and shakes his head.  \n[156]\t\tHow could you be a part of this?  \n[157]\t\tYou don't have to be.  \n[158]\t\tI don't believe that.  \n[159]\t\tMother!  \tVanessa pauses, looking back, smiling cruelly.  \n[160]\t\tGet out of here --  \n[161]\t\tYou don't understand. The Thirst --  \tHe clutches his stomach, experiencing phenomenal pain.  \n[162]\t\t\t \t\t-- tearing me -- apart.  \n[163]\t\tNo --  \n[164]\t\tI can't -- I won't be able to stop --  \n[165]\n[166]\t\t\t \t\tNever been better.  \n[167]\t\tFrost!!!  \tAll heads turn --  \n[168] \tstands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it, \tsomersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a \tpredatory cat.  \n[169]\t\tWho dies first?  \n[170]\t\tLet's see if you can grow a new one \t\tof these!  \tBlade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket \tsleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists \taround Quinn's throat.  \tBlade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body \tstaggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his \tpunching dagger --  \n[171]\t\tNext?  \tMercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade \tlaunches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING \tits neck --  \tMercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him --  \n[172]\t\tWhere are you?!  \tFrost's voice answers from all directions.  \n[173] \tBlade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles \tstream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask \tof insanity.  \n[174]\t\tGuess you're not quite as invulnerable \t\tas you thought.  \n[175]\t\tYou don't have a few minutes, Frost.  \tFrost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind \ther. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost \tspins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!  \tBlade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his \tmother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's \tpoisonous mace. Piteous, really.  \tFrost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit.  \n[176]\t\t\t \t\tIt's because I'm human that I can do \t\tthis.  \tFrost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --  \tBlade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through \tVanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind \tthem, SHATTERING and --  \tFrost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable \tintensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding \tball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.  \tBlade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the \tbacklash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over \thim --  \n[177] \tas he stirs. He's been blown clear across the sanctuary by the force \tof the blast, soaked to the quick by blood. He rises to his feet, \tretrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet --  \n[178] \tlies in pieces. Amidst them, we find the singed remains of the locket \t-- Vanessa's face barely recognizable beneath the grime. Blade stoops \tto pick it up.  \n[179]\t\tFor them. But for me --  \tHe lifts his face towards the rising sun, letting its warmth wash \tover his upturned face.  \n[180]\t\tI feel like it's finally beginning.  \tAnd on that note we leave them -- TWO FIGURES, silhouetted against \tthe new day.  ", "Krieger": "", "Curtis": "\n[1]\t\tJesus, that's rank --  \tCurtis turns back, makes note of the blackened stump where Quinn's \tarm used to be, the ruined throat --  \n[2]\t\tWhat's his story?  \n[3]\t\tPretty.  \n[4]\t\tThen what is it?  \n[5]\t\tWhat about the chemistry panel?  \tKaren looks to Julie, who reaches for a computer print-out.  \n[6]\t\t\t \t\tIt's not a joke. I've got the stiff \t\tsitting in the morgue right now -- \t\tlook, just come up and see him, okay? \t\tFive minutes, that's all I ask.  \n[7]\t\tThis is purely professional curiosity, \t\tKaren, I swear.  \tKaren rolls her eyes, lets loose a tired sigh.  \n[8]\t\tNo problem.  \n[9]\t\tJust the blood sample from the \t\tpericardial sac.  \tCurtis pauses, studying Quinn's disfigured face -- the features seem \tmuch less damaged now -- almost as if the corpse were healing itself.  \n[10]\t\tThat's weird --  \n[11]\t\tHe looks different now, burns are less \t\textreme, some of these wounds have \t\tclosed up --  \tCurtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn, \tshining the light into one of his eyes.  \n[12]\t\tTell me something, honestly, you ever \t\thave second thoughts about us?  \n[13]\t\tJesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart \t\there --  \tQuinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs \tinto Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier \taccess, sucking in blood like a living vacuum.  \tKaren stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.  \n[14]\t\tTell, me, Karennn -- ever have second \t\tthoughts -- about us?  \tKaren SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it \tlunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a \tpathetic approximation of a French kiss.  \tShe fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur, \tblindly swinging it upward --  \tCRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back, \tfalling to the side.  \tKaren crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and \tagain --  \tCRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it \tback until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head \thangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it \tadvances, dragging itself back up.  \tSobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a \tmakeshift dagger.  \tCurtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment, \tKaren ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --  \tCurtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split- \tsecond, his eyes widen in surprise --  \t-- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of \tcaustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees, \tGASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting \taway into burbling puddle.  \tAfter a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her \thands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The \tmortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling.  \tKaren looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs. \tShe pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds, \tworking as a makeshift piton.  \tKaren reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the \tfirst. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two \tmakeshift pitons. Again, they hold.  \tTrembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging \tsolely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she \tmanages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another \tfoot above the left.  \tIn this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out \tof the pit.  ", "Webb": "", "Quinn": "\n[1]\t\tFuck you, Day-walker, I ain't saying \t\tshit --  \n[2]\t\tYou won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's \t\trising, the Sleeper's gonna --  \tBlade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH! \tQuinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work, \tignoring the howling pyre behind him:  \tAll evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few \toily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by \tthe acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.  \tDENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade \tapproaches, he cringes back --  \n[3] \tA preliminary exploratory Y-incision has been made across the chest, \tstretching from shoulder to shoulder, then continuing on down the \tabdomen. Ribs and cartilage have been cut open to expose the heart \tand lungs.  \n[4] \trises from the table, flinging Curtis' twitching body aside. He curls \this blood-soaked lips back, baring viper-like fangs, emitting a \n[5]\t\t\t \t\t-- more -- blood --  \tKaren backs into the corpse drawers, but Quinn is upon her in a half- \tsecond, wrapping a hand about her throat. His mouth opens/morphs \tdisturbingly wide as if to swallow her head whole, caustic saliva \tdripping from his canines --  \tKaren tries to turn her head away, but Quinn's grip is vise-like. She \tfinds herself staring into his eyes -- pupils pulsing rapid-fire, \topening and closing, hypnotic --  \tAs Quinn sinks the tips of his fangs into Karen's carotid artery and \tstarts to nurse --  \tBANG!!! A load of MAHOGANY buckshot chews into Quinn's side. He HOWLS \tin pain. Another load catches him full in the face. He drops Karen. \tShe falls to the floor --  \n[6] \trising, his face torn up, smoking. WHIP PAN TO --  \n[7]\t\tCuriosity killed the cat.  \tBlade and Karen spin --  \n[8] \tMercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the \tvault.  \n[9]\t\t\t \t\tHola, amigo. Remember me?  \tKaren triggers the UV light, but Mercury ducks under it, ripping it \tfrom her hands, crushing it. In a split-second, the she-demon has her \tclaws around Karen's throat.  \tAs Blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like \tquicksilver. They drag Karen and Blade out --  \n[10]\t\tYou took my arm, Blade. But that's \t\tokay, I'm growing a new one --  \tQuinn lifts up his \"arm\". A skeletal forearm has grown from the \tstump. It's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet.  \n[11]\t\tNice, huh? Think I'll ever play the \t\tpiano again? \t\t\t \t\tYou can slice him, you can dice him, \t\tand the man just keeps on coming.  \tBlade struggles violently, but Quinn is upon him, pounding his fist \tinto Blade again and again and again -- giving him payback with \tcompounded interest. When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded --  \tBlade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a \tred hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing \this head up.  \n[12]\t\tStay with me, sweetness, I'm not \t\tthrough with you yet.  \tQuinn pulls Blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany \tstakes. He tugs one out, admiring it.  \n[13]\t\tTeak. Nice craftsmanship. \t\t\t \t\tNow here's a man who takes his job \t\tjust a little too seriously, don't you \t\tthink? \t\t\t \t\tWhich reminds me, Blade, think I owe \t\tyou one --  \tQuinn stabs the stake into Blade's shoulder. Blade CRIES OUT, tries \tto pull free. Karen, who's being held by Mercury, averts her gaze.  \n[14]\t\tActually, if you want to get \t\ttechnical, I owe you two.  \tAs Quinn reaches for another stake, Blade starts to laugh.  \n[15]\t\tWhat's so funny, bright eyes?  \n[16] \tsprings forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his \"good\" hand. The \tvampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his \tback-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --  \tTHUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it \toff at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels \tback into the darkness --  \n[17]\t\tHe took my fucking hand! Again!  \n[18]\t\tWe need to find him, tonight.  \tFrost claps a hand on Quinn's shoulder.  \n[19]\t\tWe should finish him off.  \n[20]\t\tFucking waste, if you ask me.  \tAs Mercury and Quinn exit, the CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the cistern \tbeneath Blade's feet. We follow the blood which has collected there \tas it flows into a crude drain and --  \n[21]\t\tGrew another hand for you sweetmeat -- \t\t\t \t\t-- and now I'm gonna kill you with it.  \tQuinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low \tkick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins \tbehind Quinn --  ", "Whistler": "\n[1] \tSet up in an old ironworks, the place looks like a cross between an \tauto junkyard and an armory. Equipment is strewn everywhere -- \tlathes, mills, old furnaces, gutted vehicles, an ad hoc surgical \ttheater -- all of it jerry-rigged in a brutal, oily-tech.  \tBlade climbs out of the Olds. He opens the passenger door and pulls \tKaren out, carries her in his arms.  \n[2]\t\tAre we bringing home strays now?  \n[3] \thobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed, \tbitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is \tlined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense \the could kick the living shit out of any man half his age.  \n[4]\t\tYou should've killed her, then.  \n[5]\t\tNo promises. You watch her close. She \t\tstarts to turn, you finish her off.  \tBlade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on \tan overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a \tlot of blood.  \tWhistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in \tKaren's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage \taround the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised, \tgangrenous.  \n[6]\t\tLocalized necrosis. She's borderline. \t\tAnother hour and she'd be well into \t\tthe change.  \tWhistler cracks open a smelling salt capsule and waves under Karen's \tnose. As she starts to stir --  \n[7]\t\tCan you hear me, woman?  \tKaren's eyes open wide. She's scared, disoriented --  \n[8]\t\tYou've been bitten by a vampire. We've \t\tgot to try and burn out the venom, \t\tjust like a rattlesnake bite --  \tWhistler reaches for a massive syringe filled with caustic-looking \tfluid. Karen sees the syringe, resists --  \n[9]\t\tHold her.  \tBlade forces Karen back. Whistler readies the syringe.  \n[10]\t\t\t \t\t\"Dr. Karen Jansen\". Listen close, I'm \t\tgoing to inject you with an antidote \t\tmade from allium setivum -- garlic. \t\tThis is going to hurt. A lot.  \tWhistler sinks the needle into Karen's neck and depresses the \tplunger. \"Hurt\" doesn't begin to describe what Karen experiences \tnext. Imagine undergoing childbirth while someone pumps battery acid \tthrough your veins.  \tKaren SHRIEKS, her body going into uncontrolled paroxysms. The wound \ton her neck begins to smoke as the antidote attacks the poisonous \tvampire venom.  \tKaren clutches at Blade's arms, digging her nails in. She stares up \tat him with unflinching intensity, like a child desperately searching \tfor assurance.  \n[11] \tON KAREN as she comes to. Her wounds have been bandaged. She rises, a \tlittle shaky, takes in her surroundings -- She's in a spartan room, \tlike a monk's cell. On the wall is a collection of knives and \tdaggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre- \tlooking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --  \n[12] \tWe hear VOICES now, coming from beyond a series of black-out \tcurtains. Karen pushes one aside and SEES --  \n[13]\t\tI had to increase the dose. You're \t\tbuilding up a resistance to the \t\tserum --  \n[14] \tA dusty, darkened hole of a room, no windows, just shadows, crumbling \tconcrete, rust stains, and --  \n[15]\t\tWandered off the beaten path, Doctor?  \tWhistler has entered the room from a second doorway. Karen looks from \tWhistler to Blade, trapped between them --  \n[16]\t\tMy name is Abraham Whistler. \t\t\t \t\tThis is Blade. As for our little \t\thomunculus here --  \tWhistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. The \tcreature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and \tforth like a fish after a lure.  \n[17]\t\tNot at all. You're looking at a prime \t\tspecimen of the homines nocturna.  \tWhistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount \tof sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied. \tSuddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the \tlid --  \tKaren becomes alarmed -- but then a massive ELECTRICAL JOLT shocks \tthe creature back into submission.  \n[18]\t\tIf Blade hadn't brought you here, you \t\twould've wound up like him.  \tKaren brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the \tprevious night. She looks to Blade.  \n[19]\t\t\t \t\tMaybe not. I did some checking, she's \t\ta hematologist. Knowledge like that \t\tmight come in handy.  \n[20] \tBeyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing -- \tlong shadows, amber light. Karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from \tinformation overload.  \tBlade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt -- strapping on body \tarmor, loading ammunition. He strings the tarnished locket around his \tneck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to \tinspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tSome of the old wives' tales are true \t\t-- they're severely allergic to \t\tsilver, various types of wood. Feed \t\tthem garlic and they'll go into \t\tanaphylactic shock --  \tWhistler picks up a customized rifle with a UV entry light, flicking \ton the beam.  \n[22]\t\t-- and of course there's always \t\tsunlight, ultra-violet rays.  \tKaren shakes her head, incredulous --  \n[23]\t\tThere's a war going on out there. \t\tBlade, myself, a few others -- we've \t\ttried to keep it from spilling over \t\tonto the streets. \t\t\t \t\tSometimes people like yourself get \t\tcaught in the cross-fire.  \tWhistler shrugs. As far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to \tsay. Karen is still protesting, though.  \n[24]\t\tYou're talking about a brotherhood \t\tthat predates the Catholic Church by \t\tthousands of years. Their survival \t\tdepends on their ability to blend in. \t\tChances are, you've encountered them \t\tand not even known it. On the subway, \t\tin a bar --  \tBlade slings his CAR-15 onto his shoulder, impatient. He starts \ttowards the Olds, gesturing.  \n[25]\t\tWait.  \tWhistler tosses a small metal canister to Karen.  \n[26]\t\tConsider it a parting gift. Vampire \t\tmace -- silver nitrate, essence of \t\tgarlic.  \n[27]\t\tThere is one other thing. I'd buy \t\tyourself a gun if I were you. If you \t\tstart becoming sensitive to the \t\tdaylight, if you start becoming \t\tthirsty regardless of much you've had \t\tto drink -- then I suggest you take \t\tthat gun and use it on yourself. \t\tBetter that, than the alternative.  \tKaren stares at Whistler, horrified, as we --  \n[28] \tstands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his \tcane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. He balances the \trifle against his hip like an over-the-hill gunslinger and OPENS FIRE \ton the vampires.  \tBlade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown \tfree from the vault. Seconds later, he and Karen are fleeing after \tWhistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.  \n[29]\t\tChrist, I'm too old for this. Somebody \t\tget me a goddamn wheelchair.  \tBlade leans against the tunnel wall, GRUNTING as he yanks the stake \tfrom his shoulder. He then pulls out a light-stick, snapping it, \tilluminating the area in a GREEN GLOW -- disturbing waves of \n[30]\t\tWe keep in radio contact.  \n[31]\t\tYou think I'd let him run loose \t\twithout a chaperone? Blade ferrets \t\ttheir rat-holes out, I map them. Then \t\twe blow them all to kingdom come.  \tWhistler finishes arming the explosive device. It BEEPS. He turns \tback to Blade and Karen, referring to a handheld navigation device.  \n[32]\t\tThere's a subway line due East of \t\there. We'd best make tracks.  \n[33]\t\tGo on, I'll be fine!  \tKaren hesitates, but Blade yanks her down the tunnel --  \n[34] \tThe loading elevator CLANGS to a stop. Blade throws the gate open. \tKaren helps him out. Now that they're safely back, the last of \tBlade's strength seems to dissipate.  \n[35] \tis waiting for them, sitting at a workbench.  \n[36]\t\tWhat took you so long?  \n[37]\t\tWe weren't sure we could trust you.  \tWhistler sighs, removing his glasses.  \n[38]\t\tBlade's mother was attacked by a \t\tvampire while she was pregnant. \t\tUltimately, she died, but her unborn \t\tchild lived. Unfortunately, he'd \t\tundergone certain genetic changes \t\twhile in the womb --  \tWhistler reaches for a pack of cigarettes, pulls one out. He thumbs a \tmatch, fires up. Takes a long drag --  \n[39]\t\tI found Blade when he was thirteen. \t\tHe'd been living on the streets, \t\tfeeding off the homeless. Apparently \t\tthe Thirst manifested itself at \t\tpuberty -- \t\t\t \t\tI took him for one of them at first, \t\talmost killed him, too. But then I \t\trealized what he was.  \n[40] \tWhistler studies Karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.  \n[41]\t\tBlade's unique, you know. A one in a \t\tbillion anomaly. He can withstand \t\tsunlight, garlic, even silver. But he \t\tstill has the Thirst.  \n[42]\t\tThe Thirst overcomes him, just like \t\tthe others. It's not something he can \t\tcontrol. \t\t\t \t\tThe problem is, time's running out. \t\tHis body's starting to reject the \t\tserum. And so far, all my efforts to \t\tfind a cure have ended in failure --  \n[43]\t\t\t \t\tWhich is why you're here. We could use \t\tsomeone with your experience.  \tA beat passes between them and Karen knows where she stands now. In \tfor a penny, in for a pound. Whistler reaches for Blade's sword.  \n[44]\t\tThis used to be mine, you know. It's \t\tbeen passed down through the \t\tcenturies, from one hunter to the \t\tnext --  \tWhistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. He takes \ta few practice parries -- it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in \tthe art of swordsmanship.  \n[45]\t\tHabit, mostly, just like this.  \tWhistler gestures with his cigarette. He finally stubs it out, his \twistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.  \n[46]\t\tI had a family once -- a wife, three \t\tdaughters. Then a drifter named Deacon \t\tFrost came calling one evening --  \n[47]\t\tEventually. He toyed with them first. \t\tHe made me choose, do you understand? \t\tWhich order they would die in --  \tKaren stares at Whistler, horrified.  \n[48]\t\tI didn't. He was cruel enough to let \t\tme live. \t\t\t \t\tEven gave me a souvenir to remember \t\thim by.  \tKaren nods -- it's all falling into place for her now.  \n[49]\t\t\t \t\tFrost's bodycount keeps rising, and \t\tI'm not getting any younger, am I?  \tJust then, we hear a SCREAM come from Blade's room, sounding more \tlike the cry of a beast than a man. Karen takes a step towards \tBlade's room --  \n[50]\t\tI wouldn't go in there if I were you. \t\tIt's best to leave him alone when he's \t\tlike this.  \n[51] \tKaren stands at a lab table with Whistler, preparing a number of \tblood sample vials. They are surrounded by host of new medical \tequipment -- from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond.  \tBlade emerges from his room, looks to Karen. As if by silent \tagreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. He straps on his \tbandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.  \n[52]\t\tGoing somewhere?  \n[53]\t\tShe's been making real progress, \t\tBlade. \t\t\t \t\tShow him --  \tKaren looks to Blade, who shrugs. She opens a refrigerator, removing \ta syringe filled with blue fluid.  \n[54]\t\tCan you imagine what a dash of that \t\twould do on your sword?  \tWhistler claps his hand on Karen's shoulder in approval, then limps \taway, quickly busying himself with another project. Blade moves to \tfollow, but Karen stops him --  \n[55] \tBlade enters through the loading elevator, finding Karen and Whistler \thard at work. She turns as he approaches -- SEES him back-lit by the \tsun. She looks pale, the whites of her eyes are streaked with red.  \n[56] \tCLOSE ON Karen as she moves to the grimy outer windows, watching the \tsun go down, an unmistakable look of dread creeping over her.  \n[57] \tWhistler and Karen sit at a work table. Karen is looking at a blood \tsmear slide through a microscope.  \n[58]\t\tTheir own blood can't sustain \t\themoglobin.  \n[59]\t\tHow?  \n[60]\t\tYou're serious? You actually think \t\tthis could work?  \tKaren pauses -- we can see in her expression that there's something \tshe's been holding back.  \n[61]\t\tThen we're back to square one, aren't \t\twe? Sooner or later, the Thirst always \t\twins.  \tAt that moment, the lights in the workshop flicker, then go out. \tKaren looks around the room, alarmed.  \n[62]\t\t\t \t\tI don't know, but the back-up \t\tgenerator should've kicked in.  \tA few seconds pass. The back-up generator still hasn't activated. \tWhistler moves to the window --  \n[63]\t\tUV floodlights are down too.  \tAs Whistler reaches for a flashlight we hear the sound of GLASS \tSHATTERING coming from the other end of the workshop. Whistler shines \tthe flashlight in that direction. We hear more sounds now -- water \tdraining, glass tinkling.  \tWhistler raises a finger to his lips, signaling silence. He edges \ttowards the black-out curtains, Karen falling in behind him.  \n[64] \tWhistler and Karen enter, cautious --  \n[65] \tKaren scans the shadows, eyes alert. We hear a WHISPER, then a \tteasing, childish, GIGGLE.  \tWhistler moves the flashlight in a slow circle, shining the beam over \tevery inch of the room. And just as he's about to complete his \tcircuit --  \n[66]\t\tGet it!!!  \tKaren snatches up the flashlight, chasing after it as Whistler \tstruggles to his feet --  \tKaren sweeps the flashlight around, catching only fleeting glimpses \tof the child as it darts through the workshop. She reaches a shelving \tunit where Whistler's weapons are stored, grabs one of the modified \tpistols --  \tKaren tries to draw a bead on the creature. She FIRES, misses, FIRES \tagain -- she's getting more unnerved as the seconds tick by and the \tcreature is moving closer and --  \t-- suddenly it's right in front of her, flying through the air, fangs \tbared!  \tThe child knocks Karen back against the wall. It's at her throat, \tsinking its claws into her neck. Karen chokes, forcing Whistler's \tpistol under the monstrosity's chin --  \t-- but then the creature morphs again, transforming into a beatific \tlittle cherubim of a child -- and Karen hesitates, because the child \tseems so goddamned human now and its eyes are luminous, pulsing and \thypnotic and --  \t-- suddenly Whistler reaches in from behind, YANKING the vampire \tchild's head back, FIRING a pistol into its skull. The creature \tslumps --  \tKaren cries out, disgusted, flinging the corpse away from her. As it \tcontinues to writhe --  \tTHUNK! Whistler swings his cane-rapier down on the creature, brutally \tdecapitating it. Finishing the job. Then he looks to Karen, winded.  \n[67]\t\tUnderstand this -- they are monsters. \t\tHesitate for even a moment, and you've \t\tlost.  \n[68] \tBlade steps out from the elevator into the workshop --  \tThe place has been trashed. It looks like a tornado touched down in \this absence. Blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious --  \n[69] \t-- and then he stops dead in his tracks.  \n[70] \thas been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and \tleft for dead. In response to Blade's voice, a MOAN escapes the dying \tman's lips.  \tBlade rushes to the wall, cutting Whistler down with his sword, \tgently lowering him to the floor. As he cradles the old man in his \tarms, Blade sees the primary wound -- two ragged puncture marks along \tWhistler's throat.  \n[71]\t\tFrost took her --  \tWhistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.  \n[72]\t\tListen. You have to -- finish me off. \t\tYou don't want me coming back.  \n[73]\t\tToo far gone, you know that.  \tBlade's at a complete loss.  \n[74]\t\tYes you can. Now get on with it.  \tAs much as he'd like to deny it, Blade knows that Whistler is right. \tHe pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.  \n[75]\t\t\t \t\tI know. \t\t\t \t\tJust be quick about it, will you? Do \t\tit right.  \tBlade fights back tears. With a wretched moan, he turns his head and \tdrives the stake into Whistler's chest. Whistler GASPS. Blade wraps \this arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out \tof him, rocking back and forth --  \tAfter a while, the rocking stops and Blade lays Whistler on the \tfloor. Then something catches his eye --  "}}
