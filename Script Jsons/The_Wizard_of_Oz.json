Well.... \n[3]Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all... \n[4]...is, are you a good witch, or a bad witch? \n[5]The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North. \n[6]Only bad witches are ugly. \n[7]The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East. \n[8]The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out. \n[9] \n[10] \n[11] \n[12]The Wicked Old Witch at last is dead! \n[13]That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she's worse than the other one was. \n[14]Leave her alone! \n[15]...ting the ruby slippers? \n[16]It's too late! There they.... \n[17]Keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful, or she wouldn't want them so badly! \n[18] \n[19]It's all right. You can get up --   she's gone. \n[20]It's all right. You can all get up. \n[21]Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear. \n[22]No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself! \n[23]Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you? \n[24]Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West. \n[25]It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road. \n[26]Just follow the Yellow Brick Road. \n[27]You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. \n[28]Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself. \n[29]That's all it is! \n[30]No. She had to find it out for herself. Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds! \n[31]Toto, too. \n[32]Whenever you wish. \n[33]Are you ready now? \n[34]Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times. \n[35]And think to yourself -- \"There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home.\" ", "Auntie": "\n[1]Dorothy -- Dorothy -- where are you?

Fifty-eight-- \n[3]Seventy --     Dorothy, please! \n[4]Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy! \n[5]I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry. \n[6]Oh, I hope we got them in time. \n[7]Here, here, what's all this jabber- wapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it! \n[8]I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon! \n[9]Well, don't start posing for it now. Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers. \n[10]Just fried. \n[11]It's no place for Dorothy about a pig sty! Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia! \n[12]Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing. \n[13]Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble. \n[14]How would it be if she keeps him tied up? He's really gentle -- with gentle people, that is. \n[15]Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go. \n[16]Dorothy! \n[17]Put him in the basket, Henry. \n[18]Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For twenty- three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now -- well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it! \n[19]Dorothy!   Dorothy! \n[20]Henry! Henry! I can't find Dorothy! She's somewhere out in the storm! Dorothy! \n[21]Dorothy -- Dorothy -- where are you? It's me -- it's Auntie Em. We're trying to find you. Where are you? \n[22]Dorothy.   Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling. \n[23]Yes, darling. \n[24]There, there, lie quiet now.   You just had a bad dream. \n[25]Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we -- ", "Dorothy": "\n[1]She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto. \n[2]Aunt Em!   Aunt Em! \n[3]Aunt Em! \n[4]Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She -- \n[5]Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the -- \n[6]Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day. \n[7]Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and -- \n[8]Oh -- all right. \n[9]Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat -- \n[10]I have so got brains. \n[11]Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all. \n[12]Well, gee, I try and have a heart. \n[13]This? \n[14]Oh! \n[15]Hickory! \n[16]I'm not afraid of her. \n[17]Oh! \n[18]Oh! Oh, Zeke! Help! Help me, Zeke! Get me out of here! Help! \n[19]Yes, I'm all right.   Oh -- I fell in and - - and Zeke -- \n[20]Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am! \n[21]Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna -- \n[22]No -- \n[23]Some place where there isn't any trouble. \n[24]Do you suppose there is such a place, Toto? There must be. It's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. It's far, far away -- behind the moon -- beyond the rain -- \n[25] \n[26] \n[27]Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't!    You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!   You won't let her, will you? \n[28]Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper -- \n[29]No -- \n[30]Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself! \n[31]You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him -- please! \n[32]Stop her! \n[33]Oh, don't, Uncle Henry.   Oh, Toto! Don't... \n[34]Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back!     You came back! Oh, I'm so glad! Toto! \n[35]Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away -- quick! \n[36]How did you guess? \n[37]Why -- \n[38]Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me. \n[39]Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you? \n[40]...polite!     We haven't been asked yet. \n[41]Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you. \n[42]Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me. \n[43]No, they won't - honestly. \n[44]Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe? \n[45]That's our farm! \n[46]Yes...That's Aunt Em. \n[47]That's right. What's she doing? \n[48]Oh -- \n[49]Me? \n[50]I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute. \n[51]What's she doing now? \n[52]Has it poppies on the wall....

And if we don't, Aunt Em may -- well, she may die! I know what I'll do - I'll give you to Hunk. He'll watch out for you. But we've got to hurry.

MCS -- Toto looks out from under bed -- DOROTHY o.s. \n[62]Toto -- I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. \n[63]We must be over the rainbow! \n[64]Now I -- I know we're not in Kansas. \n[65]Who, me? Why, I'm not a witch at all. I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas. \n[66]Who, Toto? \n[67]Toto's my dog. \n[68]Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. What was that? \n[69]You are! Oh, I beg your pardon! But I've never heard of a beautiful.... MCU -- Glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks -- DOROTHY o.s. \n[70]Oh.

I didn't mean to kill anybody!.... \n[74]Oh! \n[75]Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came. \n[76]The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked? \n[77]No, I'm afraid I didn't. \n[78]But, how do I start for Emerald City? \n[79]But -- what happens if I --- CS -- Glinda speaks to Dorothy o.s. in f.g. -- \n[80]My -- ! People come and go so quickly here! Follow the Yellow Brick Road. Follow the Yellow Brick Road? \n[81]Follow the Yellow Brick Road?

Wasn't he pointing the other way? \n[87]Why.... \n[88]...you did say something, didn't you? CS- The Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods - - \n[89]Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind? \n[90]How can you talk if you haven't got a.... MCU -- Scarecrow speaks to Dorothy o.s.in f.g. -- DOROTHY o.s. \n[91]Yes, I guess you're right. \n[92]Well, we haven't really met properly, have we? \n[93]How do you do? \n[94]Very well, thank you. \n[95]Oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable.

Oh!   Ohhh! \n[104]No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself. \n[105]No -- of course not. \n[106]Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one? \n[107] \n[108]Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces! \n[109]Um-hmm. \n[110]That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me. \n[111]Um-hmm. \n[112]I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now. \n[113]But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble. \n[114]I don't blame you for that. \n[115]Why, of course I will! \n[116]Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well. \n[117]To Oz? \n[118]Oh -- apples -- Oh look!   Oh.   Oh --- \n[119]Ouch! \n[120]We've been walking a long ways and I was hungry and -- Did you say....

How did you ever get like this? \n[133]Well, you're perfect now. \n[134]Oh --! \n[135] No heart?  \n[136]Oh -- \n[137]Oh -- \n[138]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right? \n[139]Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart. \n[140]And I'll keep the oil-can handy. \n[141]Oh, but he will! He must!   We've come such a long way already. \n[142]Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you? \n[143]Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me! \n[144]Oh!

CU - Tin Man looks o.s. - DOROTHY o.s. \n[150]...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble. \n[151]Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had! And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time. But I couldn't have, could I? \n[152]Still, I wish I could remember.    But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.   We know each other now, don't we? \n[153]I don't like this forest!   It's -- it's dark and creepy! \n[154]Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals? \n[155]Oh -- \n[156]Lions? \n[157]Oh!    Lions and tigers and bears! \n[158]Oh, my! \n[159] Lions and tigers and bears!  \n[160]Oh, my! \n[161] Lions and tigers and bears!  \n[162]Oh, my! \n[163] Lions and tigers and bears!  \n[164]Oh, my! \n[165] Lions and tigers and bears!      \n[166]Oh, my! \n[167]What sort of an animal is that? \n[168]Shame on you! \n[169]No, but you tried to. \n[170]It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs -- \n[171]Well, of course not. My goodness, what a fuss you're making. Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward! \n[172]I don't see why not. Why don't you come along with us? We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart. \n[173]I'm sure he could give you some courage.

We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess -- What kind of a horse is that? I've never seen a horse like that before! \n[198] \n[199]Jolly old town! \n[200]Ho -- ho --ho -- ho \n[201]It's the Witch!

Can you help me? \n[292]I have? \n[293]Well, I -- I think that it -- that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that -- if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right? \n[294]Oh.... \n[295]...Toto, too? \n[296]Oh, now? \n[297]Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true!

Say goodbye, Toto. \n[301]Yes, I'm ready now. \n[302]There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
