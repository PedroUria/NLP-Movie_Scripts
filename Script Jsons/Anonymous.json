Not mine. \n[3]So! I am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the Earl of Essex... \n[4]Don't think because I was in London, I didn't know exactly what went on here in my absence. \n[5]Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance. \n[6]Now tell me about the play. \n[7]Of course he did. But what was it about? \n[8]...And dancing asses? \n[9]  \n[10]And do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence? She adores them! Adores them! And Edward knows it. Mark my words, Robert, he has done this for a purpose. \n[11]  \n[12]Robert. \n[13] \n[14] \n[15]May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne. \n[16]Because the Queen has bade it so. My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so. \n[17]To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors. Seven to eight you shall be tutored in French by Mister Crane-- \n[18]Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Simmons. \n[19] \n[20]Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing. \n[21]This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God. \n[22]Not in this household. \n[23]King Philip of Spain sees the current Catholic revolt in Ireland as a weakness of ours. A weakness to be exploited.... \n[24]There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty. \n[25]I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty. \n[26]As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty. \n[27]I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you. \n[28]Of burning you at the stake as a heretic. Give him a foot-hold in Ireland, and-- \n[29]Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in Ireland... \n[30]Sir Robert Cecil. \n[31]He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well. \n[32]Murdered! \n[33]By your own hand! \n[34]He was doing my bidding! \n[35]Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my express-- \n[36]Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul! \n[37]You have placed me in a grave position, Edward. \n[38]I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. But... I wish something in return. \n[39]My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters... \n[40]Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses. \n[41]No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block. \n[42]  \n[43] Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he sees any more than Young Anne does.  \n[44]Where is her majesty? \n[45]   \n[46]No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly. \n[47] \n[48] \n[49]From King James of Scotland. \n[50]James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex... and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. You will reply to him. \n[51]I am dying, Robert-- We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation. \n[52]\n[53]Help me to my bed, my son. If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I. \n[54]You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. And then tell him Essex will not return from Ireland alive. \n[55]This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. But we must do one thing more... \n[56]Like Essex, Edward must be removed. \n[57]He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win... as they always have. \n[58]Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose the next King. \n[59]Are you certain? \n[60]Marry him, your grace? He is already married. \n[61]Can you? \n[62]Most of the Catholic princes of Europe wish to topple you and end your Protestant reign... The only things that stop them are the channel, and the hope that they might marry you, and thereby achieve your realm through other means. \n[63]Would you risk your throne for him? Would you risk England for him? \n[64]We must do as we have done before... You must go on Progress, somewhere isolated, accompanied by only those whom you most trust. \n[65]After the birth, I will find a suitable house for the child to be reared in. \n[66]He must never know. \n[67]I am praying. \n[68]She's on Progress. \n[69]The Queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart, Edward. If she had, she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure. \n[70]You must have known her eye would move elsewhere, Edward. It always has. You are neither the first, nor the last, of her lovers. \n[71]Go back to my daughter, Edward. She will accept you with open arms, as she always has. Behave as your great title demands you behave. Tend to your estates, your investments. And make me a grandson, an heir! \n[72]I cannot be certain, majesty, when the... relationship began. \n[73]But sometime soon after your return to Court. \n[74]They-- they haven't been very discreet, majesty. I presume he wanted you to know. To... to hurt you. \n[75]Majesty, there is more. The lady is pregnant. \n[76]Your whore gave birth last week. \n[77]The Queen has decided to release you. It seems time does indeed heal all wounds. These are her conditions for your release. One. You will not acknowledge the child. Two. You will never see the mother again. Three. You will avoid Court at all costs. Her majesty would prefer not to be reminded of you in any way ever again. \n[78]No. You have the freedom of the kingdom. Just not of the Court. Those are her terms. Here are mine. You will go back to my daughter. You will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life, and accept the responsibilities of your great title. \n[79]I don't know if the whore has even delivered the-- \n[80]The other one? Who told you? \n[81]There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the... mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead... \n[82]Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well. ", "Shakespeare": "\n[1]And whither were you riding now, signior? \n[2]O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot-house, your pig-house, or your whore-house! \n[3]Who, he, the noble there? Why, he's a gull, a fool, no salt in him i' the earth; man, he looks like a fresh salmon kept in a tub! \n[4]He sleeps with a musk-cat every night, and walks all day hang'd in perfumed chains for penance. \n[5]He has his skin tann'd in civet, to make his complexion strong, and the sweetness of his youth lasting in the sense of his sweet lady. And, sadly, the poor man's brain is lighter than his feather... \n[6]He is a good and empty puff, but he loves you well, signior. I wish you well with him. \n[7]Jonson! Wonderful dialogue! Wonderful.

A complete and-- \n[9]Is it any good? \n[10]You haven't even read it? \n[11]And you say he's a nobleman? \n[12]Powerful?   Rich?? \n[13]Ohhhh, you have to do it then, don't you? \n[14] \n[15]You know, it's actually not half bad... \n[16]  \n[17]No, not at all... I think we should keep your good name quite intact, thank you very much. \n[18]I, I... It's been... I, I, want to... thank my actors, whose great acting brought... my words... to life due to their most finest acting. Ah... Thank you. \n[19]\"Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene\" \n[20]\"From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\" Incredible!!

I'll have more money. \n[33] \n[34]I'll have my guineas, Ben. One way or another, I'll have my guineas. \n[35]   \n[36]My lord-- I- I need more money. \n[37]My expenses have, ah, aggrandized... since this all began. \n[38]And if, if your lordship doesn't agree to an increase in my, ah, fee, I shall be forced to make certain... facts public. \n[39]I am addressing the writer of Hamlet... of Juliet and her Romeo.

Ben, we should really-- \n[47]Ben-- you've had too much to drink. \n[48]You haven't got any ink. \n[49]That will be expensive-- keeping all the actors ready.

Oh, I like this... \n[54]We must close the play. Now!! \n[55]No, no, no, no. \n[56]The line won't get a laugh that way. You must accent the word sirrah-- \n[57]Ben! \n[58]Ben, please... \n[59]You came to me, Ben. You came to me! ", "Cecil": "\n[1]    \n[2]   \n[3]My lord of Southampton. Have you seen Essex? \n[4] \n[5] \n[6]  \n[7]We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope not too soon. \n[8]That is God's decision, your majesty. Not mine. \n[9]  \n[10]So! I am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the Earl of Essex... \n[11]Don't think because I was in London, I didn't know exactly what went on here in my absence. \n[12]He is an Earl, father.

For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance. \n[14]   \n[15]Now tell me about the play. \n[16]It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex insisted it be performed, just to spite me in front of Court... \n[17]Of course he did. But what was it about? \n[18]About? Some nonsense about fairies and cherubs. \n[19]...And dancing asses? \n[20]  \n[21]Father...    It was just a play... \n[22]And do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence? She adores them! Adores them! And Edward knows it. Mark my words, Robert, he has done this for a purpose. \n[23]Purpose?    What purpose? \n[24]  \n[25]Robert. \n[26]     \n[27] \n[28] \n[29]May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne. \n[30]Are you going to live here forever? \n[31]Why? \n[32]Because the Queen has bade it so.

If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors. \n[122]I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd heard. \n[123]Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain... \n[124]Majesty-- it is said that Essex has promised Phillip all of Catholic Ireland in return for... \n[125]Spain's support of Essex's claim to the throne of England... \n[126] \n[127] \n[128]My father's death has been a great loss for us all... \n[129]No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal. \n[130]You, you are the sun, majesty.   The glory of-- \n[131] \n[132] \n[133]His grace, the Earl of... Southampton, your majesty. \n[134]Majesty... You are not having doubts about James of Scotland succeeding you, are you? \n[135]    \n[136]  \n[137]  \n[138]Majesty! You must away! Essex is in armed revolt! He's come to usurp you! \n[139]You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He means to kill you and take your throne for himself! \n[140]She won't forgive him this, Edward. \n[141]Essex will be convicted and executed for treason. As will your son. \n[142]  \n[143]He hated you, Edward, how he hated you. And yet he married his only daughter to you. I never knew why, until I read his last letter to me. \n[144]No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to be a king. \n[145]Elizabeth had several children, Edward, not just yours. She was sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary was still Queen, and our future Gloriana was out of favor. No one thought her very important at all. Except my father, of course. And when her first child was born, a male, my father took it, and hid it. The grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman. John De Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task. \n[146]Do I? Why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died? He had it all planned years in advance. He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry his daughter, and, after Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir. His own grandchild to follow you on the throne. But he couldn't possibly predict what kind of failure you would become. How you would fail in politics, ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy, all to write... Poetry. Or that you would commit incest. \n[147] \n[148]What?  Slept with her son? I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth. Though you never know with the Tudors. They all have had such strange tastes in bed-fellows. You could have been a king, Edward. And your son after you. Except for the fact that... you were you. \n[149]I want a fair trial for Southampton... Evidence, witnesses, no false confessions. It must be above reproach. Though with a guilty verdict of course. Oh, and Pole-- If there is any mention of that play-- \n[150]--Make certain the secretaries refer to it as Richard the Second. There will be no mention of hunchbacks in the official record... \n[151]Majesty, I-- \n[152]   \n[153]I can make all this go away, Jonson... To be but a dream. Like one of your plays... Or, I can bring you so much pain-- pain that were you given a thousand years, and a thousand quills, you could never justly describe... \n[154]I know you have them. All his manuscripts. My sister saw you leave Oxford Stone with them under your arm. \n[155]Let him go!   He tells the truth. \n[156]And Jonson-- better him, won't you? Wipe his memory for all time. For you. And for me. \n[157]Of course, your majesty... ", "Christopher": "", "Marlowe": "\n[1]That might be so, but like a grain of wheat hid in a bushel of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find it, and when you have it, it's not worth the search! \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]Certainly not any of yours. \n[5]And why would any of you admit to trying to better me in a historical drama? Comedy, yes, tragedy, perhaps. But never will one of you best me in historicals. \n[6]Or will we be seeing a most hysterical historical? \n[7]Hmm? Ben? Waiting to see how it's received before you lay claim?? \n[8] \n[9]Precisely why I avoid them. \n[10]Not literally, of course. He was a character, a fictional character. But the metaphor was clear for anyone to see. And see, they did. \n[11]Will you shut it down? \n[12]It's difficult to write, isn't it? After watching something like \"Hamlet\"... \n[13]I've seen you watch him. Will. During a performance. It eats at you... at your soul... \n[14]Why do you think Will hasn't been arrested? You or I make the slightest joke about a nobleman of no consequence, and we find ourselves in a cell quicker than a fart spreads in the trade winds. Will-- he murders a caricature of old William Cecil himself, and still whores all the way to Westminster and back. \n[15]I made sure they did... \n[16]Watch who you judge, Ben, for as God is my witness, you may well find yourself doing the same before you meet your maker. We do what we have to, to survive, and survive well, in this life. All of us. And Will is definitely not one of us. You know he's illiterate, don't you? \n[17]No? Oh, he can read well enough-- how else could he learn his lines? But the man never actually learned to form his letters. \n[18] \n[19]It must be someone who wants their anonymity protected. Someone who might even pay to have it protected. \n[20]A nobleman. \n[21]But which?    You know, don't you, Ben? \n[22]Ben! Tell me. We can go to him together. Guarantee his anonymity... for a price. \n[23] \n[24]Ben-- I'll just go to Will! He'll tell me because he has so much more to lose than you. Fame. Fortune. And you'll profit nothing from it. Nothing!

Mio dio! Signor! What has happened-- \n[4]Have you any idea to whom you are speaking? \n[5]Out. Get out! How dare you insult my master in-- \n[6]A year? \n[7]Forgive me for speaking of things above my place or understanding, signor. But... Is this wise? They have already tried to kill you once. \n[8] \n[9] \n[10]  \n[11]A pox on Cecil! \n[12]Down with Cecil! \n[13]Up with Essex! To Essex House!     To Essex House!! \n[14]To Essex House! To Essex House! Death to Cecil! Traitor! \n[15]Signor Jonson! We are betrayed!    Run! Run! ", "Ben": "", "Jonson": "\n[1]    \n[2] GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.  He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then places the bound manuscripts in their place, then closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--  \n[3]I'm a writer, aren't I?   Of course I've bloody well been-- \n[4] \n[5]I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I know whereof you speak. I have had the honor of meeting his lordship-- \n[6] \n[7]Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And- - \n[8]  \n[9]And who are you? \n[10]And where are we going? \n[11]My lord... \n[12]It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord. \n[13]I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you. \n[14] \n[15]Thank you, my lord. \n[16]Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy-- \n[17]A play, my lord? \n[18]Stage? \n[19]My name, my lord? \n[20]Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire play, my lord. I know how difficult-- \n[21]And you want... me to apply my name to this play? \n[22]All of them? \n[23]My lord-- I really-- \n[24]My lord? \n[25]Hello?   My lord?! I-- \n[26]How in blazes should I know? \n[27]I read a line or two-- I promised Henslowe I'd finish \"Eastward Ho\" by Saturday. \n[28]I tell you Will-- I came to London to become a great poet, to, to, be the conscience of our times, the soul of our age! To change the world, not to become someone else's-- \n[29]Yes, why not? Why can't a man change the world with words? \n[30]  \n[31]Not half--?! You're an actor, what in God's name do you know about writing?! He's an amateur, Will, a complete and utter amateur. Last week gardening, this week playwrighting, next week hawking. No. I won't do it. It would be an affront against the Muses... \n[32]What, you think my name can be bought, if the number's great enough, do you? \n[33]  \n[34]My lord, I thought that-- \n[35]My lord, your voice is completely different than mine. My, my, my characters are-- \n[36] \n[37] \n[38]You can't play Romeo. \n[39]So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act. \n[40]Think you so? Have you ever tried? \n[41]  \n[42] \n[43]You informed on one of your own?   To the Tower? \n[44]Why are you here, Kit? \n[45]You've had too much to drink, Kit. You're beginning to sound like one of your plays. \n[46]You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit? Last year. That's why I was arrested, wasn't it? Because you went to the Tower? \n[47] \n[48]  \n[49]More--? You already make more than any playwright Bankside. \n[50]Your work? \n[51]Impossible. \n[52]I'll take that bet!!   Eight shillings on the bear, six dogs! \n[53] \n[54]Or what? You'll slit my throat like you did Kit's? \n[55]I know he went to see you last night, Will. And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms. \n[56]Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done. \n[57]Right!? Not without right? You went to him, didn't you? You lying knave-- you went to him! \n[58]What? You've already killed off one competitor. Now you want another dead as well? \n[59]I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his name. Swore it! Do you have any idea what he might do to me? Do you? \n[60]He's not even a writer you know. He can't even-- \n[61]Unhand me! \n[62]Here! A quill! A quill! \n[63] \n[64] \n[65]Free? \n[66]  \n[67]I... There is a-- there is a play to be performed... on Monday. \n[68]Yes, my lord, but this one is to be performed one performance, and one performance only. On Monday. All Bankside is talking of it. The History of King Richard the Third. By William Shakespeare. \n[69]He kills his brother the king, and half the royal family to get the throne for himself-- \n[70]Yes. Of course you do. But in William Shakespeare's version, he is played as a hunch-back. \n[71]Waiting?     Waiting for what? \n[72]  \n[73]This is what Essex is waiting for-- Oxford is bringing him a mob. \n[74]I don't know, I don't know! But, the Tower-- Cecil, he already knows. He knows! I-- I have to warn them! \n[75]  \n[76]   \n[77]  \n[78]Will!   Will Shakespeare! \n[79]So!    Off to the palace are you? \n[80]A command performance for our new king! Even in bloody Scotland they've heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have they? Fraud. Charlatan. Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer! \n[81]It was your husband who sent for me, madam. \n[82]Excuse me, your grace. \n[83] \n[84] \n[85]My lord? \n[86]I am not worthy of this charge, my lord. I... I betrayed you... I told them of your-- \n[87]Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper. \n[88]To the Earl of Southampton. The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. \n[89]What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted, yours. \n[90]Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship, to whom I wish long life... still lengthened with all happiness. \n[91]They were destroyed...   burned...   by your own men... \n[92]My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than I? \n[93]He was something I could never be. An undeniable perfection... that plagued my soul... And to him I was... nothing. A messenger. Nothing more. \n[94] \n[95]  ", "Robert": "\n[1]My lord of Southampton. Have you seen Essex? \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny him-- \n[5]It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex insisted it be performed, just to spite me in front of Court... \n[6]About? Some nonsense about fairies and cherubs. \n[7]Father...    It was just a play... \n[8]Purpose?    What purpose? \n[9]Are you going to live here forever? \n[10]Why? \n[11]Is that Homer? \n[12]I was also winning. \n[13] \n[14]He butchered you! \n[15]Not only in front of Court! But the entire City as well! We must arrest this Shakespeare and- \n[16]But we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks-- \n[17]I will reply to him? \n[18] \n[19] \n[20]  \n[21]A wise decision, your majesty. If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors. \n[22]I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd heard. \n[23]Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain... \n[24]Majesty-- it is said that Essex has promised Phillip all of Catholic Ireland in return for... \n[25]Spain's support of Essex's claim to the throne of England... \n[26] \n[27] \n[28]My father's death has been a great loss for us all... \n[29]No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal. \n[30]You, you are the sun, majesty.   The glory of-- \n[31] \n[32] \n[33]His grace, the Earl of... Southampton, your majesty. \n[34]  \n[35]  \n[36]Majesty! You must away! Essex is in armed revolt! He's come to usurp you! \n[37]You must flee! Quickly! Majesty! He means to kill you and take your throne for himself! \n[38]She won't forgive him this, Edward. \n[39]Essex will be convicted and executed for treason. As will your son. \n[40]  \n[41]He hated you, Edward, how he hated you. And yet he married his only daughter to you. I never knew why, until I read his last letter to me. \n[42]No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to be a king. \n[43]Elizabeth had several children, Edward, not just yours. She was sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary was still Queen, and our future Gloriana was out of favor. No one thought her very important at all. Except my father, of course. And when her first child was born, a male, my father took it, and hid it. The grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman. John De Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task. \n[44]Do I? Why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died? He had it all planned years in advance. He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry his daughter, and, after Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir. His own grandchild to follow you on the throne. But he couldn't possibly predict what kind of failure you would become. How you would fail in politics, ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy, all to write... Poetry. Or that you would commit incest. \n[45] \n[46]What?  Slept with her son? I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth. Though you never know with the Tudors. They all have had such strange tastes in bed-fellows. You could have been a king, Edward. And your son after you. Except for the fact that... you were you. \n[47]I want a fair trial for Southampton... Evidence, witnesses, no false confessions. It must be above reproach. Though with a guilty verdict of course. Oh, and Pole-- If there is any mention of that play-- \n[48]--Make certain the secretaries refer to it as Richard the Second. There will be no mention of hunchbacks in the official record... \n[49]Majesty, I-- \n[50]   \n[51]Of course, your majesty... ", "Thomas": "", "Dekker": "\n[1]Marlowe-- spot me a few pence, will you? Henslowe still owes me for \"Shoemaker's Holiday\". \n[2]Ale here! \n[3]I wonder if he needs any material? \n[4]It wasn't all in verse. \n[5]The maids love the romantic tragedies. \n[6]What in blazes is it? \n[7]I can't quite make out the motto... Non sanz... Non... \n[8]Essex!? Impossible. My cousin's one of his men-at-arms. Hasn't been paid in weeks. They're all just sitting there, waiting. \n[9]Wants to have an audience with the Queen. As if Cecil would ever let Essex near her now. \n[10] ", "Nashe": "\n[1]  \n[2]Kit... Isn't that one of your unrequited loves in the box over there? \n[3]I think-- yes, by the beard, that's the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker used to play for him. Had his own acting troupe for private Court performances and the like. \n[4]No, no-- that was years ago. Had a falling out with the Queen, I heard. He's more of a recluse than a patron these days. \n[5]\"Henry V\" by... No one? \n[6]I for one wish to see this anonymous colleague of ours. Playwright! Playwright!! \n[7]I could do it if I wanted to... \n[8] \n[9]Of course not. But I could if I wanted... \n[10]Ha!   See!   Even easier! \n[11]A fortnight? \n[12]Aw, well. No worries. A one-trick pony. He'll never be able to do it again. \n[13]It's quite... colorful. \n[14]Not without-- \n[15]So! I heard the Earl of Essex paid for this whole performance! Man's never even been to the theater, and still he's heard of Will-- \n[16]By the mass, Cecil in favor, Essex out! Who can keep up with it all!? \n[17]Zounds, I tire of politics, politics, politics. \n[18]Why is Oxford's man with the Groundlings? \n[19]Why would Oxford-- "}}
