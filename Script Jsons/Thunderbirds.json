Come on!  \n[2]The island is in sight.  \n[3]Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target the main structure?  \n[4](trying to move and realizing that he can't) This is ridiculous.  \n[5]We made land.  \n[6]Get up.  \n[7]Yes, sir.  The kids lift their heads back up into the vents  \n[8]Someone's there. (Mullion walks over to the ceiling, he is standing directly below where they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand shoots up through the ceiling and grabs Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps in pain.  The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command and Control room can hear them.  \n[9](The guards walk out of the elevator and see Tintin pointing the Firefly at them) Retreat! (They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them  \n[10]Get 'em!  \n[11]Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And set it on broil!  The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel and see the flames coming from Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel opens up and leads to the ocean.  Back in Command and Control  \n[12]Of course not, the little brats went up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! (laughs at Brains and Brains moves to punch him.  \n[13]Yes, sir. Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, they are getting knocked over by a couple of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.  \n[14]Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults.  \n[15]I didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember.   The Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps.  \n[16](Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and speaks into headset) Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics.  An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.  \n[17]What's going on?   \n[18]What's wrong with it?  \n[19]Aaargh!  \n[20]No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.  \n[21]Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.   Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter.  \n[22]Come on!  The kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river.  \n[23]There! Come on!  Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive.  \n[24]Straight ahead.  Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other two guards. Mullion falls off the car and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all three of them can fit on it.  \n[25]Go! Go!  \n[26]Come on! Faster!  \n[27](Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has him sit down on a container) Cool off, kid! (he laughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door on the way out Scene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island.   \n[28]I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do.  \n[29] You've broken my nose.  \n[30]You're coming with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady Penelope over his shoulder  \n[31]You need to cool off, milady.  \n[32]Under an hour. Bank of London, here we come!  Scene changes back to the fridge.   \n[33]ETA, one minute.  Scene switches to Lady Penelope in Thunderbird 1 talking to Parker on her cell phone.  \n[34]Look at all this gold!  \n[35]Don't move. (Parker motions for the kids to run forward but Transom blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her  \n[36]I've been waiting to get my hands on you brats.  ", "Excited": "\n[1]It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.  \n[2]In Russia, at an oil rig fire.  ", "Kid": "\n[1]It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.  \n[2]In Russia, at an oil rig fire.  \n[3]Ooh, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one day. Thunderturd!  The boys in the room \"ooohh\" and look at Alan for a response   ", "Gordon": "\n[1]Try and keep up!  \n[2]Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one!  \n[3]Check retros. Go.   \n[4]You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters on my mark. Three, two, one.  \n[5]We're locked on.  \n[6]The locking mechanism's jammed!  \n[7]We're okay.  \n[8]Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.   \n[9]Alan? He's just a kid!  ", "Tracy": "\n[1]I was just...  \n[2]Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. I have visual, south column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.  \n[3]FAB. We'll take it from here.  \n[4]Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.  \n[5]I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers?  ", "Jeff": "\n[1]FAB. We'll take it from here.  \n[2]Scott, get out. That tower's coming down.  \n[3]Thunderbird 1 any damage?  \n[4]This approach angle's no good. Gonna have to swing her around.  \n[5]Scotty, I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.   \n[6]Whoa! Hold on!  \n[7]Virgil, how's it going?  \n[8]Alright, let's haul them out.  \n[9]Okay, let's bring 'em home.  \n[10]Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go.  \n[11]How you doing, son?  \n[12]Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.   \n[13]Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home.   \n[14]Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go.  \n[15]Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5 engine out light.  \n[16]Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan at arm's length and then looks him over. He then looks over and sees his older sons approaching. Ah oh look out.  \n[17]Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.   \n[18]Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.  \n[19]Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school.  \n[20]No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?   \n[21]Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.   \n[22]Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?  \n[23]Of course.  \n[24]Any suspects?  \n[25]Tintin!  \n[26]Did you know Alan's home? \n[27]When are those two going to get along?   \n[28]What sort of thing?  \n[29]Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.  \n[30]Have a safe flight home, Penny.  \n[31](his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 1 shuts down  \n[32]You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!  \n[33]Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules. You understand? (Alan just looks at him) Do you?  \n[34]I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.  \n[35]Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.  \n[36]Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you?  \n[37]30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind? \n[38]Alan's home for spring break.  \n[39]Teenagers.  \n[40]Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need help with that fire.  \n[41]How bad, Brains?  \n[42]Meteor?  \n[43]Thunderbirds are go.  Scene change to inside Thunderbird 3.  \n[44]Go to maximum thrust.  Scene switches to the submarine.  \n[45]Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon, prepare for immediate docking.  \n[46]Easy. Watch the roll. \n[47]Nice work   \n[48]Emergency packs boys. Let's move!   \n[49]We're in. Let's go!  Jeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon are now in the damaged Thunderbird 5 with John.  \n[50]John! Scott, tackle that fire.  \n[51]Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage assessment.  Scene switch to back on the island. The kids are running through the jungle while heading toward the vents and the Hood and his crew are heading toward Command and Control.  \n[52]Attempt manual override.  \n[53]Back to Thunderbird 3 now. (turns to help an injured John) John, we gotta move.  \n[54]Okay, you have our attention. Who are you? What do you want?  \n[55]Why the Thunderbirds?  \n[56]An eye for an eye?  \n[57]Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, status report.  \n[58]Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air.   \n[59]Scott? Gordon? You all right?  \n[60]You don't say.  Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and Fermat.  \n[61]Alan, where are you? Are you safe?   \n[62]We're standing by.  \n[63]Alan, what's happening?  \n[64]That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point. Alan can you read me? (the screen begins to break up  \n[65]Alan we're losing you! Alan!  \n[66]Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's getting a little hot in here.  \n[67]Stop it!  \n[68]No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.  \n[69]He's a Tracy.  Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and then to Lady Penelope and Parker walking up to the Tracy house  \n[70]Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open.  Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and Parker.  \n[71]I think that's the first time you've ever called me by my first name, Brains. Thanks for waking me.  \n[72]Alan! Well done.  \n[73]FAB, Brains.   \n[74]Looks like we're good to go.  \n[75]We're fine. We still have a job to do. Where's The Hood? \n[76]Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.   \n[77]Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. Thunderbirds are go!  \n[78]Okay, boys, we are outta here.  \n[79]Gordon, heat 'em up.

Scene changes to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in Thunderbird 2.   \n[81]Brains, come in, what's the situation?   \n[82]Where's Thunderbird 1?  \n[83]FAB. We're right behind 'em.  Scene changes to Mullion, Transom, and the Hood in the Bank of London.  \n[84]Hey don't get cocky after one mission. We still have a dangerous situation. I need you boys to close down this accident scene. Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us at Thunderbird 1. Alan, you come with me.  \n[85]We got to get to the Bank of London fast.  \n[86]I know, she may need help.  Scene changes to The Hood inspecting a diamond at the Bank of London.  \n[87]No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan. It doesn't matter how hard you try or how brave you are. It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give your life in a second to save. You just can't save everyone.  \n[88]She was a lot like you. Come on, we've got a job to do.  Scene switches to Lady Penelope being handcuffed at the Bank of London.  \n[89]Good timing, Parker.  \n[90]Come with us.  \n[91]Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.  \n[92]Penny!  \n[93]I didn't make you what you are.  \n[94]Leave my son out of this- (the Hood uses his powers to throw Jeff into the cage that Lady Penelope is handcuffed in  \n[95]No!  \n[96]Alan!  The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the catwalk above the Mole. The scene then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into a cage.  \n[97]Alan, stay back. \n[98]Let him go.  \n[99]Let him go, please.  \n[100]Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens his hold of Alan and then releases him   \n[101]Alan, get out. Run!  \n[102]Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, no! Look out! (The Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!  \n[103]It's a Tracy secret.  \n[104]Gather around everybody. I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special night. We're all together because of three very special people. Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them International Rescue pins  \n[105]Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. You earned it. You all did.  \n[106] Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, straightaway. Boys. Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.  \n[107]Thunderbirds are go! Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat   ", "Headmaster": "\n[1]Mr. Tracy!  \n[2]Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea of boys he continues) There's someone here for you.  Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling, your father's been unexpectedly detained. And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?  ", "Virgil": "\n[1]Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.  \n[2]It's looking good, Dad.  \n[3]Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get you out of here.  \n[4]Hold on guys  \n[5]Never better  \n[6]OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here.   \n[7]Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair  \n[8]No kidding.  \n[9]Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something?  \n[10]Man, I haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.  \n[11]No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.  \n[12]Roll index angle minus two degrees.   \n[13]How long will that give us? \n[14]Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes.  \n[15]Okay let's clean it up guys.  \n[16]Hey, Scott.  \n[17](As all four of Alan's brothers walk over to ruffle his hair and congratulate him) Hey, way to go, sprout!  ", "Lady": "\n[1]Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?  All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose them. \n[2]Quite right.  \n[3]Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the open door.) Here we are.  \n[4]Try not to run over any children, Parker.   \n[5]Come on, Parker, chop chop!  Lady Penelope's begins to fly  \n[6]Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season.   \n[7]And hemlines are going up.  \n[8]Oh and apparently England won the football last night.  \n[9]Calm down, Parker.  \n[10]Now, that's showing off.  \n[11]Parker.   Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo.  \n[12]I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.  \n[13]Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.   \n[14]My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.   \n[15]Hello, Tintin.  \n[16]When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of thing.  \n[17]Romance.  \n[18]No, you wouldn't.  \n[19]Thanks, Jeff.  Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 1 like they are really about to fly it into a mission.  \n[20]Parker?  \n[21]We have an emergency.  Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom  \n[22]What a charming fellow.  Someone knocks on the door.  \n[23]Come in.  Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath.  \n[24]Have a look at this, Parker. (There is a computer monitor near her feet.) He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.   \n[25]Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when  his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. Oh, perfect, Parker. The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. Belagant's brother.  \n[26]How's my schedule, Parker?  \n[27]I suppose that's urgent.  \n[28]The Thunderbirds haven't responded?   \n[29]I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker.  \n[30]Any word?  \n[31]Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We  shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And bring the car around.  \n[32]The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go, Parker.  They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood in the Thunderbirds hanger.  \n[33]Isn't life fun, sometimes?  \n[34]This doesn't look good, Parker.  \n[35]That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about  that hideous hammock. \n[36]And I know Parker.  \n[37]One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level. sometimes it's just not possible.  Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching them.  \n[38]Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.  \n[39]Flattery will get you nowhere. (after she blocks the metal bar that Transom was trying to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days?  \n[40]That's not saying much, then, is it?  \n[41]Don't try your parlor games on me you sad, little man. You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's watch) four seconds, I'm going to get quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot which was about to come up and kick him.  \n[42]Put me down! This outfit is couture.   Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.  \n[43]Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite enough losing for one day.  \n[44]Parker, I have an idea.  \n[45]Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?  \n[46]Here we go.  \n[47]Come on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys a good thrashing!  Scene switches back to Thunderbird 2 launching Stage three.  Scene changes back to the fridge.  \n[48]I love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker.  \n[49]Will this suffice, Parker?  \n[50]I didn't actually need it, anyway.   \n[51](Using the video phone to talk with Thunderbird 5) Thunderbird 5 come in.

Now, don't move!  \n[61]That's not cricket.  \n[62]How ghastly.  Scene changes to Alan and Jeff in Thunderbird 1.  \n[63]Shame on you. I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs. (sees the look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles and walks away.  Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter the Bank of London when Parker pulls up. \n[64]Jeff!  \n[65]Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to throw Alan off to the side where he slams into a wall  \n[66]Let him go.  \n[67]Alan! Are you all right?  \n[68]What did you put in these margaritas?  \n[69]Of course it does. And quite right too.   Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms about to go on a rescue mission. The older four are looking at Alan.  \n[70]Fast as you can, Parker.  ", "Penelope": "\n[1]Fantastic.

And radar indicates we have some company.  Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind.  \n[9]Milady?  \n[10]Sounds like an alias, milady.  \n[11]Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.  \n[12]You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.  \n[13]Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta.  \n[14]No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis-\u00e0-vis their whereabouts.

(punches him and after that has no effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion  Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting Parker.  \n[25]Coming through, milady.

This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized. And it's never done any real harm before.

I can't hit a lady.  \n[41]And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.  They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch on Parker.  \n[42]Ow, now that was a punch.  \n[43]What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?   \n[44]I concur.   Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope is being held captive in  \n[45](To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the car) Now, that was definitely showing off.

Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 1 earlier.  \n[21]Look at this.  \n[22]Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound.  \n[23]Morning, Dad.  \n[24]The neural-net control system?  \n[25]Dad?  The neural-net control system short circuits.  \n[26]There's something I want to talk to you about.  \n[27]N-no!

The camera follows one rock and it leads to a telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected to the Hood's submarine.  \n[29]Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit!

Everything can be explained by science.  \n[59]My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin!

Which is now b-b-broken.  \n[71]Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.  \n[72]Perfect.  \n[73]What'd he say?  \n[74]I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat!

Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second.  \n[84]Great, more water.  \n[85]It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.  \n[86]You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else  \n[87]It's a hoversled.  \n[88] Here. \n[89]Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-s-safe.  \n[90]Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team.  \n[91]Alan! You're going too fast!  \n[92]Oh, no! Not the fridge!  Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains.  \n[93]Not b-bad, actually.  \n[94]We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk.

They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything, okay?  \n[106]Dad!  \n[107]Dad!  Alan throws the video phone  \n[108]Useless!  \n[109]No, it's okay. I'm fine.  \n[110]But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go. \n[111]Tintin, can you slow 'em down?  \n[112]Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat.  Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the junkyard.  \n[113]This'll get us out of here.  Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest.  \n[114]No problem.  \n[115]I said no problem.  \n[116]It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.  \n[117]Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught. I say we do something. Now! Right, Fermat?  \n[118]You don't think anything is s s-safe.   \n[119]Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote? Or do you want to get out of here? Cuz I'm going.  \n[120]I need more speed to get above the trees. Hang on!  Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's feet.  \n[121]What'd I tell you guys? (looks down and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) Oh, no.  Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door in the Tracy house.  \n[122]Lady P!  Scene switches to Thunderbird 5  \n[123]He's weak. Using his power makes him weak. (The Hood, having heard something looks over toward where Alan  \n[124]Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water  \n[125]So, how does it feel to be right all the time?  \n[126]I'm so sorry, Fermat. \n[127]We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting away.  \n[128]Yes!  \n[129]Okay, everyone get to the control room.   \n[130]How long have they got before re-entry?   \n[131]Good job, Fermat.  \n[132]Dad, come on are we coming through?   \n[133]Dad, come on!  \n[134]Dad!  \n[135]How long have they got?  \n[136]Dad!  \n[137]Dad, are you all right?  \n[138]He's got the Mole on board.  \n[139]Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything you've built everything the Thunderbirds stand for.  \n[140]I can do this. You know I can. What am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin and Fermat) We can do this.  \n[141]\n[142]Yep.  \n[143]You ready, Fermat?  \n[144]Right. Set primary fuel pumps. Main engine start.  \n[145]Roger, Brains.  \n[146]\n[147]I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time.   \n[148]Initiate landing, Fermat.  \n[149]Retros at 75 flaps to 16.  \n[150]Thanks. Retros to 90.  Thunderbird 1 lands.  \n[151]The Hood's getting away.  \n[152]We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is to save those people. Brains, we're going into the accident zone.  \n[153]Brains, the monorail is down. Repeat, the monorail is down. I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4. You have the bridge.  \n[154]Fermat, the Thunderbirds need you right now. I need you.  \n[155]Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three, two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail.  People are panicking in the monorail and a little girl is crying for her mommy. \n[156]Don't panic, guys.   \n[157]Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it up?  \n[158]How are we doing on that line Fermat?   \n[159]Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. (Tintin successfully connects the rope to the stanchion and swims toward Thunderbird 4's airlock) Opening the airlock.   \n[160]OK, Fermat, we need a lift.  \n[161]That was amazing, Tintin.  \n[162]Nice job, Fermat.  \n[163](To Tintin who is helping him lift the monorail out of the water with Thunderbird 4) Easy does it.  Thunderbird 3 has landed and Jeff, Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon are running over to the river bank to look for Alan in Thunderbird 4.  \n[164](After he and Tintin have gotten out of Thunderbird 4) Glad you could finally join us. \n[165]Lady Penelope went after The Hood.   \n[166]Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said, about you leaving him to die. He was lying, right?  \n[167]What was Mom like?  \n[168]But what about The Hood? (Alan points behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When Parker turns away Alan runs after his dad.  \n[169]Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage door and reaches it right as it slams shut) Dad! Dad!  \n[170]Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.   \n[171]He's getting weaker. He can't last much longer.  \n[172]I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we do.  Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to a police car outside the Bank of London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.  \n[173]Good job, Ferm.  \n[174]He's getting there. Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, blossoming.  "}}
