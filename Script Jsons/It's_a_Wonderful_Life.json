Anything? \n[25]Anything I can do back here? \n[26]I'll get them, sir. \n[27]Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir? \n[28]Is it a charge, sir? \n[29]Mr. Gower, I think... \n[30]Yes, sir. \n[31]Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy. \n[32]It's important. \n[33] \n[34]Pop! \n[35]Pop! \n[36]He's not a failure! You can't say that about my father! \n[37]You're not!

Look at the bottle you took the powder from. It's poison!  I tell you, it's poison!  I know you feel bad... and... \n[47]Don't hurt my sore ear again. \n[48]Don't hurt my ear again! \n[49]Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't. \n[50]Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Now, look, Joe.  Now, look, I... I want a big one. \n[51]Big - see!  I don't want one for one night.  I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand... a great big one. \n[52]Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost? \n[53]That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge. \n[54] \n[55] \n[56]I'm working across on a cattle boat. \n[57] \n[58]Mr. Gower... Mr. Gower... thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted. \n[59]Oh, it's wonderful. \n[60]Oh... Oh. Wish I had a million dollars. \n[61]Hot dog! \n[62]Hey, Ernie! \n[63]Hi, Bert. \n[64]Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style? \n[65]Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there. \n[66]  \n[67] \n[68]Okay, Mom. \n[69]Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy \u0096 my last meal at the old Bailey boarding house. \n[70]Oh, let him have the plates, Mother. \n[71]I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired. \n[72]Oh... \n[73]I wonder what's eating that old money grubbing buzzard anyway? \n[74]Got a match? \n[75]What do you mean, and be bored to death? \n[76]I hope it works. \n[77]Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school? \n[78]We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go. \n[79]Well, no younger than I was. \n[80]How's that? \n[81]Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about \u0096 build things... design new buildings \u0096 plan modern cities \u0096 all that stuff I was talking about. \n[82]No, I'll settle for half that in cash. \n[83]Well, I... Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable and you could hear everything that's going on. \n[84]You would, huh? \n[85]Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office. \n[86]Oh, I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that remark, but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe... I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important. \n[87] \n[88]You see what I mean, don't you, Pop? \n[89]Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy. \n[90]Oh, did you hear that, Annie? \n[91]I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party. \n[92]Here you are. \n[93]Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here? \n[94]Old college graduate now, huh? \n[95]Yep. \n[96]Hee-haw! \n[97]Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you? \n[98]Hello, Violet. \n[99]Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week. \n[100]What's that? \n[101]Oh, yeah, yeah. \n[102]Oh... me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids. \n[103]Well, excuse me, Violet. Don't be long, Marty. I don't want to be a wet nurse for... \n[104]Well... Well... Well... \n[105]Oh, why don't you stop annoying people? \n[106]Well, hello. \n[107]Well, I don't. \n[108]Me? \n[109]Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you. \n[110]  \n[111]I'm not very good at this. \n[112]Okay \u0096 what can we lose? \n[113]They're cheering us. We must be good. \n[114] \n[115]Hot dog! Just like an organ. \n[116]And I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death. You should have seen the commotion in that locker room. I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here. Here, let me hold that old wet dress of yours. \n[117]I guess I'm not quite the football type.  You... look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town. \n[118]I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway? \n[119]Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen. \n[120]Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you.  Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on. \n[121]I mean, without a dress. You look older...  I mean, younger. You look just... \n[122]Oh-oh... \n[123]A pox upon me for a clumsy lout. \n[124]Your... your caboose, my lady. \n[125]Ummmmm... \n[126]Hey \u0096 hey, Mary. \n[127]Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house. \n[128]No. You see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass. You got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too. \n[129] \n[130]In that place? \n[131]I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch... right on the second floor there. \n[132] \n[133]Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know... and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields.  I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long... \n[134]Are you gonna throw a rock? \n[135]Hey, that's pretty good. What'd you wish, Mary? \n[136] \n[137]What'd you wish when you threw that rock? \n[138]  \n[139]Come on, tell me. \n[140]What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say... \n[141] \n[142]...the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary. \n[143]Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much? \n[144] \n[145]How's that? \n[146] \n[147]Want me to kiss her, huh? \n[148] \n[149]Hey, hey, hold on. Hey, mister, come on back out here, and I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you... \n[150] \n[151]Okay, I give up. Where are you? \n[152]  \n[153]Here you are. Catch. \n[154]Wait a minute. What am I doing? This is a very interesting situation. \n[155]Hmm... A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day. \n[156]Not in Bedford Falls, anyway. \n[157]Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here. \n[158]I've heard about things like this, but I've never... \n[159]Oh, my mother's way up the corner there. \n[160]They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too. \n[161] \n[162]Mary... Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go. \n[163]Did you get a doctor? \n[164] \n[165]Thanks. \n[166]Thank you very much. \n[167]Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character. \n[168]Yes, sir. \n[169]Just a minute \u0096 just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why... Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them?  Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars?  Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be! \n[170]I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy! \n[171] \n[172] \n[173](indicating Board room \n[174]What's that? \n[175]Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy... \n[176] \n[177]Oh, there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel. Look at this. There... Venezuela oil fields \u0096 wanted, man with construction experience. Here's the Yukon, right here \u0096 wanted, man with engineering experience. \n[178]Thar she blows. You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are? \n[179]No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles. \n[180] \n[181]Oh, am I glad to see you. \n[182]She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go. \n[183]Hello. \n[184]Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing? \n[185]Harry, why didn't you tell somebody? What's a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine? \n[186] \n[187]Is it a good job? \n[188]And you did, too? \n[189]  \n[190] \n[191]Right down here. \n[192]Now you just turn this way and go right straight down. \n[193]Hello, Mom. \n[194]She's swell. \n[195]Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway. \n[196]Uh-huh. \n[197]Hmmmm... \n[198]Hmmmm... \n[199]Hmmm... \n[200]Hmmm... \n[201]Sure \u0096 Sam Wainwright. \n[202]Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary. \n[203]Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you? \n[204]Well then, how do you know? \n[205]Oh... \n[206]And all's fair in love and war? \n[207]Mother, you know, I can see right through you \u0096 right back to your back collar button... trying to get rid of me, huh? \n[208]Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry?  All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking. \n[209]Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction... This direction? Good night, Mrs. Bailey. \n[210] \n[211]Hello, Vi. \n[212] \n[213]Nothing. \n[214]Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library. \n[215]Yes... what are you doing tonight? \n[216]Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night of it. \n[217]Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass. \n[218]Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and... we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal... \n[219]Shhh... \n[220]Okay, just forget about the whole thing. \n[221]Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by. \n[222]How's that? \n[223]About what? \n[224]My mother just called you? Well, how did she know? \n[225]I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by... \n[226] \n[227]Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here. \n[228]When did you get back? \n[229]Where'd you get that dress? \n[230]It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them. \n[231] \n[232]All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here. \n[233]No, I don't want to be rude. \n[234] \n[235]Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here. \n[236]What's the matter? Oh, yeah... yeah... \n[237]Well, I... \n[238]Oh... yeah, yeah. That's all right. \n[239]Well, of course I like her. She's a peach. \n[240]No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you. \n[241] \n[242] \n[243]I don't know. You tell me. You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers.  You tell me. \n[244] \n[245]I forgot my hat. \n[246]Hello, Sam. \n[247] \n[248] \n[249] \n[250] \n[251]Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah... soybeans. Yeah. \n[252]Rochester? Well, why Rochester? \n[253]Oh, I don't know... why not right here?  You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down. \n[254]Money? Yeah... well, a little. \n[255] \n[256]Oh, Mary... Mary... \n[257]Mary... \n[258]  \n[259]Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab. \n[260]Oh, look at this. Champagne! \n[261]Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie.  Here, come on, count it, Mary. \n[262]You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels \u0096 the oldest champagne \u0096 the richest caviar \u0096 the hottest music, and the prettiest wife! \n[263] \n[264]That does it \u0096 come here. \n[265] \n[266]Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh... \n[267]I'll be back in a minute, Mary. \n[268]Hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are you? Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in? \n[269]What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday? \n[270]Come on in, everybody. That's right, just come in. \n[271]Now look, why don't you all sit down. There are a lot of seats over there. Just make yourselves at home. \n[272] \n[273] \n[274]Why didn't you call me? \n[275]All right now, what happened? How did it start? \n[276]When? \n[277]All of it? \n[278]Holy mackerel! \n[279]The whole town's gone crazy. \n[280]Hello? \n[281] \n[282] \n[283] \n[284] \n[285] \n[286] \n[287] \n[288] \n[289] \n[290] \n[291] \n[292]Yeah... ...you can take this one off now. \n[293]Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appears. \n[294]I have some news for you, folks. I've just talked to old man Potter, and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank. The bank's going to reopen next week. \n[295]Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him.  We don't need Potter over here. \n[296]No, but you... you... you're thinking of this place all wrong. As if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here. Your money's in Joe's house... ...right next to yours. And in the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Macklin's house, and a hundred others. Why, you're lending them the money to build, and then, they're going to pay it back to you as best they can. Now what are you going to do? Foreclose on them? \n[297] \n[298]Well, now that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares. \n[299]Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement. Now give us sixty days on this. \n[300]Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank.  He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us.  Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.  And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. \n[301]Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack? Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it? Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not.  That's why. He's picking up some bargains.  Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other. \n[302]Hey! I got two thousand dollars! Here's two thousand dollars. This'll tide us over until the bank reopen. All right, Tom, how much do you need? \n[303] \n[304]There you are. \n[305]Your account's still here. That's a loan. \n[306]Okay. All right, Ed? \n[307]Aw, now, Ed... what'll it take till the bank reopens? What do you need? \n[308]Twenty dollars. Now you're talking. Fine.  Thanks, Ed. All right, now, Mrs. Thompson. How much do you want? \n[309]Never mind about that. How much do you want? \n[310] \n[311]You don't have to sign anything. I know you'll pay it back when you can. That's okay. All right, Mrs. Davis. \n[312]Seven... Bless your heart, Of course you can have it. You got fifty cents? Seven... \n[313] \n[314]We made it! Look... ... look, we're still in business!

I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm going to build a bridge a mile long. \n[363]What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? If you do, just say the word; I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you. \n[364]Hi. \n[365]Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me? \n[366]You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town. \n[367]You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you... ...Your what? \n[368] \n[369]Lassos the stork! You mean you... What is it, a boy or a girl? \n[370]Hold on... hold on... hold on now.

I'll be right back. \n[385]  \n[386]Good morning, sir. \n[387]Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas. \n[388]We're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him. \n[389]Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke. \n[390]Well... ...now, come right in here, Mr. Carter. \n[391]No, no.

He's on the telephone. \n[397] \n[398]  \n[399] \n[400]It takes a lot of character to leave your home town and start all over again.  He pulls some money from his pocket, and offers it to her. \n[401]Here, now, you're broke, aren't you? \n[402]What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York?  You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls. \n[403]It's a loan. That's my business. Building and Loan. Besides, you'll get a job. Good luck to you. \n[404]Say hello to New York for me. \n[405]Now, let's hear from you... \n[406]What's the matter? Merry Christmas, Vi. \n[407]Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry. I'll be right with you.

All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house. \n[416]And did you put the envelope in your pocket? \n[417] \n[418]Listen to me. Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house? Someplace you could have put it? Someplace to hide the money? \n[419] \n[420] \n[421]That's what it means! One of us is going to jail! Well, it's not going to be me! \n[422] \n[423]What? What wreath? \n[424] \n[425]Yeah, just started. \n[426]Left them at the office. \n[427] \n[428]Must she keep playing that? \n[429] \n[430] \n[431] \n[432] \n[433]Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu? \n[434]What is it, a sore throat or what? \n[435]The doctor? Was the doctor here? \n[436]Is she running a temperature? What is it? \n[437]Gosh, it's this old house. I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia. This drafty old barn! Might as well be living in a refrigerator. Why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly, crummy old town? \n[438]Wrong? Everything's wrong! You call this a happy family? Why did we have to have all these kids? \n[439] \n[440]Going up to see Zuzu. \n[441]  \n[442]Well, what happened to you? \n[443]Wait now. Where do you think you're going? \n[444]All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink. \n[445]Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together. \n[446]There it is, good as new. \n[447]Now, will you do something for me? \n[448]  \n[449]Will you try to get some sleep? \n[450]I know \u0096 I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden. \n[451]Uh-huh. \n[452]Is that Zuzu's teacher? \n[453]Let me speak to her. \n[454] \n[455]Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for \u0096 to have teachers like you? Silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes... \n[456]Aw, that stupid... \n[457] \n[458]  \n[459]  \n[460]Oh... \n[461] \n[462]Tommy, stop that! Stop it! \n[463] \n[464] \n[465]What's the matter with everybody? Janie, go on. I told you to practice. Now, go on, play! \n[466]Mary... \n[467]I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter. I need help.  Through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts. The bank examiner's up there today. I've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately. \n[468] \n[469] \n[470]No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books. I've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. I can't find it anywhere. \n[471]Yes, sir. \n[472]No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow... \n[473]No, sir. No, sir. I haven't. \n[474] \n[475]I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe. \n[476]They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me. \n[477] \n[478] \n[479]Five hundred dollars. \n[480]God... God... Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up there and you can hear me, show me the way. I'm at the end of my rope. Show me the way, God. \n[481] \n[482]Oh \u0096 Welch. That's what I get for praying. \n[483]Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here... \n[484]I'm all right. \n[485]I'm all right. \n[486]  \n[487]  \n[488]You what? To save me? \n[489]Go through with what? \n[490] \n[491]Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago. \n[492] \n[493]What are you, a mind reader or something? \n[494]Well, who are you, then? \n[495]Odbody... A-S-2. What's that A-S-2? \n[496]Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks? \n[497]Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to save me? \n[498]I wouldn't be a bit surprised. \n[499] \n[500]Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings? \n[501]I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. \n[502] \n[503]Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you? \n[504]Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. \n[505]I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive. \n[506]  \n[507] \n[508] \n[509]I said I wish I'd never been born. \n[510]What did you say? \n[511]  \n[512]Say something else in that ear. \n[513]Well, that's the doggonedest thing... I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water. \n[514]What do you know about that... What's happened? \n[515]It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry... \n[516]What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought. Now, come on, get your clothes on, and we'll stroll up to my car and get... \n[517]Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly. \n[518]You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right. \n[519] \n[520]Well, I had a car, and it was right here.  I guess somebody moved it. \n[521]Oh, say... Hey... where's my car? \n[522]My car, my car. I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree. \n[523]What do you mean, what tree? This tree.  Here, I ran into it. Cut a big gash in the side of it here. \n[524] \n[525]Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is... ...or you are! \n[526]Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel. \n[527]Clarence! Clarence! \n[528] \n[529]There's a place to sit down. Sit down. \n[530]Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini? \n[531]No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he? \n[532]Okay \u0096 all right.

You got someplace to sleep? \n[536]You don't huh? Well, you got any money? \n[537]No wonder you jumped in the river. \n[538]Oh, that's right. \n[539]Made what? \n[540]Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here. \n[541] \n[542]  \n[543]Look, Nick. What's wrong? \n[544]Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it? \n[545]  \n[546]Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me? \n[547] \n[548]What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly... \n[549] \n[550]Look, who are you? \n[551]Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What... are you a hypnotist? \n[552]Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things? \n[553]Then if I wasn't born, who am I? \n[554]What do you mean, no identity?

George Bailey. \n[80]Yes, old moss-back George. \n[81]Wait a minute. I'll call him. George! \n[82]He does so. He asked for him. Geo... George, Sam wants to speak to you. \n[83] \n[84]Mother's on the extension. \n[85] \n[86]We can both hear. Come here. \n[87] \n[88] \n[89] \n[90]George... George... George... \n[91]  \n[92]Good old Bert. \n[93]I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look! \n[94]After that, who cares? \n[95] \n[96]George, let's not stop. Let's go! \n[97]Please, let's not stop, George. \n[98]How much do you need? \n[99] \n[100]  \n[101]Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for. \n[102] \n[103]Oh, who cares. Bread! That this house may never know hunger. \n[104] \n[105]Nice meeting you. \n[106]Have fun. \n[107] \n[108] \n[109]Hi. \n[110]To keep from being an old maid. \n[111]I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you. \n[112]My baby. \n[113]George Bailey lassos stork. \n[114]Hello darling. \n[115] \n[116]Bless you! \n[117]Did you bring the wreath? \n[118]The Merry Christmas wreath for the window. \n[119]Is it snowing? \n[120]Where's your coat and hat? \n[121]What's the matter? \n[122]Go on, Pete, you're a big boy.  You can put the star up. Way up at the top. That's it.  Fill in that little bare spot right there.  That's it. Isn't it wonderful about Harry? We're famous, George. I'll bet I had fifty calls today about the parade, the banquet. Your mother's so excited, she... \n[123] \n[124]Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner. \n[125]Have a hectic day? \n[126]All right, darling, you're excused. Now go upstairs and see what little Zuzu wants. \n[127]Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat. \n[128]Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious. \n[129]Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about. \n[130]Just a teensie one \u0096 ninety-nine, six.  She'll be all right. \n[131] \n[132]Where're you going? \n[133]\n[134]I'll get it. Hello. Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey. \n[135]Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right. The doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her Christmas dinner. \n[136] \n[137] \n[138]Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...  hello... hello... She's hung up. \n[139]George... \n[140] \n[141]Bedford, two-four-seven, please. \n[142]Yes, Janie, pray very hard. \n[143]You too, Tommy. Hello, Uncle Billy? \n[144] \n[145] \n[146]  \n[147]George, darling! Where have you been? \n[148]Oh, George, George, George. \n[149]Oh, George, George! \n[150]You have no idea what happened... \n[151]Well, come on, George, come on downstairs quick. They're on their way. \n[152]Come on in here now. Now, you stand right over here, by the tree. Right there, and don't move, don't move. I hear 'em now, George, it's a miracle! It's a miracle! \n[153]Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In here! \n[154] \n[155] ", "Hatch": "\n[1]  \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]All right, dear. \n[5]Mary! Mary! \n[6]Who's down there with you? \n[7]George Bailey? What's he want? \n[8]You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either. Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight. \n[9]Mary! Mary! The telephone! It's Sam! \n[10]Mary, he's waiting! \n[11]He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot! \n[12] \n[13]  ", "Mrs.": "\n[1]Help my son George tonight. \n[2] \n[3]Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes. \n[4]Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school? \n[5]Came back three days ago. \n[6]Nice girl, Mary. \n[7]Kind that will help you find the answers, George. \n[8]Oh, stop that grunting. \n[9]Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary? \n[10]Hmmm? \n[11]Well, she's not crazy about him. \n[12]No. \n[13]Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around. \n[14]And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls. \n[15] \n[16]Uh-huh. \n[17]Oh, George! \n[18]All right, dear. \n[19]Mary!

It's Sam! \n[24]Mary, he's waiting! \n[25]He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot! \n[26]  \n[27]First Harry, now George. Annie, we're just two old maids now. \n[28]Are you going to go to Potter's? \n[29]But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money. \n[30]But it's your own money, George. \n[31]I can get along with twenty, all right. \n[32]And I'll sign a paper. \n[33]Could I have seventeen-fifty? \n[34]Harry, how about your banquet in New York? ", "Potter": "\n[1]Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse. \n[2] \n[3]Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages? \n[4]Then foreclose! \n[5] \n[6]They're not my children. \n[7]Are you running a business or a charity ward? \n[8] \n[9] \n[10]So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me. \n[11]Gives you an idea of the Baileys. \n[12]Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose. \n[13]Wait for what?  I claim this institution is not necessary to this town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver. \n[14]I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan. \n[15]Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.  He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town. Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi.  You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why? \n[16] \n[17]You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say... \n[18]I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan. \n[19]Sentimental hogwash! I want my motion... \n[20] \n[21]George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors. Is that true?  Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that...  George, are you all right? Do you need any police? \n[22] \n[23] \n[24]Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know. George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis. I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.  They'll close up for a week, and then reopen. \n[25] \n[26] \n[27]I may lose a fortune, but I'm willing to guarantee your people too. Just tell them to bring their shares over here and I will pay them fifty cents on the dollar. \n[28] \n[29] \n[30]If you close your doors before six P.M. you will never reopen. \n[31] \n[32]  \n[33]Oh, they are, are they? Even though they know the Baileys haven't made a dime out of it. \n[34] \n[35]The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough. \n[36]Come in here. \n[37] \n[38]You like it? I'll send you a box. \n[39] (pleasantly and smoothly \n[40]The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side.  Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight...  married, making, say... forty a week. \n[41]Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man \u0097 who hates his job \u0096 who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped.  Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate? \n[42]My point? My point is, I want to hire you. \n[43]I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year. \n[44]You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George? \n[45]Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in \u0096 providing he has brains enough to climb aboard. \n[46]Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it? \n[47]Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife. \n[48]In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers. \n[49] \n[50]You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town. Buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year.  Maybe to Europe once in a while. \n[51] \n[52]How does slacker George feel about that? \n[53]Bad ear. \n[54] \n[55]Bailey... \n[56]Take me back there. Hurry up. Come on, look sharp. \n[57] \n[58] \n[59] \n[60] \n[61] \n[62] \n[63]Yes. They called me up from your Building and Loan. Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too. He's looking for you. \n[64] \n[65] \n[66]Have you notified the police? \n[67] \n[68]What is it \u0096 a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick. \n[69]Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money? \n[70]Well, what about all your other friends? \n[71]I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks? \n[72]Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind? \n[73]Yes... how much is your equity in it? \n[74] \n[75]All right, George, go ahead. You can't hide in a little town like this. \n[76] \n[77] \n[78]Happy New Year to you \u0096 in jail! Go on home \u0096 they're waiting for you!

Meet the wife. \n[23]George... about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it. You've been holding the bag here for four years, and... well, I won't let you down, George.  I would like to... Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back. \n[24]Hello, George, how are you? \n[25] \n[26]Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram. \n[27]Good idea, Ernie. A toast... to my big brother, George.

I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills? \n[19]Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring? \n[20]I know. I know. He didn't go. \n[21]Yes, but what happened to George? \n[22]No! \n[23]Yes, but George... \n[24]  \n[25]I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. My wife gave me this on my last birthday. I passed away in it. \n[26]Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now. \n[27]I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George. \n[28]Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you? \n[29]Suicide. \n[30]Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too. \n[31]Heaven. I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you. \n[32]Your lip's bleeding, George. \n[33] \n[34]Oh, I know all about you.

Your father's had a stroke! \n[9]Yes, Campbell's there now. \n[10] \n[11](trying to control himself \n[12]Boy, oh, boy, that was telling him, George, old boy. You shut his big mouth. You should have heard him. \n[13]Well, we're being voted out of business after twenty-five years. Easy come, easy go. \n[14]Hey, you'll miss your train. You're a week late for school already. Go on. \n[15]Oh, never mind. Don't worry about that.  They're putting us out of business. So what? I can get another job. I'm only fifty-five. \n[16]Go on \u0096 go on. Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip, now you don't want to miss college too, do you? \n[17]Whoopee! \n[18]Uh-huh.

You know that. \n[21]How do you do. \n[22]Huh? \n[23]Well, what do you know \u0096 wife. \n[24] \n[25]It was a surprise to me. This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife. Old, old friend of the family. \n[26]And I want to tell you, we're going to give the biggest party this town ever saw. \n[27]  \n[28]Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good I could spit in Potter's eye. I think I will. What did you say, huh? Oh, maybe I'd better go home. \n[29]Where's my hat? Where's my... \n[30]Oh, thank you, George. Which one is mine? \n[31]Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy.  Now, look \u0096 if you'll point me in the right direction... would you do that?

I'm all right. \"... the sweetest flower that grows... \" \n[35]George... \n[36]George, can I see you a minute? \n[37] \n[38]I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle. \n[39]How does anything like this ever start?  All I know is the bank called our loan. \n[40]About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash. \n[41]Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe. \n[42]And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I... I... I... \n[43]Yes, hello? George... it's Potter. \n[44] \n[45] \n[46] \n[47] \n[48]George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there. \n[49] \n[50]Those Rockefellers! \n[51]We'll save them for seed. A toast!

That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys? You just can't keep those Baileys down, now, can you, Mr. Potter? \n[57]Very jealous, very jealous. He only lost three buttons off his vest. Of course, slacker George would have gotten two of those medals if he had gone. \n[58]Yes. \n[59]After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay home. Not every heel was in Germany and Japan! \n[60] \n[61]Huh? \n[62]What? \n[63]Sure, sure I am. \n[64]Oh, shucks... \n[65] \n[66]Hmm? Well, I... \n[67] \n[68]I should have my head examined. Eight thousand dollars. It's got to be somewhere. \n[69] \n[70] \n[71]Nothing.
