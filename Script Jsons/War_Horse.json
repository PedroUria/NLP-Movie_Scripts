Please let me. I can do it. \n[7]Right. Let's make a start then. \n[8]It's oats. Very tasty, that is. It's beef and gravy to us! \n[9]Come on... \n[10]I bet you're missing your mother. Look at you... first time without your mum. First time away from home. But you're not alone, are you. In fact. Cos I'm `ere... \n[11]It's alright. It's alright. 11. \n[12]I'm gonna call you Joey. Understand? Joey. That's you. And I'm Albert. It's alright, You're mine now. You're mine. \n[13]Whoa. I want you to stay there, Joey. Stay. That's it. Good boy.

Good boy. You've got it. Good boy. \n[17]Come now, Joey. Come on. \n[18]You can come now, Joey. \n[19]No, I read it in a story. It's how the Indians used to summon their horses. \n[20]Now, Joey, when I whistle, you've gotta come, understand? \n[21]He's not a dog. He's just puzzling it through. 13. \n[22]What if he doesn't? \n[23]No, please. Sir, you can't do that. \n[24]You can't harness him. \n[25]No, you can't. Look, you're scaring him, Dad.

We'll get it done. \n[31]How are you today, Joey? I don't know much about life, boy, but I do know that there are big days and there are small days. And most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone - but this - well, this is a big one. This is our big day. Well, it's cold out there. So I'm going to take this off -  Well, if it's tough for you - it should be tough for me, too... 18. \n[32]Now, I'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. Is that understood?

Good boy. \n[41]Do you know - I believe we can do it, Joey. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the best of us. That's why he bought you. He knows you've all the courage he never had. I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us. \n[42]Whoa. Whoa. \n[43]Now, boy! You've got to do it, Joey. You don't know, so I'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! So get set to pull - and pull straight! And pull hard! \n[44]Now, boy! Go! \n[45]Walk on, Joey! Walk on! That's it! Good boy, Joey! Good boy! \n[46]Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey! Joey! Joey, whoa whoa whoa! Joey, stop! You'll break the blade - 24. \n[47]And where's Dad? \n[48]Stumbling about, I suppose. \n[49] \n[50]Well, he don't talk to me about it. \n[51]Not dad's? \n[52] \n[53] \n[54]I'm not stealing it. I'll give it back to him, someday. \n[55]Come on, boy, let's show her how to fly! 30. \n[56]Well...you're clearly not gonna be a jumper. \n[57]We can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob. \n[58]How else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent? 31. \n[59]Look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock Fair! \n[60]What has he done with him? \n[61]You can't! You can't, he's mine! I trained him! 34. \n[62]You can't have him. He's my horse, sir. \n[63]  \n[64]Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too.

I'll give you twice - \n[103]Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know everything! \n[104]Don't be worried, boy, when I go. I won't worry over you none.

Are you out of your mind? What about the rent? \n[8]How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that? Ted - you have to take him back. You have to take him back right now now. \n[9]You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back. \n[10]And how are you gonna train a horse with that leg? \n[11]No, you stay out of this, Albie. You don't know nothing about horses. \n[12]Right. Well... you've got one month to break him in or I'm taking him back myself. (She turns to the house, but then... How did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high? \n[13]We're gonna lose everything. After all we've been through - we're gonna lose it all. 10. \n[14]Well, you better.

No. Ted, no! \n[21]You shoot that horse we have nothing. 17. \n[22]\n[23]Here, here. Some days are best forgotten. Today ain't one of them.

Push on through! \n[26]Here. It's his campaign pennant. He were Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. \n[27]Albert and Joey are now in a meadow. They trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which Ted tends to. The sun is breaking through and Joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline. As both Joey and Albert gain confidence they pick up speed. Albert pushes Joey on, they are going faster and faster, Albert yells with the exhilaration of it all. Joey races flat out across the countryside. Albert hanging on for dear life. Albert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons' car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively- tailored rural gentry. \n[28]  \n[29]  \n[30]Shoo, Harold.

Easy, now, easy now, Englishman... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now, easy. \n[6]Well, well, look at you. Whoever taught you this has just saved your life. \n[7]They're pushing through? \n[8]Yes, sir.
