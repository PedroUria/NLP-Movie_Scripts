Kate opens \t\ther eyes.  Jack\u0092s not in bed.  A look of curiosity.  \t\tThen, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.  \t\tShe goes over to the window...opens the blinds... \t\trevealing...  \t\tJack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the \t\tsnow with Annie and Josh.  \t\tKate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her \t\tface...  \n[20] \t\t...Jack reaches out and snags Annie...she CACKLES in \t\tdelight...  \t\tThe three of them fall over onto the soft white snow...  \t\tThe laughter from the kids is uncontrollable, Jack\u0092s \t\tjoy is just as palpable...  \t\tFinally, Annie stops laughing and grabs Jack around the \t\tneck, hugging his tight.  \n[21] \t\tJack walks to Josh.  He\u0092s sleeping soundly.  \t\tJack gently kisses Josh on the head, careful not to \t\twake him.  \n[22] \t\tJack is standing over Annie, kissing her on the cheek.  \n[23] \t\tThe clock reads, \u009311:17.\u0094  Kate is already in bed as \t\tJack walks in.  \n[24] \t\tThe room is dark...  \t\tJack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.  \t\tHe sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad \t\tlook in his eyes...  \t\tAs he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own \t\teyelids appear to grow heavy...  \t\tHe tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes... \t\tfocusing on her...but it\u0092s no use...  \t\tFinally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep \t\tsleep...  \n[25] \t\tJack\u0092s Ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops \t\tout. He races to the front door, POUNDING on it...  \t\tA MAN in a Van Heusen shirt and Hagar slacks answers. \t\tJack stares at him in shock.  ", "Betty": "", "Peterson": "\n[1]\t\t\t   Hello Jack.  You don\u0092t \t\t\t   have to stop singing on \t\t\t   my account...  \n[2]\t\t\t   You know you could never \t\t\t   satisfy me the way he \t\t\t   does...  \t\tThe doors open to the lobby.  Mrs. Peterson walks out \t\tahead.  \n[3]\t\t\t\t(to Tony re: \t\t\t\t Jack, annoyed \t\t\t   Who is this man?  \t\tTony shrugs his shoulders.  \n[4]\t\t\t\t(raising a hand \t\t\t\t to Tony \t\t\t   No...  \n[5]\t\t\t   And sleep you shall. \t\t\t   Noblesse oblige is not \t\t\t   dead.

", "Kate": "\n[1]\t\t\tI got you a few necessities...  \t\tKate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegut\u0092s \u0093Cat\u0092s \t\tCradle.\u0094  \n[2]\t\t\tYour copy was a mess...  \t\tJack accepts the book but he\u0092s unable to take his eyes \t\toff Kate.  She hands him a cassette.  \n[3]\t\t\tEvery one of these songs will \t\t\tremind you of me in a slightly \t\t\tdifferent way...  \n[4]\t\t\tI also put side two of London \t\t\tCalling on there...  \t\tKate leans over and kisses him passionately on the \t\tlips.  \n[5]\t\t\tThat was not officially the \t\t\tgoodbye kiss. It was just an \t\t\tinterim kiss...  \t\tHe looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her \t\tclose, kissing her deeply. Then...  \n[6]\t\t\tYou have your ticket?  \t\tJack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE.  Kate \t\tnods. They embrace and kiss again.  As they separate.  \n[7]\t\t\tWait.  \t\tJack turns. Kate approaches him.  \n[8]\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about \t\t\tthis.  \n[9]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI know we\u0092ve talked about this a \t\t\tthousand times and we both agree \t\t\tthat going to London is the \t\t\tright thing to do. But in my \t\t\theart... this feels wrong.  \t\tShe looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, \t\tthen back into Jack\u0092s eyes.  \n[10]\t\t\tDon\u0092t  go, Jack...  \n[11]\t\t\tBelieve me I know what an \t\t\tincredible opportunity this \t\t\tis for you...  \n[12]\t\t\tRight, for us. But...I\u0092m \t\t\tafraid that if you get on \t\t\tthat plane...  \n[13]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tGo. I\u0092m sorry, you should just \t\t\tgo...  \n[14]\t\t\tWe're being responsible.  Go. \t\t\tGet on the plane.  \t\tHis eyes narrow as he measures her determination...  \n[15]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tGet the hell outta my sight. \t\t\tYou bother me.  \t\tA laugh from Jack.  Kate gives him a calm smile and a \t\tnod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for \t\tJack.  \n[16]\t\t\tI can't seem to let go of \t\t\tyou...  \n[17]\t\t\tYou want to do something \t\t\tgreat, Jack?  Let's flush the \t\t\tplan...start our lives right \t\t\tnow, today...I don't know what \t\t\tthat life's gonna look like \t\t\tbut I do know it has both of \t\t\tus in it.  And I choose us...  \t\tJack is jolted by her words.  \n[18]\t\t\tThe plan doesn't make us \t\t\tgreat, Jack.  What we have \t\t\ttogether, that's what makes us \t\t\tgreat.  \t\tHer words sink in...A long moment of decision...He \t\tlooks toward the gate, only one person left in \t\tline...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.  \t\tFinally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...  \n[19] \t\t...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter \t\tcontentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...  \t\tHis head darts around the room - it\u0092s cramped and lived \t\tin, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on \t\tthe dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed \t\tand a charming little bay window.  \t\tHe instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch \t\ton the night stand, but it\u0092s not there.  It\u0092s a Timex \t\tIndiglo and it reads, \u00937:57 A.M...\u0094  \t\tJack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe it\u0092s \t\ta dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...  \n[20]\t\t\t   Mmmm...ten more minutes, \t\t\t   Jack... it\u0092s Christmas...  \t\tJack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...  \t\tSuddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, \t\tANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room \t\tcarrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top \t\tof her lungs...  \n[21]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   You\u0092re jumping, \t\t\t   sweetheart...  \t\tJack looks at this activity like a man at his own \t\tfuneral.  \n[22]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Mommy needs five more \t\t\t   minutes in la la land. \t\t\t   That could be her \t\t\t   present...  \t\tJosh crawls directly up to Jack\u0092s stomach, climbing \t\ton.  \n[23]\t\t\t   Jack...?  \t\tJack turns by instinct.  Kate grabs him, drawing him \t\tnear.  A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her \t\teyes...  \t\tEye contact...Jack\u0092s certain he\u0092s about to hear her \t\tscream...  \n[24]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Strong coffee, okay?  \t\tShe lets him go as Jack backs out the door...  \n[25]\t\t\t\t(calling from \t\t\t\t the bedroom \t\t\t   Use an entire can if you \t\t\t   have to!  \t\tHe looks back at the bedroom, then at the \t\tstairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still \t\tin shock.  \t\tHe grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front \t\tdoor...about to step out when he looks down and \t\trealizes...  \t\t...he\u0092s barefoot.  He glances at a pair of rubber over- \t\tboots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to \t\tleave when...  \t\tHe hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door \t\tlock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to \t\tdo...  \t\tThe door opens...into the house, arms laden with \t\twrapped gifts, walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both \t\t60s), Kate\u0092s parents.  Big Ed\u0092s wearing a ten gallon \t\that and a suede overcoat.  Lorraine has a cigarette \t\tdangling from her mouth.  \n[26]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Hold on a second...  \t\tShe cups the receiver.  Jack looks at her, she\u0092s \t\tdressed now, nothing fancy but she looks great.  \n[27]\t\t\t   Ten years ago...  \t\tKate just stands there looking at Jack, giving away \t\tnothing.  \n[28]\t\t\t   Are you okay?  \n[29]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Never mind, he just \t\t\t   walked in...  \t\tJack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then \t\tstares him down angrily.  \n[30]\t\t\t   Do you have any idea what \t\t\t   you put us through \t\t\t   today?!  You walk out of \t\t\t   here at 7:30 in the \t\t\t   morning, don\u0092t tell me \t\t\t   where you\u0092re going, or \t\t\t   even that you\u0092re going, \t\t\t   and I don\u0092t see you \u0091til \t\t\t   hours later.  I had state \t\t\t   troopers looking for \t\t\t   you!  I called \t\t\t   hospitals... \t\t\t\t(pointing at \t\t\t\t the phone \t\t\t   ...I was just on the \t\t\t   phone with the morgue \t\t\t   for god\u0092s sake!  \t\tJack watches her vent, the frustration on his face \t\tbuilding.  \n[31]\t\t\t   What kind of man leaves \t\t\t   his family on Christmas \t\t\t   morning without a word \t\t\t   about where he\u0092s going?  \t\tJack\u0092s almost to a breaking po\tINT.  \n[32]\t\t\t   What kind of man does \t\t\t   that!?  \n[33]\t\t\t   Where were you?  \n[34]\t\t\t   The city?  New York \t\t\t   City?  Why?  \n[35]\t\t\t   Jack...don\u0092t even \t\t\t   start...  \n[36]\t\t\t   You know what, Jack? \t\t\t   It\u0092s not funny this \t\t\t   time.  I\u0092m really angry.  \t\tShe stares him down, expecting an answer.  But he has \t\tno answer.  \n[37]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Jack!  \t\tJack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash \t\tgave him, holds it up in front of her and starts \t\tRINGING it furiously.  \t\tThen...Annie rides into the room on her new bike.  \n[38]\t\t\t   You missed the whole \t\t\t   thing, Jack.  The \t\t\t   pancakes, the \t\t\t   presents...you spent six \t\t\t   hours putting that bike \t\t\t   together and you didn\u0092t \t\t\t   even get to see the look \t\t\t   on Annie\u0092s face when she \t\t\t   opened it...  \t\tJack sees the disappointment on her face...  \n[39]\t\t\t   You missed Christmas, \t\t\t   Jack.  \t\tJack looks down, almost ashamed...he relents, giving in \t\tto the moment...  \n[40]\t\t\t   Look, we don\u0092t have time \t\t\t   for this right now, we\u0092ll \t\t\t   talk about it later.  Now \t\t\t   get dressed... \t\t\t\t(pointing to his \t\t\t\t outfit \t\t\t   You\u0092re not wearing that \t\t\t   to the Thompsons\u0092 party. \t\t\t   I don\u0092t care how \t\t\t   hilarious you think it \t\t\t   is...  \n[41]\t\t\t   You look forward to this \t\t\t   party all year.  What\u0092s \t\t\t   with you today?  \n[42]\t\t\t   Fine.  Do whatever you \t\t\t   want.  \t\tShe picks up the phone, starts dialing...  \n[43]\t\t\t   Telling my mother she \t\t\t   doesn\u0092t have to stay with \t\t\t   the kids.  \n[44]\t\t\t   Because you\u0092ll be here.  \t\tKate just looks at him.  \n[45]\t\t\t   Funny, Jack.  I\u0092m \t\t\t   laughing on the inside.  \n[46]\t\t\t   Jack...?  \t\tJack turns, sees Kate standing in the doorway, watching \t\thim take his frustrations out on the phone, concern on \t\ther face.  \n[47]\t\t\t   Are you sure you\u0092re \t\t\t   okay...?  \t\tA forced smile from Jack.  \n[48]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Uh huh...  \t\tKate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table.  \n[49]\t\t\t   You must really love \t\t\t   Evelyn\u0092s mushroom puffs, \t\t\t   huh? \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   You know they\u0092re not \t\t\t   real...  \t\tShe turns and leaves...Jack looks at her, confused...  \n[50]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...then she asks me to \t\t\t   put this sweater on. \t\t\t   What choice do I have, \t\t\t   right?  \t\tJack watches as Kate charms the crowd...  \n[51]\t\t\t   But as I\u0092m slipping it on \t\t\t   I notice she\u0092s misspelled \t\t\t   the word \u0093lawyers.\u0094 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   I had to go through the \t\t\t   entire day wearing a hand \t\t\t   embroidered sweater that \t\t\t   said, \u0093Non-Profit Layers \t\t\t   Do It For Free.\u0094  \t\tThe guests laugh again.  Even Jack finds himself \t\tlaughing, until...  \n[52]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Jack...  \n[53]\t\t\t   I better go wake my \t\t\t   mother...  \t\tKate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to Jack.  \n[54]\t\t\t   Here you go...  \n[55]\t\t\t   She\u0092s your dog, Jack.  \n[56]\t\t\t   Fine, she\u0092s the kid\u0092s \t\t\t   dog.  Let\u0092s go wake Josh, \t\t\t   see if he wants to walk \t\t\t   her.  \n[57]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   You\u0092re having a bad day, \t\t\t   I\u0092ll go with \t\t\t   you...actually, there\u0092s \t\t\t   no way in hell you\u0092re \t\t\t   gettin\u0092 me back out \t\t\t   there...  \t\tJack looks at the dog\u0092s face.  Lucy couldn\u0092t be more \t\texcited.  Finally, Jack shakes his head and takes the \t\tleash.  \n[58]\t\t\t\t(heading up the \t\t\t\t stairs \t\t\t   Make sure you reward her \t\t\t   verbally when she does a \t\t\t   number two...  \n[59]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...my feet are hurtin\u0092...  \n[60]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   And...?  \t\t...her expression makes Jack turn his gaze from her \t\tnaked body.  \n[61]\t\t\t   Don\u0092t give me that look, \t\t\t   Jack, Tuesday\u0092s your day \t\t\t   and you know it.  And try \t\t\t   to get Josh to day care \t\t\t   on time, okay?  He missed \t\t\t   the macaroni painting \t\t\t   last week...  \t\tShe closes the curtain and turns the radio back up.  \n[62]\t\t\t   The kids are asleep...  \t\tShe goes over to the window and draws the blinds.  Jack \t\tlooks up at her, nods, then goes back to the TV.  \n[63]\t\t\t   Jack.  I said the kids \t\t\t   are asleep...  \n[64]\t\t\t   I thought we had a deal \t\t\t   about you watching CNBC \t\t\t   in bed.  \n[65]\t\t\t   Fine, but not tonight...  \t\tShe climbs onto the bed, a seductive look on her face.  \n[66]\t\t\t   That is the general idea, \t\t\t   yes...  \t\tKate starts kissing him...but Jack\u0092s a little \t\tuncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, \t\ta little nervous.  \n[67]\t\t\t   It\u0092s ten thirty, Jack. \t\t\t   By eleven you\u0092re gonna be \t\t\t   sprawled out on the bed \t\t\t   snoring your head off. \t\t\t   We don\u0092t have time for \t\t\t   wining and dining.  \n[68]\t\t\t   Thanks, Jack...  \n[69]\t\t\t   This is good stuff, Jack, \t\t\t   keep it coming...  \n[70]\t\t\t   How can you do that?  \n[71]\t\t\t   Look at me like you \t\t\t   haven\u0092t seen me every day \t\t\t   for the last twelve \t\t\t   years...  \t\tJack freezes.  There\u0092s love in her eyes but it\u0092s not \t\tmeant for him...  \t\tShe kisses him...  \n[72]\t\t\t   Don\u0092t move.  \t\tShe gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom...  \t\tHe looks around...not sure what to do...Finally...  \t\tHe turns onto his side and closes his eyes...  \t\tKate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the \t\tbed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...  \t\tAt once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs.  She \t\tturns off the CD player and heads into bed.  \t\tShe pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the \t\tlight... She puts an arm around him, kissing him \t\tsweetly on the neck...  \n[73]\t\t\t   \u0091night, honey...  \t\tClose in on Jack\u0092s face...turned away from Kate...he \t\topens his eyes...looks down at her arm...loneliness on \t\this face...  \n[74]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe\u0092re almost done here...  \n[75]\t\t\tThat\u0092s right.  Okay, \t\t\tlet\u0092s make a quick stop \t\t\tat the kids\u0092 shoe \t\t\tdepartment, pick up my \t\t\twatch from the battery \t\t\tplace, then I\u0092ll run into \t\t\tthe linen store...  \t\tAn unhappy look on Jack\u0092s face.  \n[76]\t\t\tYou know what, Jack?! \t\t\tI\u0092ll go with the kids. \t\t\tWhy don\u0092t you just hang \t\t\tout here in the men\u0092s \t\t\tdepartment... okay?  \t\tJack glances at the Men\u0092s Dept., sighs and gives Kate a \t\tnod.  She takes off with the kids...and then he sees \t\tit...  \t\t...the Zegna section.  He\u0092s drawn to the neat rows of \t\tbeautiful suits like a moth to the light...  \t\tHe approaches the rack, pulls out a dark green suit, \t\tgently touching the soft wool.  \n[77]\t\t\tYou look amazing in that \t\t\tsuit...  \t\tJack snaps out of his trance.  He sees Kate standing \t\tbehind him, Annie and Josh happily playing a few feet \t\taway. \n[78]\t\t\tI mean...wow...off the \t\t\tcharts great.  \n[79]\t\t\t$2,400?!  Are you out of \t\t\tyour mind?  \n[80]\t\t\tThose shoes were twenty \t\t\tfive dollars.  C\u0092mon, \t\t\ttake it off.  We\u0092ll go to \t\t\tthe food court and get \t\t\tone of those funnel cakes \t\t\tyou like.  \t\tJack looks at her...it\u0092s a moment of decision.  \n[81]\t\t\tNo?  \n[82]\t\t\tExcuse me?  \n[83]\t\t\tReally.  \n[84]\t\t\tIt\u0092s sad to hear your \t\t\tlife is such a \t\t\tdisappointment to you, \t\t\tJack.  \n[85]\t\t\tWho are you?  \t\tKate\u0092s words pierce Jack...he has to avert his eyes.  \n[86]\t\t\tMaybe you\u0092re not.  The \t\t\tJack Campbell I married \t\t\twouldn\u0092t need a $2400 \t\t\tsuit to make himself feel \t\t\tbetter about his life, \t\t\tbut if that\u0092s what it\u0092s \t\t\tgonna take, then buy it. \t\t\tJust buy the goddamn \t\t\tsuit ...we can take the \t\t\tmoney out of the kids\u0092 \t\t\tcollege fund.  \t\tThey stare at each other for a moment...a stand-off...  \n[87]\t\t\tI\u0092ll give you this, life \t\t\thas thrown us a few \t\t\tsurprises...  \t\tA glimmer in Jack\u0092s eye...  \n[88]\t\t\tWell...Annie for one.  \n[89]\t\t\tI think it worked out \t\t\tokay, don\u0092t you?  \n[90]\t\t\tGood, Jack.  Maybe we\u0092ll \t\t\tkeep her.  \n[91]\t\t\tWe were young... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tRemember that little \t\t\tplace on Charles Street \t\t\twe used to go to?  \n[92]\t\t\tYou can\u0092t really raise a \t\t\tkid in an apartment in \t\t\tthe Village...  \t\tJack nods, starting to piece it together.  \n[93]\t\t\tThe trek out to the \t\t\thospital every day didn\u0092t \t\t\thelp either... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou were great. \t\t\tSurviving the heart \t\t\tattack was one thing...  \n[94]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tJack, stop that. I'm \t\t\tstill mad at you... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t...who knows what \t\t\twould\u0092ve happened if you \t\t\thadn\u0092t stepped in at the \t\t\tstore.  \n[95]\t\t\tIf you want to look at it \t\t\tthat way...  \n[96]\t\t\tA great success story...  \t\tA smile from Jack.  He admires her outlook even if he \t\tcan\u0092t bring himself to share it.  \n[97]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHow was the game, honey?  \n[98]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou mean this chocolate \t\t\tcake?  \n[99]\t\t\tIt\u0092s good...  \t\tJack approaches the counter.  \n[100]\t\t\tNo way.  \t\tHe makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out \t\twhere he can\u0092t reach it.  \n[101]\t\t\tSorry, Jack.  It\u0092s too \t\t\timportant to me.  \t\tThey stare each other down a moment.  Then...  \t\tHe tries to swipe the plate.  Kate jumps out of her \t\tchair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, \t\tlaughing...  \t\tJack takes off after her...chasing her through the \t\thouse... just about the catch up to her when...  \t\tShe darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows \t\ther...  \n[102]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou want the cake!?  \n[103]\t\t\tIt\u0092s good, right?  \t\tHe takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her \t\tmouth.  \t\tThey stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding \t\teach other cake, laughing.  \t\tJack leans back on the stairs.  He looks at Kate\u0092s \t\tface, practically covered in cake, smiling, and \t\trealizes...  \t\t...he hasn\u0092t laughed like this in thirteen years. \t\tThen...  \n[104]\t\t\t\t(caught up in the \t\t\t\t moment \t\t\tSay it, Jack...  \n[105]\t\t\tC\u0092mon, you know what I \t\t\tlike to hear...  \n[106]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThen say it...just say it \t\t\tto me...!  \n[107]\t\t\tWhat...?  \t\tJack looks up at her, he can practically see the \t\tpassion drain from her face...  \n[108]\t\t\tNice, Jack.  You\u0092re \t\t\tsweeping me off my feet.  \n[109]\t\t\tJack.  \n[110]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tTime to get up, honey...  \t\tJack obliges without question, getting out of bed, \t\tputting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still \t\tpractically half-asleep.  \n[111]\t\t\tHappy Anniversary, \t\t\thoney...  \t\tTerror on Jack\u0092s face.  \n[112]\t\t\t\t(pushing the gift \t\t\t\t forward \t\t\tBefore you do whatever \t\t\tcrazy stunt you\u0092ve got \t\t\tplanned I want you to \t\t\topen mine...  \t\tJack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.  \n[113]\t\t\tNo, open it...  \t\tHe hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, \t\trevealing...  \t\t...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna \t\tsuit...  \n[114]\t\t\tI found it at an outlet \t\t\tstore.  I know it\u0092s a \t\t\tknock-off, but I think \t\t\tit\u0092ll look great on \t\t\tyou...  \n[115]\t\t\tEnjoy it, sweetheart...  \t\tJack looks at Kate\u0092s expectant face, suddenly \t\tremembering how truly screwed he is.  \n[116]\t\t\tWhat are you talking \t\t\tabout?  You never wait \t\t\tall day.  You can barely \t\t\twait until it\u0092s light \t\t\tout.  \n[117]\t\t\tYou forgot.  \t\tJack stands there, silent.  \n[118]\t\t\tYou actually forgot our \t\t\tanniversary.  \n[119]\t\t\t\t(holding back \t\t\t\t the tears \t\t\tJesus, Jack...Is this \t\t\twhere we are now?  Is \t\t\tthis our marriage? \t\t\tSuddenly I\u0092m the wife who \t\t\thas to drop hints two \t\t\tweeks before her \t\t\tanniversary so her \t\t\thusband doesn\u0092t fuck it \t\t\tup?  \t\tJack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on \t\this...  \n[120]\t\t\t\t(shaking her head, \t\t\t\t crying \t\t\tI don\u0092t want to be that, \t\t\tJack...  \t\tJack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes \t\tit away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...  \t\tJack is left standing alone, holding Kate\u0092s gift...  \n[121]\t\t\tWhich do you think?  \t\tAnnie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very \t\tseriously...  \n[122]\t\t\tFighting\u0092s a part of it, \t\t\tAnnie.  You know that, \t\t\tright?  \n[123]\t\t\tC\u0092mere.  \t\tKate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a \t\tlipstick...  \n[124]\t\t\tNow go like this...  \t\tKate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do \t\tit.  Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her \u0096 \t\tAnnie\u0092s beaming.  \n[125]\t\t\tYou\u0092re gonna break a lot \t\t\tof hearts, you know.  \t\tA smile from Annie...  \t\tPull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, \t\twatching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...  \n[126]\t\t\tYou okay?  \t\tHe takes Kate by the arm...  \n[127]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tJack...can we afford all \t\t\tthis?  \n[128]\t\t\tHow do you even know \t\t\tabout this place?  \t\tJack\u0092s caught for a moment.  Then...  \n[129]\t\t\tIt\u0092s five hundred and \t\t\tfifty dollars, Jack!  \t\tA wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost \t\tperfect.  \n[130]\t\t\tYou are so not off the \t\t\thook yet, slick.  \n[131]\t\t\tI don\u0092t think there\u0092s \t\t\tdancing here, Jack.  \t\tJack gets up and holds out a hand.  \n[132]\t\t\t\t(whispering to \t\t\t\t Jack \t\t\tPretty good for a tire \t\t\tsalesman from Jersey...  \t\tJack flashes her his most charming smile.  \n[133]\t\t\tMmmm... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t...here, try one of \t\t\tthese...  \t\tJack takes a scallop from Kate\u0092s fork.  \n[134]\t\t\tOkay...  \n[135]\t\t\tNow I\u0092m worried...just \t\t\tsay it.  Whatever it is \t\t\twe\u0092ll deal with it.  \n[136]\t\t\tWorse, you mean...  \n[137]\t\t\tAnd now...?  \n[138]\t\t\tMe neither.  \t\tA raised eyebrow from Jack.  \n[139]\t\t\tI think it\u0092s good to be a \t\t\tlittle unsure about who \t\t\tyou are.  It\u0092s very \t\t\thuman.  \n[140]\t\t\tC\u0092mon, Jack, you think \t\t\tthere aren\u0092t mornings \t\t\twhen I wake up and wonder \t\t\twhat the hell I\u0092m doing \t\t\tin New Jersey...  \n[141]\t\t\tMy office is a dump, I \t\t\tanswer my own phone...and \t\t\tyou\u0092ve seen my pay check.  \n[142]\t\t\tI mean yes, I help people \t\t\tthat need it...  \n[143]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tGod, sometimes I think it \t\t\twould be so nice not to \t\t\thave to stretch ground \t\t\tbeef or maybe drive a car \t\t\twith a CD player...  \t\tHe smiles, right there with her.  \n[144]\t\t\tImagine having a life \t\t\twhere everything was \t\t\teasy...where you asked \t\t\tfor things and people \t\t\tjust brought them to \t\t\tyou...  \n[145]\t\t\tI think about it, too, \t\t\tJack.  I do.  I think \t\t\tabout the kind of person \t\t\tI\u0092d be if I hadn\u0092t \t\t\tmarried you...  \t\tIt\u0092s as if she\u0092s inside his head.  They stay like this \t\tfor a moment, looking into each other.  \n[146]\t\t\tAnd I realize I\u0092ve just \t\t\terased the things in my \t\t\tlife I\u0092m most sure \t\t\tabout.  You, the kids...  \t\tJack nods.  \n[147]\t\t\tWhat are you sure about?  \t\tJack looks into Kate\u0092s eyes.  \n[148]\t\t\tThis is so beautiful...  \t\tJack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a \t\tsilver ice bucket...  \n[149]\t\t\tYou know champagne makes \t\t\tme do crazy things.  \n[150]\t\t\tI don\u0092t know how you did \t\t\tit, hoss, but you pulled \t\t\tit off.  \n[151]\t\t\tWay out...  \t\tKate saunters into the bedroom, looking at the king- \t\tsize poster bed, feeling the down quilt.  Jack follows \t\ther...  \n[152]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou may even get lucky \t\t\ttonight...  \t\tKate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see \t\tthe powerful effect it has on him.  \t\tJack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost \t\tin her.  \n[153]\t\t\tI already told you you \t\t\twere gonna get lucky, \t\t\tJack...  \t\tThey kiss again, a long soulful kiss.  Then...  \t\tJack pulls back, a look of realization on his face...  \n[154]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat\u0092s all I wanted to \t\t\thear...  \t\tShe kisses him, their bodies intertwined...hands \t\tcaressing ...more and more passionate...then reaches \t\tbehind her to the light.  The room goes dark...  \n[155]\t\t\tMmmm...Jack...  \t\tKate lifts her head, turning to face Jack.  \n[156]\t\t\tI feel like I should give \t\t\tyou money...  \t\tJack laughs.  \n[157]\t\t\tI mean, my god, Jack you \t\t\twere always good but \t\t\tthis...this was... like a \t\t\tporno movie.  \t\tKate lays her head back on Jack\u0092s chest, looking at \t\tWashington Square through the window.  \n[158]\t\t\tI could stay here \t\t\tforever...  \n[159]\t\t\tHave a good day...  \t\tA smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends \t\thim on his way...  \n[160]\t\t\tIt\u0092s like a museum.  \t\tJack nods.  \n[161]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSo what\u0092s the big \t\t\tsurprise? You didn\u0092t \t\t\trent this place for \t\t\tthe weekend, did you?  \n[162]\t\t\tFor the week?  \t\tJack chuckles.  \n[163]\t\t\tA perk for what?  \n[164]\t\t\tWhat are you talking \t\t\tabout, Jack?   \n[165]\t\t\tAre you out of your mind?  \n[166]\t\t\tAnnie goes to a great \t\t\tschool.  \n[167]\t\t\tJack, what could you \t\t\tpossibly be thinking? \t\t\tWhat about my job?  \n[168]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI can\u0092t believe you want \t\t\tto move back into the \t\t\tcity.  I thought the \t\t\treason we left was \t\t\tbecause we didn\u0092t want to \t\t\traise the kids here?  \n[169]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tJack.  \t\tJack\u0092s starting to struggle...  \n[170]\t\t\tIn traffic?  It\u0092s over an \t\t\thour each way?  That\u0092s \t\t\talmost three hours a \t\t\tday.  When are you going \t\t\tto see the kids?  \t\tHe\u0092s frustrated...he pauses a moment to gather \t\thimself. Then...  \n[171]\t\t\tThen get a goddamn snow \t\t\tblower!  \t\tJack\u0092s taken aback by the intensity of her tone.  \n[172]\t\t\tDon\u0092t get a new career \t\t\twithout even telling me. \t\t\tDon\u0092t take Annie out of a \t\t\tschool she loves.  Don\u0092t \t\t\tmove us out of a house \t\t\twe\u0092ve become a family \t\t\tin...  \t\tKate stands there, wounded...  \n[173]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDon\u0092t do that...  \n[174]\t\t\tThey already do envy us, \t\t\tJack...  \t\tKate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.  \n[175]\t\t\tOur finest moment, \t\t\tright...  \t\tA quizzical look from Jack.  \n[176]\t\t\tWhen you got on that \t\t\tplane I was sure it was \t\t\tover.  I left the airport \t\t\tafraid I\u0092d never see you \t\t\tagain.  And then you \t\t\tshowed up the very next \t\t\tday... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThat was a good \t\t\tsurprise...  \t\tShe continues into the room, leaning against a \t\tbookshelf.  \n[177]\t\t\tI think about you on that \t\t\tplane, about what must \t\t\thave been going through \t\t\tyour mind...you sitting \t\t\tthere imagining our life \t\t\ttogether, our life \t\t\tapart...I think about the \t\t\tdecision you made...  \t\tJack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.  \n[178]\t\t\tMaybe I was being naive \t\t\tbut I believed we\u0092d grow \t\t\told together in this \t\t\thouse.  That we\u0092d spend \t\t\tholidays here, have g \t\t\trandchildren visit us \t\t\there.  I had this image \t\t\tof us all grey and \t\t\twrinkly, me working in \t\t\tthe garden, you \t\t\trepainting the deck...  \t\tKate smiles gently as she pictures this.  \n[179]\t\t\tThings change, right? \t\t\tPeople change... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tIf you need this, Jack, I \t\t\tmean really need this, I \t\t\twill take these children \t\t\tfrom a life they love, \t\t\tand take myself from the \t\t\tonly home we\u0092ve ever \t\t\tshared, and move wherever \t\t\tyou need to go.  I\u0092ll do \t\t\tthat because I love \t\t\tyou...  \t\tThe words are like a warm embrace for Jack...  \n[180]\t\t\tI love you, Jack. And \t\t\tthat\u0092s more important to \t\t\tme than our address...  \t\tKate smiles lovingly at Jack...she walks over to him, \t\tkisses him gently on the forehead.  \n[181]\t\t\tI choose us.  \t\tShe turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, \t\tthe boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at \t\ther as she goes...  \n[182]\t\t\t\t(looking up from \t\t\t\t her book \t\t\tHey...  \t\tJack approaches her, sitting on the bed...  \n[183]\t\t\tIt\u0092s been interesting, \t\t\tthat\u0092s for sure.  \n[184]\t\t\tYou\u0092ve been Jack \t\t\tCampbell.  And that\u0092s \t\t\talways a good thing...  \t\tShe kisses him on the cheek.  \t\tHe takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the \t\teyes.  \n[185]\t\t\tAre you okay, Jack?  \n[186]\t\t\tI promise, Jack...  \n[187]\t\t\tI promise. Come to bed, \t\t\thoney.  \t\tJack stands up, heading toward the door.  \n[188] \t\tJack\u0092s limo pulls up outside this house on Washington \t\tMews...  \t\tJack gets out...  \n[189]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDid you call the airline \t\t\tlike I asked?!  \t\tJack\u0092s eyes come alive as Kate appears wearing jeans \t\tand a white blouse...except for her hair, she looks the \t\tsame.  \n[190]\t\t\tJack...God, it\u0092s been so \t\t\tlong...You look...  \t\tShe searches for a kind word, but he looks terrible.  \n[191]\t\t\tIt\u0092s good to see you...  \t\tShe looks at him another moment, then turns...  \n[192]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tLori! Where\u0092s that box?!  \t\tKate walks inside, Jack follows her in sheepishly.  \n[193] \t\t...Jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes, \t\tsending a GLASS CANDY DISH CRASHING to the floor, \t\tSHATTERING it...  \n[194]\t\t\tDon\u0092t worry about it, Jack...  \t\tJack looks up at...a beehive of activity \u0096 Lori on the \t\tphone, boxes stacked everywhere, TWO MOVERS packing \t\tup...  \n[195]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI\u0092m moving to Paris...it was \t\t\tright here... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt\u0092s a box marked \u0093Jack.\u0094  I \t\t\tput it in the stack for the \t\t\tSalvation Army...  \n[196]\t\t\tHey, kind of under a little \t\t\tpressure here.  \n[197]\t\t\tYou didn\u0092t seem to mind \t\t\toffering to help me on \t\t\tChristmas day when you were \t\t\tunwrapping that Prada bag \t\t\tI gave you.  \n[198]\t\t\tUh huh. To Paris. My firm \t\t\thas an office there and \t\t\tI\u0092m going to be heading \t\t\tit up.  \n[199]\t\t\t\t(searching the \t\t\t\t boxes \t\t\tThat\u0092s the one...  \n[200]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNot with what they pay me...  \n[201]\t\t\tNo, Jack, I never got \t\t\tmarried. You?  \n[202]\t\t\tYes!  \t\tA relieved smile from Jack...  \n[203]\t\t\tI found it!  \n[204]\t\t\tHere you go.  It\u0092s just \t\t\tsome old things of yours...  \t\tJack stands here, looking at the box, then at Kate...  \n[205]\t\t\tYou\u0092re serious...  \t\tA nod from Jack...  \n[206]\t\t\tI\u0092ll tell you what, Jack, \t\t\tif you\u0092re ever in Paris, \t\t\tlook me up. Maybe we\u0092ll \t\t\tgo for that cup of coffee.  \t\tOne of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...  \t\tJack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that \t\tthis isn\u0092t the same woman he knew thirteen years \t\tago, or left yesterday.  \n[207]\t\t\tJesus, Jack...  \n[208]\t\t\tJack.  \n[209]\t\t\tWhat do you want from me? \t\t\tYou want me to tell you \t\t\teverything that happened \t\t\twas okay?  \t\tJack just stands there, unsure...  \n[210]\t\t\tWell it is. Yes, I was \t\t\theartbroken ...But I got \t\t\tover it. I moved on. \t\t\tPeople change, Jack. I \t\t\tchanged. I don\u0092t know \t\t\twhy you suddenly feel the \t\t\tneed to revisit that time \t\t\tin our lives but I assure \t\t\tyou, it\u0092s over...  \t\tKate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing \t\tthere...  \t\tHe watches her walk to the podium, realizing she\u0092s \t\tright...  \t\tHe sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the \t\tattendant...  \t\tFinally, a look of determination crosses his face...  \n[211]\t\t\tDon\u0092t do this, Jack... \t\t\tBut he continues...  \n[212]\t\t\tOkay, Jack...  ", "Reynolds": "\n[1] \t\t...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter \t\tcontentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...  \t\tHis head darts around the room - it\u0092s cramped and lived \t\tin, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on \t\tthe dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed \t\tand a charming little bay window.  \t\tHe instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch \t\ton the night stand, but it\u0092s not there.  It\u0092s a Timex \t\tIndiglo and it reads, \u00937:57 A.M...\u0094  \t\tJack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe it\u0092s \t\ta dream...but nothing changes.  Then, Kate stirs...

Something isn\u0092t right. She \t\tlooks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, \t\ttrying to decide...  \n[3]\t\t\tAbout the plane? What do you \t\t\tthink it\u0092s gonna crash? Don\u0092t \t\t\tsay that...  \n[4]\t\t\tYou mean don\u0092t go at all? \t\t\tWhat about my internship?  \n[5]\t\t\tFor us, Kate.  \n[6]\t\t\tWhat?  \t\tKate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she can\u0092t \t\tsay...  \n[7]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tNo, you\u0092re right.

She waits, almost \t\twilling it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it \t\tdoesn't...  \n[13] \t\tA huge space with gleaming hardwood floors, ornate \t\tmoldings, and a great view of the Hudson and Jersey \t\tbehind it...  \t\tThe place looks like a museum display...everything is \t\tof the highest quality and meticulously maintained.  \t\tA wall of photos - Jack and Clinton, Jack with Patrick \t\tEwing, Jack between Alan Greenspan and Henry Kravis.  \t\tAnd a \"Willie Mays\" baseball bat encased in glass...  \n[14] \t\t...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.  \t\tClose in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans \t\tmustache and long hair, opens his eyes. \t\tA FLASH of bright morning light from the window.

You know what the \t\t\t   traffic's gonna be like?  \n[22]\t\t\t   I've got plenty of places to \t\t\t   go.  \t\tHe stays there, confident, sexy, waiting for an \t\tanswer...  \n[23]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   If it's something you feel \t\t\t   strongly about. \t\tPaula walks to the door, then turns back to Jack.  \n[24] \t\tJack saunters over to a Yamaha Grand Disclavier in the \t\tliving room.  He puts a disk into the piano and...  \t\t...the keys come alive with the music of BACH.  Jack \t\thits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is \t\tenveloped in music...  \n[25] \t\tPaula, waiting for the elevator, hears the MUSIC \t\temanating from Jack\u0092s apartment...an intrigued glance \t\tback at the apartment door as the elevator arrives...  \n[26] \t\tBack\u0092s \u0093Passion According to St. Matthew\u0094 is blaring \t\tthrough the speakers, the music is swelling to full \t\torchestra...  \t\tJack\u0092s at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble- \t\ttiled bathroom, shaving with a silver-plated Hammacher \t\tSchlemmer razor, HUMMING with the orchestra...  \n[27] \t\t...the size of a small house, a long row of Zegna \t\tsuits, shoe trees stacked with Italian shoes, tailored \t\tshirts everywhere.  \t\tJack\u0092s still HUMMING to the music as he dresses in \t\tfront of a mirror.  \n[28]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Mrs. Peterson.  \n[29]\t\t\t   It\u0092s because I\u0092m shy, \t\t\t   Betty.  So, when are you \t\t\t   going to leave that old \t\t\t   corpse Mr. Peterson and \t\t\t   run away with me?  \n[30] \t\tTONY THE DOORMAN holds the door open for Jack and Mrs. \t\tPeterson...  \n[31]\t\t\t   How\u0092d you do this year, \t\t\t   Tony?  \n[32]\t\t\t   Just until the Deutsche \t\t\t   Mark turns...  \t\tJack exits the building...  \n[33] \n[34]\t\t\t   ...if MedTech's shares sink \t\t\t   any lower than... \t\t\t\t(casually executing \t\t\t\t a keystroke \t\t\t   ...forty three, we're in \t\t\t   trouble with the stock \t\t\t   valuation.  So for god's sake \t\t\t   watch what you say to your \t\t\t   institutional customers...  \t\tJack notices Alan Mintz playing with the cherub.  \n[35]\t\t\t   ...we still have almost a full \t\t\t   day of trading before zero \t\t\t   hour and I don't want any \t\t\t   trouble... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...penny for your thoughts, \t\t\t   Alan...  \t\tAlan looks up.  \n[36]\t\t\t   Is that tonight?  \t\tA LAUGH from the group.  Jack approaches Alan.  \n[37]\t\t\t   You think I like being here on \t\t\t   Christmas Eve, Alan?  \n[38]\t\t\t   Okay, maybe I do have a touch \t\t\t   of tunnel vision this holiday \t\t\t   season.  But in two days we're \t\t\t   going to announce one of the \t\t\t   largest mergers in U.S. \t\t\t   corporate history.  Thirty \t\t\t   billion dollars... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   When this kind of deal turns \t\t\t   up you get on and you ride it \t\t\t   `till it's over.  You don't \t\t\t   ask it for a vacation...  \t\tA chuckle from the group...the esprit de corps seems to \t\tenergize Jack.  \n[39]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   December 26th.  After that \t\t\t   there'll be so much money \t\t\t   floating around here it'll be \t\t\t   like Christmas every day... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   December 26th, people.  If \t\t\t   you'd like to celebrate that \t\t\t   day, you all have my \t\t\t   blessing...  \t\tEnthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits \t\taround the table...  \n[40]\t\t\t   I don't want you to be sorry, \t\t\t   Alan, I want you to be \t\t\t   excited.  I want my gift to be \t\t\t   the first one you open this \t\t\t   year.  You know why?  \n[41]\t\t\t   Because my gift comes with ten \t\t\t   zeroes at the end...  \t\tA MURMUR of excitement in the room, even Alan cracks a \t\tsmile.  Jack puts a hand on Alan's shoulder.  \n[42]\t\t\t   Good man...  \n[43]\t\t\t   You too?  This holiday's about \t\t\t   giving, Adelle.  And I'm \t\t\t   giving everything I've got to \t\t\t   this deal, so in a way, I'm \t\t\t   more Christmassy than \t\t\t   anyone... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Lifesaver?  \n[44] \t\t...continuing past Adelle's desk, Jack looking at his \t\tmessages, and into Jack's office...  \n[45] \t\tA cavernous office, you could land a helicopter in it - \t\thigh tech fixtures, full bar, leather sofa, $3,000 \t\tStairmaster...  \t\tJack walks to an enormous, bare mahogany desk, and sits \t\tdown in a high tech ergonomic leather chair.  \n[46]\t\t\t   Ooh, my suits are ready...  \t\tHe gets to the last message, sees the name on it, and \t\treels back.  \n[47]\t\t\t   Kate Reynolds...  \n[48]\t\t\t   Her assistant?  \n[49]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Kate Reynolds was my \t\t\t   girlfriend in college.  I \t\t\t   almost married her...  \n[50]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Almost married.  And almost a \t\t\t   junior broker at E.F. \t\t\t   Hutton...  \n[51]\t\t\t   She didn't want me to go to \t\t\t   London.  We're standing at the \t\t\t   airport saying goodbye and she \t\t\t   asks me to stay.  \n[52]\t\t\t   God, no.  I thought about it \t\t\t   for practically the entire \t\t\t   flight...  \n[53]\t\t\t   I took the road less traveled, \t\t\t   Adelle.  \n[54]\t\t\t   No...  \n[55]\t\t\t   She's probably just having a \t\t\t   fit of nostalgia.  You know, \t\t\t   lonely Christmas Eve, call the \t\t\t   one that got away, that kind \t\t\t   of thing.  \t\tAdelle rolls her eyes at him.  \n[56]\t\t\t   I'm telling you, it's ancient \t\t\t   history...  \t\tJack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and \t\tchairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into \t\tthe room.  \n[57]\t\t\t   Peter.  I don't see you \t\t\t   rushing home to trim the tree.  \n[58]\t\t\t   And God love you for it.  \t\tLassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite \t\tJack.  \n[59]\t\t\t   That'll happen when you're \t\t\t   about to spend thirty billion \t\t\t   dollars on some aspirin...  \n[60]\t\t\t   Why are you staring at my \t\t\t   breasts, Peter?  \n[61]\t\t\t   Where is he?  \n[62]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I \t\t\t   won't be able to make it \t\t\t   tomorrow...  \t\tAdelle rolls her eyes at him...  \n[63]\t\t\t   Hey Peter, lemme ask you a \t\t\t   question.  An old girlfriend \t\t\t   calls you out of the blue on \t\t\t   Christmas Eve...  \n[64]\t\t\t   Not by a long shot.  \n[65]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   I'll leave from the office \t\t\t   tomorrow afternoon.  Call the \t\t\t   group.  Schedule an emergency \t\t\t   strategy session for noon.  \n[66] \t\tJack is alone in the office working on his computer, \t\tchecking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.  \t\tJack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He \t\tchecks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes \t\tto the window, sees the city in all its Christmas \t\tglory, then he see it...  \t\t...the message from Kate, crumpled in the \t\ttrashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at \t\tthe night...  \n[67]\t\t\t   I'm thinking I might walk \t\t\t   tonight, Frank.  \n[68]\t\t\t   Thanks.  To you too...  \t\tJack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads \t\tout into the crisp night air...  \n[69]\t\t\t   Egg nog?  \n[70]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Let me see that ticket.  \t\tCash turns to Jack.  \n[71]\t\t\t   Maybe I'll buy it from you.  \t\tNow Cash walks over to Jack...  \n[72]\t\t\t   Hey, c'mon...  \t\tIn a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his \t\tpants, aiming it at Jack's face.  The woman SCREAMS, \t\tcovers her baby.  \n[73]\t\t\t   No. \n[74]\t\t\t   Look, I'm talking about a \t\t\t   business deal here.  I buy the \t\t\t   ticket for two hundred, take \t\t\t   it to a store where the guy \t\t\t   behind the counter... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...doesn't have a death wish \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...I just made myself a quick \t\t\t   thirty eight dollars.  \t\tCash gets closer...  \n[75]\t\t\t   Like I said, it's a business \t\t\t   deal...  \n[76]\t\t\t   How'd you know my name was \t\t\t   Jack?  \n[77]\t\t\t   There's no way I was gonna die \t\t\t   in that deli... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Let's just say I've been on a \t\t\t   lucky streak lately.  \n[78]\t\t\t   I don't do that.  That's just \t\t\t   not for me...  \t\tCash looks at him, then smiles.  \n[79]\t\t\t   Hey...  \t\tCash turns around.  \n[80]\t\t\t   What do you want to carry that \t\t\t   gun around for, anyway? \t\t\t   You're just gonna do something \t\t\t   you'll regret...  \n[81]\t\t\t   I'm just saying that you seem \t\t\t   like a smart guy.  At a \t\t\t   certain point you're gonna do \t\t\t   something, and then there's no \t\t\t   turning back...  \n[82]\t\t\t   I mean there must be programs \t\t\t   out there, opportunities...  \n[83]\t\t\t   Everyone needs something.  \t\tCash looks at Jack...  \n[84]\t\t\t   Me?  \n[85]\t\t\t   I've got everything I need.  \n[86]\t\t\t   Look, I'm not saying you'd be \t\t\t   able to do it without some \t\t\t   hard work...  \n[87]\t\t\t   Sure it's about you.  But it's \t\t\t   about society, too.  \n[88] \t\tJack walks in and throws his keys on a table.  He takes \t\toff his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then \t\theads into the bedroom.  \t\tThrough the large windows we see snow falling...  \n[89] \t\tJack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...  \n[90]\t\t\t\t(drawing on a \t\t\t\t memory \t\t\t   Ed?  Lorraine?  \t\tBig Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of \t\tgifts.  \n[91]\t\t\t   Excuse me.  \t\tJack dashes out the door.  \n[92]\t\t\t   Where\u0092s my car?!  Where\u0092s \t\t\t   my Ferrari!?  \n[93]\t\t\t   Look, can I just borrow \t\t\t   your car?!  I promise \t\t\t   it\u0092ll be returned!  \n[94]\t\t\t   Tony, thank god...  \t\tJack starts to walk past but Tony blocks the way.  \n[95]\t\t\t   What are you talking \t\t\t   about?  It\u0092s me, Jack \t\t\t   Campbell.  Penthouse C. \t\t\t   I put you into commercial \t\t\t   paper!  \n[96]\t\t\t   Elizabeth Peterson!  \t\tThe little dog starts BARKING ferociously at Jack.  \n[97]\t\t\t   You know me, Betty.  You \t\t\t   do.  Jack Campbell. \t\t\t   We\u0092re on the co-op board \t\t\t   together.  We fought side \t\t\t   by side for garbage \t\t\t   disposals.  Every morning \t\t\t   we exchange quasi-sexual \t\t\t   witty banter.  Think...  \t\tShe looks at Jack with a raised eyebrow, the dog still \n[98]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Thank you, Betty.  I know \t\t\t   if I can just sleep this \t\t\t   off, I\u0092ll be fine...  \n[99]\t\t\t   A shelter?!  I\u0092m the \t\t\t   richest guy in the \t\t\t   building...I\u0092ve got twice \t\t\t   the square footage you \t\t\t   have!  \t\tMrs. Peterson shakes her head at him, a look of pity on \t\ther face.  \t\tFrustrated, Jack turns and runs back to the mini-van...  \n[100]\t\t\t   Frank.  Where\u0092s Alan \t\t\t   Mintz?  Is he here yet?  \n[101]\t\t\t   Look, I don\u0092t know what\u0092s \t\t\t   going on here but I am \t\t\t   Senior Vice President of \t\t\t   this company.  \n[102]\t\t\t   Maybe you\u0092re not hearing \t\t\t   me.  I am Jack \t\t\t   Campbell... \t\t\t\t(approaching the \t\t\t\t building directory \t\t\t   Right here.  Jack \t\t\t   Campbell, President...  \t\tAnd then he sees it...\u0094ALAN MINTZ - PRESIDENT,\u0094 listed \t\tplain as day on the building director...  \t\tJack looks at Frank, then back to the building \t\tdirectory...  \t\tA pitying look from Frank...Jack stands there, in \t\tshock...  \n[103]\t\t\t   That\u0092s my car!  You stole \t\t\t   my car!  \n[104]\t\t\t   What?!  \n[105]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   What the hell is \t\t\t   happening to me?!  \t\tJack\u0092s freaking out and Cash is enjoying every minute \t\tof it.  Cash hands Jack a paper bag.  Jack starts \t\tbreathing into the bag.  \n[106]\t\t\t   Brought what on myself?! \t\t\t   I didn\u0092t do anything!  \n[107]\t\t\t   You mean because you \t\t\t   thought I was cocky I\u0092m \t\t\t   now on a permanent acid \t\t\t   trip?!!  \t\tCash gets a laugh out of Jack\u0092s overreaction...  \n[108]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Give me my goddamn life \t\t\t   back!  \n[109]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Please.  Just tell me \t\t\t   what\u0092s happening to me. \t\t\t   In plain English.  None \t\t\t   of that mumbo jumbo...  \t\tCash turns to Jack.  \n[110]\t\t\t   I glimpse?  A glimpse of \t\t\t   what!?  What glimpse?! \t\t\t   Glimpse!  \n[111]\t\t\t   I asked you a direct \t\t\t   question!  A glimpse of \t\t\t   what?!  \t\tA look from Cash.  \n[112]\t\t\t   How much time?!  \n[113]\t\t\t   Look, I just want my life \t\t\t   back.  Now what\u0092s it \t\t\t   gonna take?  You wanna \t\t\t   talk turkey?  Let\u0092s talk \t\t\t   turkey!  How much \t\t\t   money...?  \t\tCash looks at Jack, relishing the moment.  He flashes \t\tJack a smile.  \n[114]\t\t\t   Why not?  \n[115]\t\t\t   Figure it out?  Figure \t\t\t   what out?!  \t\tCash just stares at him...  \n[116]\t\t\t   That\u0092s it?  That\u0092s all I \t\t\t   get?!  A glare?!  \n[117]\t\t\t   Look, I don\u0092t have time \t\t\t   for this right now.  I\u0092m \t\t\t   in the middle of a \t\t\t   deal... \n[118]\t\t\t   You know what?  I\u0092ve had \t\t\t   it with you.  I\u0092ve had it \t\t\t   with all of this shit...  \t\tSCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically \t\tsending Jack through the windshield.  \t\tJack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next \t\tto the mini-van.  \t\tCash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to \t\tJack...  \n[119]\t\t\t   What\u0092s this, a signal? \t\t\t   Will you come whenever I \t\t\t   ring it?  \n[120]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   But what do I do?  \n[121]\t\t\t   Hey, you did this to me, \t\t\t   you can\u0092t just leave me \t\t\t   like this.  \t\tCash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.  \n[122]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Thanks, man...  \t\tJack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn \t\taround, Cash\u0092s door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in \t\ta blast of horsepower...  \t\tJack stands there gazing down the street, listening to \t\tthe sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, \t\tdisappearing...  \t\tThe wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the \t\tLassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, \t\tand finally to the mini-van.  \n[123]\t\t\t   Excuse me.  Do you know \t\t\t   where Merrison Street is?  \t\tArnie looks up and sees Jack in the van.  \n[124]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Great room...  \t\tA satisfied smile from Arnie, Jack\u0092s approval means \t\tsomething to him.  \n[125]\t\t\t   We\u0092re friends, aren\u0092t we?  \n[126]\t\t\t   I\u0092m having kind of a bad \t\t\t   day.  \n[127]\t\t\t   Is it...?  \n[128]\t\t\t   I don\u0092t think so.  \n[129]\t\t\t   Kate\u0092s my wife...  \t\tJack looks at Arnie as if he\u0092s seeking confirmation.  \n[130]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   It\u0092s just two kids, \t\t\t   right?  \t\tA chuckle from Arnie.  \n[131]\t\t\t   You cut your hair...  \t\tA curious look from Kate.  \n[132]\t\t\t   Yeah...fine.  \t\tShe gives him a resolute nod, then...  \n[133]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   I don\u0092t know!  Please \t\t\t   stop yelling at me!  \t\tShe looks at him curiously.  \n[134]\t\t\t   I was in the city.  \n[135]\t\t\t   Because that\u0092s where I \t\t\t   live.  \n[136]\t\t\t   Look, you don\u0092t \t\t\t   understand.  I woke up \t\t\t   here...and this is very \t\t\t   strange ...this is not my \t\t\t   house...  \t\tA raised eyebrow from Kate.  Jack moves around the \t\troom...  \n[137]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   I\u0092m not \u0093Dad...\u0094.  Kate, \t\t\t   you\u0092re not my wife...  \t\tKate looks him over, assessing, then...  \n[138]\t\t\t   I\u0092m...I\u0092m sorry.  \t\tKate looks at him.  He seems sincere enough...  \n[139]\t\t\t   Party?  Oh no, I can\u0092t go \t\t\t   to a party...  \n[140]\t\t\t   Trust me on this Kate.  I \t\t\t   really don\u0092t think going \t\t\t   to a party is the right \t\t\t   move for me at the \t\t\t   present time.  \t\tKate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.  \n[141]\t\t\t   What are you doing?  \n[142]\t\t\t   Why not?  \n[143]\t\t\t   I\u0092ll be ready in ten \t\t\t   minutes.  \t\tHe walks past her...toward a hallway door, Kate \t\twatching him...  \t\tHe opens the door...it\u0092s a closet.  \n[144]\t\t\t   Christ... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Where the hell is the \t\t\t   bathroom?  \n[145]\t\t\t   This is just... \t\t\t\t(searching for \t\t\t\t the words \t\t\t   ...this is sub-par...  \t\tAnnie appears at the bedroom door, watching Jack at the \t\tcloset.  \t\tHe turns...sees Annie watching him...a look \t\texchanged... then, Annie runs away...  \t\tJack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a \t\tpair of the slacks...  \n[146]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t It\u0092s lovely...  \n[147]\t\t\t   The Nets?  You\u0092re kidding, \t\t\t   right...?  \t\tNick looks at him in disbelief.  \n[148]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Well...they\u0092re certainly \t\t\t   due.  \t\tBILL KRAMER, a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his \t\tplate, tugs at Jack\u0092s shirt.  \n[149]\t\t\t   Okay...why?  \n[150]\t\t\t   Triple bypass? \t\t\t\t(pointing to his \t\t\t\t plate \t\t\t   You really think you \t\t\t   should be eating all \t\t\t   that?  \n[151]\t\t\t   I don\u0092t think so, thank \t\t\t   you...  \n[152]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   They\u0092re great!

A dial tone.  Jack slams the phone down...  \n[155]\t\t\t   Damnit!  \t\tHe slams the phone again...and again...and again...  \n[156]\t\t\t   Yes, I\u0092m fine.  It\u0092s just \t\t\t   this god awful football \t\t\t   phone!  Who has a phone \t\t\t   like this anyway?!  \n[157]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   So you\u0092re a lawyer...?  \t\tA chuckle from the group.  Kate\u0092s confused.  \n[158]\t\t\t   A non-profit lawyer...  \t\tPeople are starting to LAUGH.  \n[159]\t\t\t   Pro bono.  You don\u0092t get \t\t\t   paid at all.  Nobody \t\t\t   makes a dime.  Well, \t\t\t   bravo...  \t\tBlank stares from everyone, including Kate...  \n[160]\t\t\t   You\u0092re kidding me...  \n[161]\t\t\t   No, she\u0092s not.  \n[162]\t\t\t   But it\u0092s twenty degrees \t\t\t   outside...  \n[163]\t\t\t   Figure it out...I\u0092m s \t\t\t   crewed...don\u0092t have to \t\t\t   be a genius to figure \t\t\t   that out...  \t\tThe dog stops, sniffing at a manicured lawn...  \n[164]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   It\u0092s as good a place as \t\t\t   any...  \t\tBut the dog keeps moving, pulling Jack with her.  \n[165]\t\t\t   ...but obviously not up \t\t\t   to your high standards... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Okay...he said you\u0092re \t\t\t   working on a new deal \t\t\t   now...fine, you\u0092ve done a \t\t\t   thousand deals, what\u0092s \t\t\t   the first thing you do?  \t\tLucy\u0092s sniffing around someone\u0092s Christmas display but \t\tJack\u0092s too wrapped up in his thought process to notice.  \n[166]\t\t\t   Triage.  It\u0092s your \t\t\t   signature.  You survey \t\t\t   the damage, find out \t\t\t   everything you can, you \t\t\t   probe, leave nothing to \t\t\t   chance.  I\u0092m just gonna \t\t\t   have to go detective. \t\t\t   How did you get \t\t\t   Mentadent?  You learned \t\t\t   everything there was to \t\t\t   know about toothpaste and \t\t\t   then you pounced...  \t\tJack narrows his eyes, thinking about that deal...  \n[167]\t\t\t   That\u0092s our play here...  \t\tResolute, Jack turns to the dog.  \n[168]\t\t\t   If you could take a dump \t\t\t   some time in this \t\t\t   century, then we could go \t\t\t   home where it\u0092s warm...  \t\tJack looks around at the unfamiliar houses...  \n[169]\t\t\t   That is if I can even \t\t\t   remember how to get \t\t\t   home... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   You remember, don\u0092t you \t\t\t   girl?  \t\tBut the dog ignores him, dragging Jack along...  \n[170]\t\t\t   Hello?  \t\tNo answer...  \n[171]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Hello!  \n[172]\t\t\t\t \n[173]\t\t\t   Uh...that baby\u0092s crying...  \n[174]\t\t\t   Pull tape...  \t\tJack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape, then \t\tgingerly pulls them apart, releasing the diaper from \t\tthe baby\u0092s bottom, and seeing what\u0092s inside.  \n[175]\t\t\t   Holy mother of god!  \t\tJack holds the diaper out away from him, searching for \t\ta place to put it.  Annie points to a Diaper Genie by \t\tthe dresser.  \t\tJack throws the diaper in, then quickly replaces the \t\tlid.  Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes.  \n[176]\t\t\t   You must be kidding...  \t\tAnnie stares at him a beat.  Then...  \n[177]\t\t\t   No, I\u0092m not.  \t\tA look of curiosity from Annie.  \n[178]\t\t\t   I work on Wall Street, \t\t\t   you know with the big \t\t\t   buildings...?  \t\tNo response from Annie...  \n[179]\t\t\t   I live in an apartment \t\t\t   house with a doorman, I \t\t\t   can buy just about \t\t\t   anything I want...  \t\tAnnie nods at Jack, still suspicious.  \n[180]\t\t\t   This isn\u0092t my real life. \t\t\t   It\u0092s just a glimpse...  \n[181]\t\t\t   I don\u0092t know...  \t\tA concerned look on Annie\u0092s face, Jack\u0092s petrified that \t\tshe\u0092s about to cry.  \n[182]\t\t\t   But don\u0092t worry, he loves \t\t\t   you and I\u0092m sure he\u0092ll be \t\t\t   back very soon... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...very, very soon...  \t\tAnnie approaches Jack, climbing up on a little chair \t\tand tugging firmly at his hair.  \n[183]\t\t\t   Who did?  \n[184]\t\t\t   Uhh...thanks...slightly \t\t\t   better looking though, \t\t\t   right?  \t\tAnnie\u0092s now stone faced, trying to decide about Jack.  \n[185]\t\t\t   You\u0092re not going to start \t\t\t   crying, are you?  Because \t\t\t   I\u0092m not really sure I \t\t\t   could deal with that \t\t\t   right now.  \t\tShe thinks about it for a moment.  \n[186]\t\t\t   On a case by case \t\t\t   basis...  \n[187]\t\t\t   I think I could figure it \t\t\t   out.  \n[188]\t\t\t   Sure.  \t\tBeat.  Then...a smile from Annie.  \n[189]\t\t\t   Check...  \t\tHe gets out of the van...  \n[190]\t\t\t   Do I get a receipt or \t\t\t   something...?  \t\tThe woman looks at Jack like he\u0092s crazy.  \n[191]\t\t\t   Five thirty.  Okay.  \n[192]\t\t\t   Got it.  Good tip.  \n[193]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Hey!  Annie!  \t\tAnnie turns back toward him.  \n[194]\t\t\t   Where do I go now?  \n[195]\t\t\t   Big Ed\u0092s?  Big Ed\u0092s \t\t\t   Tires? \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Why...?  \n[196]\t\t\t   You mean I sell tires...  \t\tShe shrugs her shoulders and walks off.  \n[197]\t\t\t   That\u0092s what I do.  I\u0092m a \t\t\t   tire salesman...  \n[198]\t\t\t   Good Lord...  \t\t...a huge, three-story-tall plastic likeness of Big Ed \t\tReynolds, ten gallon hat, lassoing a tire...  \n[199]\t\t\t   Uh...lemme get back to \t\t\t   you on that one... \t\t\t\t(looking at his \t\t\t\t name tag \t\t\t   Tommy...  \n[200]\t\t\t   I\u0092m gonna have to get \t\t\t   back to you on that...Ed.  \t\tBig Ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger, winking \t\tat Jack, then turns back to the activity at the counter \t\tas...  \t\tJack spots KENNY, a very young sales associate, walking \t\tby.  He reaches out and taps Kenny on the shoulder.  \n[201]\t\t\t   Do I have a private \t\t\t   office somewhere in the \t\t\t   building?  \n[202]\t\t\t   Thank you.  \t\tJack walks into the office with his name on the door...  \n[203] \t\tThere\u0092s no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or \t\tbar...it\u0092s small, cramped and cluttered, the walls \t\tlittered with tire inventory and price lists...  \t\tJack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.  \t\tHe makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of \t\tthe room and sits down behind it...  \t\tOn the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a \t\tplastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar \t\tand a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, \t\t\u0093Bowlers Do It In An Alley\u0094 embossed on its base...  \t\tHe surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top \t\tdrawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking \t\tinside...  \t\tHe sees the bottom line and winces, then puts it \t\tback...  \t\tJack picks up the \u0093Bowlers Do It In An Alley\u0094 figurine \t\tand gives it a good look...  \n[204]\t\t\t   Bowlers do it in an \t\t\t   alley?...Non profit \t\t\t   lawyers do it for free... \t\t\t   what is it with these \t\t\t   people?  Don\u0092t they \t\t\t   realize this refers to \t\t\t   sex?  \t\tHe replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer \t\twhere he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich.  He lifts it \t\tout...  \n[205]\t\t\t   At least you splurged on \t\t\t   some decent scotch...  \t\tHe takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot.  He \t\tdrinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the \t\tcup, throwing it toward the NET\u0092S basketball \t\thoop/garbage can near the door.  \t\tHe misses...  \t\tHe looks more closely at the photographs...most are \t\tfamily photos, a happy Jack with Kate, with Annie at \t\tthe pony rides, at Josh\u0092s birth...in every one of them, \t\tJack is smiling...  \n[206]\t\t\t\t(to Jack in \t\t\t\t the photo \t\t\t   What are you smiling \t\t\t   about...?  \t\tHe turns his head...spots a small plaque on the wall \t\tbehind him.  It reads, \u0093Jack Campbell - E.F. Hutton #1 \t\tJunior Sales Associate, 1988.\u0094  Jack raises an \t\teyebrow...  \n[207]\t\t\t   Number one...not bad.  \t\tHe grabs it off the wall and looks at it more \t\tcarefully...  \n[208] \t\t\t   1988...?  I was in London \t\t\t   in 1988...  \t\tJack\u0092s jarred into reality...  \n[209]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   You never went to London... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...you never got on that \t\t\t   plane...  \t\tHe stays there a moment...in shock.  Then...  \t\tThe P.A. system comes to life...  \n[210]\t\t\t   ...I was the number one \t\t\t   junior sales associate at \t\t\t   E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did \t\t\t   you know that?  \n[211]\t\t\t   That\u0092s the kind of thing \t\t\t   you can really build \t\t\t   on...  \n[212]\t\t\t   I mean sales has always \t\t\t   been a feeder for M and \t\t\t   A, always...  \t\tThey approach \u0093Mag Wheels\u0094 where TOMMY, a slick sales \t\tassociate, stands with a CUSTOMER looking at the \t\tdisplays...  \n[213]\t\t\t   Well, I\u0092m just a little \t\t\t   confused right now about \t\t\t   why I work here...  \t\tKenny looks at him nervously.  \n[214]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Do you know why do I work \t\t\t   here...?  \n[215]\t\t\t   I taught you the business?  \t\tAnother nod to the customer.  \n[216]\t\t\t   Everything I taught you. \t\t\t   I want to hear it all, \t\t\t   right now.  \t\tTommy\u0092s confused.  \n[217]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   What do you want?  \n[218]\t\t\t   Here.  These are great. \t\t\t   You\u0092ll need four.  \t\tThe customer takes the wheel from Jack, looks at it \t\tconfused...  \n[219]\t\t\t   Hey, you heard the guy, \t\t\t   I\u0092m the best damn tire \t\t\t   guy in the state of New \t\t\t   Jersey. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Everything.  \n[220] \t\tJack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the \t\tphone...  \n[221]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...I have no idea what \t\t\t   our inventory level is, \t\t\t   that\u0092s why I\u0092m asking \t\t\t   you...  \t\tA KNOCK at the door...  \n[222]\t\t\t   Look, just send us what \t\t\t   you sent us last month, \t\t\t   okay...?  And keep doing \t\t\t   that until further \t\t\t   notice...  \t\tHe hangs up the phone as the door opens.  Big Ed sticks \t\this head in...  \n[223]\t\t\t   I\u0092ve got all the time in \t\t\t   the world...  \t\tBig Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a \t\ttough looking man...  \n[224]\t\t\t   ...and a helluva bridge \t\t\t   player.  Ed\u0092s told me a \t\t\t   lot about you...  \t\tThey shake hands.  Potter nods his head at Jack, \t\timmediately impressed.  Big Ed is beaming.  \n[225]\t\t\t   I have no idea...  \t\tA surprised look from Potter.  An anxious laugh from \t\tBig Ed.  \n[226]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   I mean it.  From what I \t\t\t   can tell, we\u0092re a mom and \t\t\t   pop operation, we\u0092re \t\t\t   already over-extended in \t\t\t   sales, and any price \t\t\t   advantage we could offer \t\t\t   would easily be matched \t\t\t   by a larger supplier...  \t\tJack continues to stare down Potter.  \n[227]\t\t\t   So like I said, I don\u0092t \t\t\t   have any idea why you \t\t\t   should buy your parts \t\t\t   from us...  \t\tThe staring match continues.  Big Ed\u0092s getting more \t\tnervous.  Potter\u0092s the first to blink.  \n[228]\t\t\t   Except for rule number \t\t\t   one...  \t\tJack smiles.  \n[229]\t\t\t   The customer is always \t\t\t   right.  A clich\u00e9?  Sure. \t\t\t   The difference is, we \t\t\t   mean it.  We\u0092re small, we \t\t\t   need our customers.  We \t\t\t   can\u0092t afford to \t\t\t   disappoint them, ever. \t\t\t   Yeah, you could go to \t\t\t   some leviathan supplier, \t\t\t   probably save a few \t\t\t   pennies on the price of \t\t\t   oil filters, but with us \t\t\t   you get more than a \t\t\t   supplier, you get a \t\t\t   bridge partner...  \t\tA smile from Potter.  Jack gives Ed a wink.  Ed \t\twatches, thrilled...  \n[230]\t\t\t   You want to bid hearts, \t\t\t   we\u0092re right there with \t\t\t   you.  You feel the need \t\t\t   to redouble, you\u0092re not \t\t\t   going to get any argument \t\t\t   from us...  \t\tPotter nods at Jack.  Jack moves in for the kill.  \n[231]\t\t\t   The big guys may have the \t\t\t   high cards, but you know \t\t\t   as well as I do, Sydney, \t\t\t   high cards don\u0092t always \t\t\t   take the trick.  \t\tPotter pauses a minute, then...  \n[232]\t\t\t   A Lamaze class...!?  \n[233]\t\t\t   What?!  That\u0092s my deal?  \n[234]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Well that\u0092s just \t\t\t   great...those little \t\t\t   monkeys can be a real \t\t\t   handful...  \t\tKate shuts off the TV.  \n[235]\t\t\t   Hey!  I was watching \t\t\t   that!  \n[236]\t\t\t   I\u0092m working on a new deal \t\t\t   now...  \t\tKate throws a Kate Bush\u0092s \u0093The Sensual World\u0094 into the \t\tCD player.  \n[237]\t\t\t   Wait a second.  You want \t\t\t   me, don\u0092t you?  \n[238]\t\t\t   Shouldn\u0092t we grab some \t\t\t   dinner first?  Maybe a \t\t\t   bottle of wine...?  \n[239]\t\t\t   Whatever you say...honey.  \t\tShe starts kissing him again...but this time he just \t\tgoes with it, and as her hands run through his hair \t\the\u0092s brought back to a different time and place...  \t\tJack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...it\u0092s \t\tlike the first time he\u0092s really looked at her in eleven \t\tyears...   \n[240]\t\t\t   God...you\u0092re beautiful...  \t\tShe smiles at him, almost uncomfortable with the \t\tcompliment...  \n[241]\t\t\t   No, I\u0092m serious...you\u0092re \t\t\t   really stunning...  \n[242]\t\t\t   I mean back in college, \t\t\t   you were a very pretty \t\t\t   girl, there\u0092s no question \t\t\t   about that.  But this... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   ...you\u0092ve really grown \t\t\t   into a beautiful woman...  \t\tJack stares at her, entranced...Kate pulls back, \t\treacting to the intensity in his stare...  \n[243]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Do what?  \n[244]\t\t\tWhy don\u0092t we just go to \t\t\tall the stores?!  \t\tKate looks back at Jack.  \n[245]\t\t\tEvery single store in \t\t\tthis godforsaken shopping \t\t\tmall.  We can go to them \t\t\tall.  \t\tKate gives him a look.  Then...  \n[246]\t\t\tIt\u0092s an unbelievable \t\t\tthing.  Wearing this suit \t\t\tactually makes me feel \t\t\tlike a better person. \t\t\t\t(taking one final \t\t\t\t look \t\t\tI\u0092m gonna buy it...  \t\tKate raises an eyebrow, then looks at the price tag.  \n[247]\t\t\t\t(pointing to Annie\u0092s \t\t\t\t new Mary Janes \t\t\tShe got those shoes...  \n[248]\t\t\tNo.  \t\tKate looks at Jack, a little surprised.  \n[249]\t\t\tDo you have any idea what \t\t\tmy life is like?  \n[250]\t\t\tI wake up in the morning \t\t\tcovered in dog saliva...I \t\t\tdrop the kids off, spend \t\t\teight hours selling tires \t\t\tretail...retail, Kate.  \t\tKate just stands here, aghast...  \n[251]\t\t\tI pick up the kids, walk \t\t\tthe dog, which by the \t\t\tway, carries the added \t\t\tbonus of carting away her \t\t\tmonstrous crap...I play \t\t\twith the kids, take out \t\t\tthe garbage, get six \t\t\thours of sleep if I\u0092m \t\t\tlucky, and then it starts \t\t\tall over again...and why \t\t\tis it that I always have \t\t\tto drive everyone \t\t\teverywhere?  I spend \t\t\tpractically my entire day \t\t\tin that slow as hell \t\t\tmini-van listening to \t\t\tRaffi tapes and trying to \t\t\tfigure out how the cup \t\t\tholders work...I\u0092m sick \t\t\tof it.  \n[252]\t\t\tWhat\u0092s in it for me? \t\t\tWhere are my Mary Janes?  \t\tKate stares at him, shaking her head...  \n[253]\t\t\tI can\u0092t believe it\u0092s not \t\t\ta disappointment to you! \t\t\t\t \t\t\tJesus, Kate, I could\u0092ve \t\t\tbeen a thousand times the \t\t\tman I became.  How could \t\t\tyou do this to me?  How \t\t\tcould you let me give up \t\t\ton my dreams like this?!  \t\tKate stares at him in disbelief.  Then...  \n[254]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tLook, I\u0092m sorry.  I\u0092m \t\t\tsorry I was such a saint \t\t\tbefore and I\u0092m such a \t\t\tprick now.  Maybe I\u0092m \t\t\tjust not the same guy I \t\t\twas when we got \t\t\tmarried...  \n[255]\t\t\tForget it... \t\t\t\t(taking off the \t\t\t\t jacket \t\t\tWe\u0092ll get a funnel cake. \t\t\tIt\u0092ll be the highlight of \t\t\tmy week...  \n[256]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tListen, I\u0092m sorry about \t\t\tthat back in the store. \t\t\tI really don\u0092t want to \t\t\tfight with you...  \t\tKate just keeps looking out the window.  \n[257]\t\t\tBut you must sometimes \t\t\twonder how we ended up \t\t\there.  I mean back in \t\t\tcollege, did you see \t\t\tus... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t...here...?  \t\tShe turns to him.  \n[258]\t\t\tIt really has, hasn\u0092t \t\t\tit?

Jack takes her in his \t\tarms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, \t\tconfident and self-assured.  \t\tThe pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role \t\tin this romantic moment.  \t\tKate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably. \t\tThey look good together...in sync with each other...  \t\tPeople are watching them...some of the men are \t\timpressed, others are scoffing, but the women are \t\tclearly charmed...  \n[344]\t\t\tI have my moments...  \t\tThey continue to dance, in a world of their own...  \n[345]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tGod I missed that \t\t\ttaste...  \t\tKate laughs.  \n[346]\t\t\tWhy are you laughing?  \t\tKate shoots him a look of curiosity.

Ten \t\t\tdays, two weeks tops, \t\t\tthey would\u0092ve approached \t\t\tyou with an offer, and \t\t\tI\u0092d bet anything it \t\t\twould\u0092ve been thirty \t\t\tbillion, not twenty \t\t\tnine... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tProblem was, Peter, you \t\t\thad a pussycat running \t\t\tthe show. What you needed \t\t\twas a rottweiler.  \t\tLassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, \t\tan intrigued look on his face...  \n[380]\t\t\tSure. We\u0092re going to \t\t\thave to special order \t\t\tthat tire. It\u0092ll be \t\t\tready in about two days.  \t\tLassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his \t\twallet.  \n[381] \t\tKate, sound asleep in bed...  \t\tPan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in \t\tthought...  \n[382] \t\tJack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, \t\tdistracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the \n[383]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHector...do I usually \t\t\tlisten to your personal \t\t\tproblems?  \n[384]\t\t\tLook, I have some business \t\t\tthat I have to take care \t\t\tof in the city so I\u0092m \t\t\tleaving early... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tMy advice to you...follow \t\t\tyour dreams.  \n[385]\t\t\tBut you\u0092re not interested \t\t\tin boutique dollars... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI get it...  \t\tThey walk into...  \n[386]\t\t\t\t(appropriately \t\t\t\t deferential \t\t\tMr. Mintz.  \n[387]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI can see that, Alan.  \t\tA chuckle from Mintz.  \n[388]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tUh...actually, yes. Two... \t\t\tgood ones.  \t\tAnother laugh from Mintz.  \n[389]\t\t\tI was a sales associate, \t\t\tat E.F. Hutton.  \n[390]\t\t\tThat\u0092s right. And auto \t\t\tsupply...  \n[391]\t\t\tUh...we actually get about \t\t\tsixty percent of our \t\t\tbusiness from automotive \t\t\tservice.  \n[392]\t\t\tWe did one point seven \t\t\tmillion in total revenue...  \n[393]\t\t\tWell, Alan, I think we\u0092re \t\t\tgonna have a banner year. \t\t\tSales are up almost \t\t\ttwenty percent in the \t\t\tfirst quarter and we just \t\t\tlanded a major trucking \t\t\tcompany account.  \n[394]\t\t\tThat\u0092s right. And that \t\t\twould make us number one \t\t\tin our market... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou mind if I stand?  \t\tA raised eyebrow from Mintz.  \t\tMintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he \t\tcrosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of \t\twater...  \n[395]\t\t\tLook, I know our paltry \t\t\tlittle two million in \t\t\tsales is about what you \t\t\tspend on office supplies \t\t\tin a year.  And I know \t\t\tsome regional trucking \t\t\tcompany account is \t\t\tnothing compared to a \t\t\tsixty billion dollar \t\t\tmerger...  \n[396]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt\u0092s okay, Alan. I get it. \t\t\tI\u0092m in your shoes, I\u0092m \t\t\tthinking exactly the same \t\t\tthing...but here\u0092s the \t\t\tthing. Business is \t\t\tbusiness.  Wall Street, \t\t\tMain Street, it\u0092s all \t\t\tjust a bunch of people \t\t\tgetting up in the morning, \t\t\ttrying to figure out how \t\t\tthe hell they\u0092re gonna \t\t\tsend their kids to \t\t\tcollege.  It\u0092s just \t\t\tpeople...  \t\tJack\u0092s confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter \t\tappears intrigued...  \n[397]\t\t\tAnd I know people.  \n[398]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tTake you, for instance...  \n[399]\t\t\tYou drink about sixteen \t\t\tDiet Cokes a day. You\u0092re \t\t\tan excellent father, but \t\t\tyou feel guilty about the \t\t\ttime you spend away from \t\t\thome. You drink bourbon, \t\t\tbut you offer your \t\t\tclients scotch...  \t\tJack looks around the office then back to Mintz.  \n[400]\t\t\tAnd your wife decorated \t\t\tthis office...  \t\tA laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing, a \t\tcaught look on his face.  \n[401]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou\u0092re a little tougher, \t\t\tPeter.  \t\tA raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but he\u0092s game...  \n[402]\t\t\tFor one thing, you like \t\t\texpensive things.  \n[403]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tOkay...you smoke Hoyo de \t\t\tMonterreys. You\u0092re a \t\t\tscotch man, single malt, \t\t\tnot because it\u0092s trendy \t\t\tbut because you\u0092ve been \t\t\tdoing it for forty years, \t\t\tand you stay with what \t\t\tworks. You have two great \t\t\tloves in your life, your \t\t\thorses and this company. \t\t\tYou wept openly the day \t\t\tthe Dow hit ten thousand...  \t\tLassiter\u0092s impressed.  \n[404]\t\t\tAnd you\u0092re a man who \t\t\tprides himself on finding \t\t\ttalent in unusual \t\t\tplaces...   \n[405]\t\t\tBecause I\u0092m here.  \t\tOn Lassiter...nodding his head. Mintz, a plastered-on \t\tsmile.  \n[406]\t\t\tI\u0092m prepared to do \t\t\tanything it takes to get \t\t\tthis job. Start anywhere \t\t\tyou need me to start. \t\t\tI\u0092ll park cars if I \t\t\tto... \t\t\t\t(into Lassiter\u0092s \t\t\t\t eyes \t\t\tThe biggest part of \t\t\tjudging character is \t\t\tknowing yourself. And I \t\t\tknow this, I can do this \t\t\tjob. Give me a chance, \t\t\tPeter, I won\u0092t let you \t\t\tdown.  \t\tLassiter returns Jack\u0092s gaze with equal intensity. In a \t\tmoment, he turns to Mintz.  \n[407]\t\t\t\t(not particularly \t\t\t\t impressed \t\t\tSeven.  Really.  \t\tThey turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of \t\tthe corridor.  \t\tMintz stops, turning to Jack.  Jack returns Mintz\u0092s \t\tgaze with a quizzical look.  \n[408]\t\t\tGod, you really are \t\t\tdifferent, aren\u0092t you... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI mean...wow...I am \t\t\timpressed.  \t\tNow it\u0092s Mintz\u0092s turn to look quizzical.  \n[409]\t\t\tGood for you. Why shouldn\u0092t \t\t\tyou protect what\u0092s yours.  \n[410]\t\t\tOh, I\u0092m hearing you, Alan. \t\t\tThat\u0092s not the problem. \t\t\tThe problem is that what \t\t\tyou think is yours, is \t\t\treally mine.  And I don\u0092t \t\t\tcare how low on the totem \t\t\tpole I start, I will get \t\t\tit back... \t\t\t\t(poking him in \t\t\t\t the chest \t\t\tSo do yourself a favor and \t\t\tdon\u0092t get too attached to \t\t\tthat view because sometime \t\t\tsoon, maybe very soon, you \t\t\tand your French country \t\t\tantiques, your chintz sofa, \t\t\tand your little play pen \t\t\tare gonna be moving out of \t\t\tthat office.  \t\tJack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns...  \n[411]\t\t\tOh, and by the way, you \t\t\ttry selling tires for a \t\t\tliving.  I promise you, \t\t\tyou\u0092d starve.  \t\tJack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, \t\tleaving Mintz standing there, bewildered.  \n[412]\t\t\tWelcome to Xanadu...  \t\tThe place is incredible...marble floors, architectural \t\tlines, high tech fixtures, elegant modern furniture... \t\tit\u0092s striking but not at all homey like the Jersey \t\thouse.  \n[413]\t\t\tPretty incredible, isn\u0092t \t\t\tit?  \n[414]\t\t\tThink bigger.  \n[415]\t\t\tThis place is a perk, \t\t\tKate.  \n[416]\t\t\tA company called P.K. \t\t\tLassiter and Associates \t\t\tInvestment House uses it \t\t\tto attract new \t\t\texecutives...  \t\tKate\u0092s confused.  \n[417]\t\t\tYou\u0092re talking to their \t\t\tnew Vice President of \t\t\tMergers and Acquisitions.  \n[418]\t\t\tI\u0092m going into arbitrage, \t\t\thoney.  Turns out I have \t\t\ta knack for it.  I\u0092ll be \t\t\tmaking two hundred grand \t\t\ta year plus a hefty bonus \t\t\tand that\u0092s just to \t\t\tstart.  And, we can live \t\t\tin this apartment \t\t\tpractically rent free for \t\t\tas long as we want.  \t\tJack measures her reaction. It\u0092s not good...  \n[419]\t\t\tWe can finally afford to \t\t\tmove back into the city. \t\t\tIn style.  \t\tKate just looks at him, in shock. Then...  \n[420]\t\t\tI don\u0092t think so. This \t\t\tis going to be a better \t\t\tlife for all of us, \t\t\thoney.  We\u0092ll put Annie \t\t\tand Josh in private \t\t\tschools...  \n[421]\t\t\tI\u0092m talking about the \t\t\tbest schools in the \t\t\tcountry here, Kate...  \n[422]\t\t\tThis is New York City, \t\t\tit\u0092s like the needy \t\t\tpeople capital of the \t\t\tworld.  Those Jersey \t\t\tclients of yours aren\u0092t a \t\t\ttenth as pathetic as the \t\t\tones you could get \t\t\there...  \n[423]\t\t\tNo, this is the center of \t\t\tthe universe.  If I were \t\t\tliving in Roman times, I \t\t\twould live in Rome, where \t\t\telse?  Today, America is \t\t\tthe Roman Empire and New \t\t\tYork is Rome itself. \t\t\tJohn Lennon.  \n[424]\t\t\tLook, I\u0092m detecting a \t\t\tkind of funky tension \t\t\there...We don\u0092t have to \t\t\tlive in this apartment. \t\t\tI don\u0092t need this...I\u0092ll \t\t\tcommute...I\u0092ll drive to \t\t\twork...  \t\tJack\u0092s back on his heels...seeing his dream picked \t\tapart...  \n[425]\t\t\tKate. You\u0092re not \t\t\tunderstanding me. I\u0092m \t\t\ttalking about a great \t\t\tlife.  A perfect life. \t\t\tEverything we pictured \t\t\twhen we were young. The \t\t\twhole package. You said \t\t\tit yourself, life has \t\t\tthrown us surprises, and \t\t\tso we made sacrifices. \t\t\tBut now I can finally get \t\t\tus back on track...  \t\tA sad chuckle from Kate.  \n[426]\t\t\tI can do that.  I want to \t\t\tdo that.  For all of us. \t\t\tI need to do that as a \t\t\tman... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThink about it.  No more \t\t\tlousy restaurants, no \t\t\tmore clipping coupons, no \t\t\tmore shoveling snow...  \n[427]\t\t\tLook, you\u0092re making this \t\t\tinto something it\u0092s not. \t\t\tThis isn\u0092t a referendum \t\t\ton our lives, Kate. It\u0092s \t\t\ta step forward... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tDon\u0092t you see?  I\u0092m \t\t\ttalking about us finally \t\t\thaving a life other \t\t\tpeople envy.  \t\tSilence.  Kate looks him in the eye \u0096 a deep, piercing \t\tlook...  \n[428]\t\t\tVery nice. What is it?  \n[429]\t\t\tAh. A classic...  \t\tAnnie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the \t\tdresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and \t\tdown its sides...  \t\tJack studies them...in every one Jack\u0092s face is totally \t\tcontented.  Jack studies them, looking at his own face.  \t\tAnnie lowers the bow, watching him...  \t\tJack turns to her.  \n[430]\t\t\tPlease don\u0092t stop...  \t\tShe smiles, then starts PLAYING again.  He turns back \t\tto the pictures...  \n[431]\t\t\tFrom London to New York...? \t\t\t\t \t\t\tI came back...  \t\tThen...a NOISE...  \t\tJack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, \t\tstanding there...She sees Jack holding the Pan Am \t\tticket sleeve.  \n[432]\t\t\tWhat are you doing?  \n[433]\t\t\tFour ninety nine?! It\u0092s just \t\t\tsalt for god\u0092s sake...  \t\tOn the entrance to the store...the door opens, a YOUNG \t\tGIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager...  \t\tShe glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package \t\tof gum...  \t\tFrom the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach \t\tthe counter...  \t\tOn Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of \t\tsalt from the shelf, when...  \n[434]\t\t\tYou...!  \t\tThen...the color drains from Jack\u0092s face...  \n[435]\t\t\tWhat are you doing here...  \t\tJack moves toward Cash at the counter...  \n[436]\t\t\tYou\u0092re not sending me \t\t\tback...  \t\tThe girl eyes Jack curiously, then removes a dollar \t\tbill from her pocket and slides it across the counter \t\tto Cash...  \n[437]\t\t\tI\u0092m not going back...  \t\tThe girl hesitates...Cash turns to her...  \n[438]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHey! Did you hear me...?!  \t\tCash ignores Jack, watching the girl as she heads to \t\tthe door, hesitates a moment, then walks out...  \t\tA look of disappointment on Cash\u0092s face as he reaches \t\tinto his pocket, pulling out a little notebook...  \t\tCash looks at Jack.  \n[439]\t\t\tHey, I\u0092m talking to you! \t\t\tI am not going back, do you \t\t\tunderstand...?!  \t\tCash looks at him, compassion on his face.  \n[440]\t\t\tYou can\u0092t do this. You \t\t\tcan\u0092t keep coming in and \t\t\tout of people\u0092s lives, \t\t\tmessing things up...  \n[441]\t\t\tI\u0092ve got kids, I\u0092m going \t\t\thome...  \n[442]\t\t\t\t(pointing at \t\t\t\t Cash \t\t\tI\u0092m staying.  \t\tCash follows him with his eyes, a proud look on Cash\u0092s \t\tface as Jack leaves...  \n[443]\t\t\tNo, honey. Go back to \t\t\tsleep.  \t\tShe closes her eyes as Jack stands there for a moment \t\tlooking at her, sadness all over his face.  \n[444]\t\t\tTake care of yourself, \t\t\tAnnie.  I\u0092m going back to \t\t\tthe mother ship...  \t\tFinally, he turns to go...  \n[445]\t\t\tThese last weeks, Kate, I \t\t\tknow that I\u0092ve done \t\t\tsome...some unusual \t\t\tthings.  \t\tKate nods.  \n[446]\t\t\tBut I\u0092ve done some good \t\t\tthings too, haven\u0092t I?  \n[447]\t\t\tI need you to remember \t\t\tme, Kate.  How I am right \t\t\tnow, right this very \t\t\tmoment.  I need you to \t\t\tput that image in your \t\t\theart and keep it with \t\t\tyou, no matter what \t\t\thappens.  \n[448]\t\t\tPlease, just promise me \t\t\tyou\u0092ll do that. You have \t\t\tto promise, Kate. \t\t\tBecause if you don\u0092t, \t\t\tthen it\u0092s like it never \t\t\thappened and I don\u0092t \t\t\tthink I could live with \t\t\tthat.  \t\tShe\u0092s a bit confused but she couldn\u0092t be more in love \t\twith him.  \n[449]\t\t\tPromise me again...  \n[450]\t\t\tSoon...  \n[451] \n[452]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYeah...okay, send her \t\t\tup...  \t\tHe drops the phone...turns back over...let\u0092s his eyes \t\tstay closed for another moment...then...  \t\tHis eyes open...  \t\tHe looks around...sees his shirtless torso...then his \t\told apartment...tailored clothes on the floor.  \n[453]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tDamnit.  \t\tJack looks at the clock, \u00939:23 a.m.\u0094  He gets out of \t\tbed, throwing on pants and a pair of shoes, and leaves \t\tthe room...  \n[454] \t\t...Jack walks to the door just as...  \t\tThe doorbell RINGS.  He stops, then cautiously opens \t\tthe door, seeing...  \t\tPAULA, wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her \t\tface.  \n[455]\t\t\tPaula...  \t\tPaula opens her coat \u0096 the only thing she has on \t\tunderneath is a sexy little teddy.  \n[456]\t\t\t\t(momentarily \t\t\t\t  distracted \t\t\tThat\u0092s totally see through...  \n[457]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tChristmas?  It can\u0092t be \t\t\tChristmas...  \t\tJack stares at her, totally confused...  \n[458]\t\t\tIs Kate here? Does Kate live \t\t\there?!  \n[459]\t\t\tDamn...damn...damn...  \n[460]\t\t\tNo...I\u0092m not...  \n[461]\t\t\tI\u0092m sorry, no...  \t\tJack walks off, beleaguered...  \n[462]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tIt\u0092s me, Jack...  \n[463]\t\t\tTell me you recognize me, \t\t\tArnie.

We\u0092re \t\t\tbowlers ...we won a \t\t\tchampionship...we\u0092re winners.  \n[465]\t\t\tYes...Jack Campbell...  \n[466]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tYes, that\u0092s it...yes, we \t\t\twent to high school together.  \n[467]\t\t\tYeah...I guess I just \t\t\twanted you to know, we \t\t\tcould\u0092ve been really good \t\t\tfriends...  \n[468]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tHello?  \n[469]\t\t\tAdelle?  \n[470]\t\t\tI\u0092ll be there in twenty \t\t\tminutes...  \n[471]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWhat\u0092s going on here?  \n[472]\t\t\tYou know something, Alan. \t\t\tThere\u0092s a much more assertive \t\t\tperson somewhere inside of \t\t\tyou...  \t\tAlan looks at him, confused.  \n[473]\t\t\tBut I think I like you better \t\t\tthis way...  \n[474]\t\t\tNo.  \n[475]\t\t\tI\u0092ll tell you exactly what \t\t\twe\u0092re going to do.  You\u0092re \t\t\tgoing to do whatever you \t\t\thave to do to find out which \t\t\tEuropean company he\u0092s been \t\t\ttalking to.  Then I\u0092m going \t\t\tto clean myself up, fly to \t\t\tAspen, and drink egg nog \t\t\twith Bob Thomas.  His wife \t\t\tand kids will be playing in \t\t\tthe background while I spend \t\t\tChristmas day convincing him \t\t\tthat the European company is \t\t\tthe devil and Global is the \t\t\tanswer to his prayers, after \t\t\tall... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tThen I\u0092m going to spend four \t\t\thours skiing.

I\u0092m going \t\t\tto do that because that is \t\t\tmy life, that is what\u0092s \t\t\treal, and there is nothing \t\t\tI can do to change that...  \t\tJack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his \t\tteam.  \n[476]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tFor Manhattan...Kate \t\t\tReynolds...I need an address \t\t\ttoo...  \t\tJack jots something down on a business card.  Then he \t\thangs up the phone, thinks a moment, looks out the \t\twindow, then turns to the driver...  \n[477]\t\t\tMake a right here...  \n[478]\t\t\tWe\u0092re not going to the \t\t\tairport...  \n[479]\t\t\tI\u0092m Jack Campbell...I\u0092m an \t\t\told... friend of Kate\u0092s. \t\t\tI just called.  \t\tThe woman looks at him, then walks back inside...  \n[480]\t\t\tKate...  \n[481]\t\t\tYou look great.  \n[482]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tI'm sorry...  \n[483]\t\t\tWhat\u0092s going on?  \n[484]\t\t\tParis?  \n[485]\t\t\tYou\u0092re moving...  \n[486]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tTo Paris.

Then she sees he\u0092s not \t\tlaughing...  \n[491]\t\t\tSure. Goodbye, Kate.  \t\tHe leaves...  \n[492] \t\tA scratchy Zeppelin album, the song \u0093All Of My Love,\u0094 \t\tfills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmill\u0092s by his \t\tside, goes through the box Kate gave him.  \t\tHe removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft \t\tmaterial, then a \u0093Mondale for President\u0094 button, which \t\tJack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert \t\tticket stubs...  \t\tHe puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale \t\tbutton on the lapel.  He digs back into the box, \t\tfinding...  \t\tA messy, dog-eared copy of \u0093Cat\u0092s Cradle\u0094...not the one \t\tKate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...  \t\tJack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... \t\tthen...  \t\tHe looks over at the clock, it reads, \u00938:29.\u0094  \n[493]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tKate!  \t\tKate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her \t\tface.  \n[494]\t\t\tYou can\u0092t go!  \n[495]\t\t\tDon\u0092t get on that plane!  \n[496]\t\t\tPlease.

I\u0092m sure \t\t\tthere\u0092s another flight to \t\t\tParis tonight.  \n[497]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe have a house in Jersey!  \t\tKate turns to him with a look that could kill.  \n[498]\t\t\tWe have two kids, Annie and \t\t\tJosh...  \t\t...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half- \t\tinterested...  \n[499]\t\t\t...Annie\u0092s not much of a \t\t\tviolin player but she \t\t\ttries really hard. She\u0092s a \t\t\tlittle precocious but that\u0092s \t\t\tonly because she says what\u0092s \t\t\ton her mind. And when she \t\t\tsmiles...  \t\tJack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the \t\ttears...  \n[500]\t\t\tAnd Josh...he has your eyes. \t\t\tHe doesn\u0092t say much but we \t\t\tknow he\u0092s smart... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t...he\u0092s always got his eyes \t\t\topen, always watching us... \t\t\tsometimes you can look at \t\t\thim and just know that he\u0092s \t\t\tlearning something new... \t\t\tit\u0092s like witnessing a \t\t\tmiracle...  \t\tKate\u0092s expression has sifted from annoyance to \t\tcuriosity.  \n[501]\t\t\t...the house is a mess, but \t\t\tit\u0092s ours... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t...well, after a hundred \t\t\ttwenty two more payments \t\t\tit will be...  \t\tJack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of \t\tthe airport going on around him, Jack not caring...  \n[502]\t\t\tAnd you...you\u0092re a non- \t\t\tprofit lawyer. That\u0092s right, \t\t\tcompletely non-profit. But \t\t\tthat doesn\u0092t seem to bother \t\t\tyou...  \t\tKate raises an eyebrow. It\u0092s something she\u0092s thought \t\tabout.  \n[503]\t\t\tAnd we\u0092re in love. After \t\t\tthirteen years of marriage \t\t\twe\u0092re still unbelievably \t\t\tin love... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tYou won\u0092t even let me touch \t\t\tyou until I\u0092ve said it...  \t\tJack gets closer and closer...Kate\u0092s spellbound now... \t\timagining the picture Jack\u0092s painting...  \n[504]\t\t\t...I sing to you...not all \t\t\tthe time but definitely on \t\t\tspecial occasions...  \t\tJack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a \t\trow of passengers...  \n[505]\t\t\t\t \t\t\tExcuse me... \t\t\t\t \t\t\tWe made a lot of sacrifices, \t\t\tdealt with our share of \t\t\tsurprises, but we stayed \t\t\ttogether...  \t\tJack\u0092s nearly there...  \n[506]\t\t\tYou see, you\u0092re a better \t\t\tperson than I am...  \t\tNot in this life, and Kate knows it...  \n[507]\t\t\t...and it made me a better \t\t\tperson to be around you...  \t\tKate is perfectly still, Jack\u0092s words echoing in her \t\tears.  \n[508]\t\t\tMaybe it was all a \t\t\tdream. Maybe I went to \t\t\tbed one lonely night in \t\t\tDecember and imagined it \t\t\tall. But I swear, \t\t\tnothing\u0092s ever felt more \t\t\treal to me...  \t\tHe\u0092s right in front of her. She can\u0092t take her eyes \t\toff him.  \n[509]\t\t\tAnd if you get on that \t\t\tplane right now, it\u0092ll \t\t\tdisappear forever.  \t\tSilence.

He gently touches a \t\thand to her arm...  \n[511]\t\t\tPlease, Kate, one cup of \t\t\tcoffee. You can always go \t\t\tto Paris. Just please, not \t\t\ttonight...  \t\tShe stands there, frozen, staring into Jack\u0092s eyes, \t\tsearching for the answer.  ", "Cash": "\n[1]\t\t\t   Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's \t\t\t   a certified winner...paper- \t\t\t   thin but good as gold...  \t\tJack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy.  \t\tJack approaches Sam Wong at the counter.  \n[2]\t\t\t\t(in the b.g., to \t\t\t\t Sam Wong \t\t\t   Y'all do the lotto here...? \t\t\t   `Cause I got me a winner...I \t\t\t   know, I know, Lotto keeps the \t\t\t   black man down... but not \t\t\t   me...  \t\tJack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash \t\thanding Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward \t\tthe counter...  \n[3]\t\t\t   ...06...14...18...48...right \t\t\t   there.

You got \t\t\t   plenty of time.  \n[45]\t\t\t   As long as it takes to \t\t\t   figure it out.  Which, in \t\t\t   your case, could be \t\t\t   considerable.  \n[46]\t\t\t   Do I look like I need \t\t\t   your money.  It doesn\u0092t \t\t\t   work like that and I \t\t\t   can\u0092t tell you why.  \n[47]\t\t\t   Because you got to figure \t\t\t   it out for yourself. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Are you listening to me?  \n[48]\t\t\t   Look Jack, in my \t\t\t   experience the best way \t\t\t   people deal with this is \t\t\t   to just relax and breathe \t\t\t   through it...let it come \t\t\t   to you.  \t\tJack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.  \n[49]\t\t\t   Oh you\u0092re working on a \t\t\t   new deal now...did I \t\t\t   mention that?  \n[50]\t\t\t   Here...  \t\tJack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE \t\tBELL.

That circus \t\t\tact back there may have \t\t\tdazzled Lassiter \t\t\tmomentarily but it \t\t\tdoesn\u0092t do shit forme. \t\t\tEven if you get this job, \t\t\twhich I highly doubt, let \t\t\tme warn you, Lassiter \t\t\tloses interest in his pet \t\t\tprojects very quickly. \t\t\tI\u0092m in the big office \t\t\tbecause I\u0092ve proved \t\t\tmyself to him year after \t\t\tyear and nobody is going \t\t\tto come in here and start \t\t\tturning the old man\u0092s \t\t\thead. Especially not some \t\t\ttire salesman from New \t\t\tJersey. So you watch \t\t\tyourself and stay away \t\t\tfrom Lassiter, and maybe, \t\t\tjust maybe, I\u0092ll keep you \t\t\ton after he gets tired of \t\t\tyou.

You \t\t\t   don\u0092t need to hear \t\t\t   that... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   All I meant was a lot of \t\t\t   people have a hard time \t\t\t   dealing with all the \t\t\t   forced reverie, that\u0092s \t\t\t   all.

She\u0092s mad enough \t\t\t   as it is, right...?  \n[17] \t\tArnie walks Jack through his backyard...  \n[18]\t\t\t   Look, you fit the profile \t\t\t   exactly.  Thirties, \t\t\t   house, kids, financial \t\t\t   responsibilities.  You \t\t\t   start thinking...this \t\t\t   isn\u0092t the life I dreamt \t\t\t   about.  Where\u0092s the \t\t\t   romance, where\u0092s the joie \t\t\t   de vivre?

A little \t\t\tflirtation\u0092s harmless but \t\t\tyou\u0092re playing with fire \t\t\there.  The Fidelity Bank \t\t\tand Trust is a tough \t\t\tcreditor.

Why don\u0092t you \t\t\t   take your own damn car!  \n[7]\t\t\t   He\u0092s got a perfectly good \t\t\t   mini-van sitting out \t\t\t   there in the driveway!  \t\tJack grabs the keys off the hook...darts back outside...  \n[8] \t\tJack approaches Big Ed\u0092s from the parking lot...slowly, \t\ttaking it all in...  \t\tIt\u0092s like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.  A big retail \t\tstore for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for \t\teverything from alignments to brake jobs...  \t\tJack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a \t\tGuatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands \t\twith TOMMY the salesman.  \n[9] \t\tJack walks in...looks around...the store is teeming \t\twith activity, a post-holiday sale in progress...  \t\tBig Ed, in his signature ten gallon hat, sees Jack from \t\tbehind the counter...  \n[10]\t\t\t   Jack my boy!  You are \t\t\t   looking mighty worse for \t\t\t   the wear...Hey, guess who \t\t\t   I played bridge with two \t\t\t   nights ago...?  \t\tJack stares blankly at Big Ed...  \n[11]\t\t\t   Hell, you\u0092ll never \t\t\t   guess.  One Sydney \t\t\t   Potter.  That\u0092s Sydney \t\t\t   Potter, Chief Executive \t\t\t   Officer of BuyRite \t\t\t   Transport.  Only the \t\t\t   third largest trucking \t\t\t   company in the state.  I \t\t\t   even let the sonuvabitch \t\t\t   win, which wasn\u0092t easy \t\t\t   because the guy\u0092s been \t\t\t   bashed in the head by \t\t\t   Teamsters so many times \t\t\t   his brain\u0092s like \t\t\t   porridge.  Anyhoo, he\u0092s \t\t\t   looking for a new parts \t\t\t   supplier... we can handle \t\t\t   that kind of volume, \t\t\t   right?  \t\tJack considers this briefly.  \n[12] \t\tKenny leading Jack toward the \u0093Mag Wheels\u0094 section.  \n[13] \t\tJack is behind his desk, his tie loosened, on the \t\tphone...  \n[14]\t\t\t   Got a minute, Jack?  \n[15]\t\t\t   Jack, meet Sydney Potter, \t\t\t   BuyRite Transport, one of \t\t\t   Jersey\u0092s top \t\t\t   businessmen...  \t\tPotter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, \t\ttrying to place the name.  Then...  \n[16]\t\t\t   My daughter\u0092s no slouch \t\t\t   either...  \t\tA smile from Potter, then a serious look.  \n[17]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   C\u0092mon Jack...  \n[18]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   That\u0092s my boy... \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   C\u0092mon, lemme show you the \t\t\t   rest of the ranch...  \t\tBig Ed and Potter exit the office...  \n[19]\t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Nice shootin\u0092, Jack...  \t\t...leaving Jack there with a satisfied smile on his \t\tface.  \n[20] \t\tJack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with \t\ta MAN  wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair \t\tof high top Nike Air Jordans.  \n[21] \t\t...but he\u0092s still focused on Lassiter through the \t\twindow, can\u0092t take his eyes off him...  \t\tHe gets to the phone...sees the light for line two \t\tblinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach \t\tLassiter...  \t\t...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the \t\tphone...  \t\tBut can\u0092t bring himself to hit the blinking light. \t\tThen...  \n[22] \t\t...towards Kenny and Lassiter.  \n[23] \t\tJack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his \t\tcluttered, cramped office.  \n[24] \t\tJack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, \t\tdistracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the ", "Ed": "\n[1] \n[2] \t\t...impeccably decorated and obsessively neat.  \t\tClose in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans \t\tmustache and long hair, opens his eyes. \t\tA FLASH of bright morning light from the window.  Jack \t\tshields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom \t\twhere he sees...  \t\tA WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible \t\tback, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully \t\tcurved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman \t\tturns to him...  \t\tPAULA.  Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her \t\tmouth...  \n[3] \n[4] \t\tJack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...  \n[5] \t\tClose in on Jack\u0092s face, bathed in morning light...he \t\topens his eyes...feels something strange...  \t\tJack looks down...there\u0092s a woman\u0092s head resting on his \t\tchest.  \t\tA look of confusion crosses his face...trying to \t\tremember... did he meet a woman last night...?  \t\tHe turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting \t\tfaithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...  \t\t...did she have a dog?  \t\tHe looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to \t\tget a look at her face.  And then he sees her...  \n[6]\t\t\t   Jack you ol\u0092 bird dog. \t\t\t   Merry Christmas to ya\u0092...  \t\tLorraine plants a big fat kiss on Jack\u0092s cheek.  \n[7]\t\t\t   I heard that.  This is \t\t\t   who I am, woman! \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Tell her, Jack!  You\u0092re \t\t\t   the only one who gets me, \t\t\t   for god\u0092s sake!  \t\tJack, still holding the door open, plotting his escape.  \n[8]\t\t\t   \u0091Course you do.  Hell, \t\t\t   it\u0092s almost 8 a.m. \t\t\t\t \t\t\t   Where are my two l\u0092il \t\t\t   pardners?  Annie!

He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.  \t\tHe takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly \t\ton the chair.  He looks over at the pair of flannel \t\tpajamas folded on the dresser.  He shakes his head, \t\tresigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...  \n[15] \t\tMorning light streams into the room.  The clock reads, \t\t\u00937:14.\u0094  \t\tJack opens his eyes \u0096 a burst of light hitting them \t\tfrom the window...like the morning light in his \t\tManhattan loft...  \t\tHe reaches across the bed...it\u0092s empty...  \t\tA smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on \t\tthe pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...  \t\tThe sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A \t\tpained look on Jack\u0092s face as he realizes he\u0092s still in \t\tJersey.  \t\tNow the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, \t\thoping it\u0092ll stop...it doesn\u0092t.  Then, he hears the \t\tsound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.  \t\tHe gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...  \n[16] \t\tJack approaches Big Ed\u0092s from the parking lot...slowly, \t\ttaking it all in...  \t\tIt\u0092s like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme.

Jack pushes the dog \t\taway...as...  \t\tThe ALARM RINGS.  Kate pushes the button to stop it.  \n[30] \t\t...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on \t\tthe bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide \t\tsmile on her face.  \t\tJack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift.  He looks \t\tbehind, as if to ask whether it\u0092s for him, then back to \t\tKate.  \n[31] \t\tAnnie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get \t\tdressed.  \t\tKate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet \t\tcarrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy \t\tlittle black one.  \t\tKate holds out the two dresses to Annie.  \n[32] \n[33] \t\tJack, pointing to a stack of radials, is standing with \t\ta MAN  wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair \t\tof high top Nike Air Jordans.  \n[34] \t\t...but he\u0092s still focused on Lassiter through the \t\twindow, can\u0092t take his eyes off him...  \t\tHe gets to the phone...sees the light for line two \t\tblinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach \t\tLassiter...  \t\t...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the \t\tphone...  \t\tBut can\u0092t bring himself to hit the blinking light. \t\tThen...  \n[35] \t\t...towards Kenny and Lassiter.  \n[36] \t\tJack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his \t\tcluttered, cramped office.  \n[37] \t\tKate, sound asleep in bed...  \t\tPan across to Jack, his eyes wide open, lost in \t\tthought...  \n[38] \t\tJack wearing his Zeena suit, sitting behind his desk, \t\tdistracted, as he listens to HECTOR, 40s, the \n[39] \n[40] \t\tJack walks into the room...  \t\tThe lights are off, Kate already in bed sleeping.  \t\tHe undresses for bed, unable to take his eyes off Kate.  \t\tFinally, he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next \t\tto her, moving closer to her, putting an arm around \t\ther, drawing her in...  \t\tIn her sleep, Kate nestles in Jack\u0092s embrace.  He \t\tsavors the feeling, then closes his eyes as...  \t\tThey lay there...side by side...together...a single \t\tperson.  \n[41] \t\tThe morning light streams into the room.  Kate opens \t\ther eyes.  Jack\u0092s not in bed.  A look of curiosity.  \t\tThen, she hears LAUGHTER from outside.  \t\tShe goes over to the window...opens the blinds... \t\trevealing...  \t\tJack in the backyard, LAUGHING with joy, playing in the \t\tsnow with Annie and Josh.  \t\tKate watches...a satisfied smile sweeping across her \t\tface...  \n[42] \n[43] \t\tThe clock reads, \u009311:17.\u0094  Kate is already in bed as \t\tJack walks in.  \n[44] \t\tThe room is dark...  \t\tJack enters, sees Kate sleeping soundly in bed.  \t\tHe sits down in a chair and watches Kate asleep, a sad \t\tlook in his eyes...  \t\tAs he continues to watch her, to listen to her, his own \t\teyelids appear to grow heavy...  \t\tHe tries to fight the sleep...opening his eyes... \t\tfocusing on her...but it\u0092s no use...  \t\tFinally, he closes his eyes...falling into a deep \t\tsleep...  \n[45] \n[46] \t\tSnow is falling as Jack\u0092s car races up to the terminal \t\tthen stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD \t\tsees him...  \n[47] \t\tJack looking at the board. The nine o\u0092clock to Paris - \t\tGate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...  \n[48] \t\t...and gets there just as the flight is boarding. \t\tJack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the \t\tfront of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate \t\tattendant.  \t\tHe pushes through the throng of people, drawing some \t\tannoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.
