All it takes is a great idea. \n[2]That's why nobody can have a monopoly in a business built on ideas. \n[3]Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you. \n[4]  \n[5]Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV. \n[6]The house knows the paintings I like, it knows my favorite music. Same for anybody else who's in the system. \n[7]Would you like a Coke or something? \n[8]When we started, I just hired my smart friends. That was great. We got a little bigger, I had to hire smart strangers. Much harder. \n[9]Now I don't get to hire anybody. But I know you're the guy to write Skywire. \n[10]  \n[11]There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it. \n[12]There's more to life than computers? I'm looking into it. \n[13]'Once I start looking into something. \n[14]I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room. It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up. \n[15] \n[16]  \n[17]The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges. \n[18]You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me? \n[19]  \n[20]I know what people say, and not just the Justice Department. We clone ideas, inflict our second-rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1.0. \n[21]Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put some of our apps up against anybody's. But is there some truth to it? \n[22]When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 -- \n[23]  \n[24]Okay. I'm Gary. \n[25]'Think I should buy some originals? \n[26]Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions. \n[27]That's what I told her. My wife. \n[28]'Thinks I'll be less of a control freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives me something else to obsess about... \n[29]Anything we can salvage from the old code before you start fresh? \n[30]Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before? It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right? In a tree. \n[31]I don't remember. \n[32]I'm confused. Am I supposed to speculate under oath? \n[33] \n[34]This is good. Who did it? \n[35]Maybe we should all get on it. \n[36]How's it going? \n[37] \n[38]Even when I had a hand in every aspect of the company I knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process. \n[39](reaching into his pocket \n[40]You're making me young again. \n[41]  \n[42]  \n[43]I'm confused, Ted. \n[44]Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter 12 by the time they could hope to enjoin? I'm very confused, because you said they'd be ready to settle. \n[45]  \n[46]Milo. What's up? \n[47]Right... Right. \n[48] \n[49]Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead? \n[50]The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait. \n[51]It scales, don't you think? \n[52]What'd the girl say? \n[53]  \n[54]Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me. \n[55]I heard what happened. \n[56]Had you talked to him much lately? \n[57]Did you? \n[58]I meant did you find other stuff to -- \n[59]You've been coming in early. \n[60]Milo? \n[61]34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way. \n[62]Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place. \n[63]The answer's not in the box. It's in the band. \n[64]Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to think. \n[65]You look a little tired. \n[66]'Have a look? \n[67]Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid. \n[68]What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right? \n[69]...Worse? \n[70]Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet. \n[71]Milo? \n[72]I'm giving a benefit for the art museum Thursday night. Thought you'd like to bring Alice. \n[73] \n[74]   \n[75]  \n[76]Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife, Clarissa. Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's visiting from Hollywood. \n[77]Barry's studio's gonna help fill the Skywire pipeline, thought you guys should meet. \n[78]     \n[79]  \n[80]  \n[81]    \n[82]  \n[83]  \n[84]     \n[85]  \n[86]You could've handwritten it. \n[87]Oh, that's right. You're \"clueless.\" \n[88]No problem. Is there? \n[89]You see what's hanging on the wall? \n[90]I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are. \n[91]When will you have a Beta version? \n[92]I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control. \n[93]So you have to remind yourself: it's just the process. Something's always lost along the way to anything worthwhile. Some little bug, some glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in that, you're doing something other people could never do. They lack the imagination, the brain, the nerve. Let them fret about every unforeseen consequence. You have to solve the problem. That's who you are. \n[94]  \n[95]  \n[96]  \n[97]That's what he was doing in here. \n[98]Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate. \n[99]Just do what I'm asking! \n[100]  \n[101] \n[102]Okay, #2. \n[103]  \n[104] \n[105]Let's go. \n[106]Wait... He knows. \n[107]'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12. \n[108]Just do it. \n[109]  \n[110]Most of us who write software achieve our greatest work before age 30. As I grow older I know how important it is to access fertile young minds! \n[111]We work hard to stay ahead because we know any kid working in his garage can put us out of business. \n[112]The first rule of the software business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die. \n[113]That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices. Isn't that what the free market's about? Sure, we like being #1, but it's pressure, too. This business is binary: you're a zero or a one. \n[114]I've been called \"aggressive\" but to me, that's really a compliment. \n[115]Look at all the jobs and technologies my \"aggression\" has created. \n[116]We really are a family here at Outpost. \n[117]I think that's why outsiders sometimes sees us as \"cultish\" or \"secretive.\" \n[118]Is loyalty and group spirit somehow \"sinister\" nowadays? \n[119]  \n[120]Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You think I knew about this? \n[121]I'm running the company, fighting the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and Phil obviously overreacted. To this endless, antitrust witchhunt. \n[122]That won't be a problem. \n[123]As for PR, Skywire'll take care of all that. \n[124] \n[125]The world's seen it now. They know it's gonna dominate the convergence market even beyond how Outpost '98 dominates the desktop. \n[126]Go after us, you give foreign competitors a shot at the platform that'll hold sway for 30 years: you threaten not just our chip and PC partners like when you came after the browser. \n[127] \n[128]You threaten TV networks, phone companies, catalog outlets, publishing houses, movie studios, travel agents, airlines, stock brokerages -- you sabotage the whole economy. Talk about undermining innovation! \n[129]  \n[130]\"I had no knowledge of these activities, but I have to ask myself if the competitive environment I encouraged in some small way contributed --\" ", "Winston": "", "Bob": "", "Shrot": "\n[1]Unauthorized entries sound like this. \n[2]If you see a tailgater, report him. \n[3] (gives Milo a photo \n[4]Every geek has to try this once to show me how smart he is -- \n[5]Un-nh, can't wander around without ID now.

I been saying we need a camera in this hall. \n[7] \n[8]I could get it out of him. \n[9] \n[10]Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused? \n[11]Not yet.

'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later. \n[18]I'm calling Gary. \n[19]He's left his office, we think he's gone back to the Day Care for some reason. Can you tell me why, Gary? Whatever you say. Wants to consult with Phil. Was it Phil's idea to run the fingerprints? \n[20]Come with me. \n[21]What are you doing? \n[22]What're you doing?! \n[23]Who're these guys? \n[24]We're too late. Take a look. \n[25]What's in here worth taking, anyway? \n[26] \n[27]Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place. \n[28]Now what are we doing?

We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo. \n[17]He wasn't acting? \n[18]  \n[19]He's in the Day Care. \n[20]Yeah, alright.

They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they -- \n[9]If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway. \n[10]When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest. \n[11]He's pretty tight with his family. \n[12]He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything. \n[13]So -- how far are we from the campus? \n[14]Who's that? \n[15]...That's okay. \n[16]Cool! \n[17] \n[18]You know a lot about art, I guess. \n[19]Low enough to relay internet traffic. \n[20](turning the sleek object \n[21]It needs a more object-oriented language.

You're ahead of your time. \n[53]Uh, might be one or two things. \n[54]  \n[55] \n[56] \n[57]Could work with a new switch.

I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something. \n[71]Did I say something? \n[72]I used to wish that. All the time. \n[73] \n[74]Show me. \n[75]Cool! \n[76]...Sh-Show me the next one. \n[77]Well -- you sent for me. \n[78]You really wrote this just today? \n[79] \n[80] \n[81]Definitely. \n[82]To our new life. ...What's wrong? \n[83]He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, \"Did you really do this just today?\" Cause I was impressed. He said \"What're you implying?\" \n[84]It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly. \n[85]That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire. 'Not saying it makes sense. \n[86]I'm so stupid. \n[87] \n[88] \n[89]You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting. \n[90]No. Please. \n[91]\"There is no second place.\" Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration. Is it like that with your counselor? \n[92]Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code? \n[93] \n[94]Why's that? \n[95]So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now? \n[96]You're living here? \n[97]Sure, I'll see what I can do. \n[98]  \n[99]She saved my life. \n[100]How's it going down there? \n[101]What?! \n[102]Jesus, Teddy. \n[103]I met this girl. \n[104]I don't know. \n[105]No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful. \n[106]What d'you mean? \n[107]What does that mean? \n[108]I didn't plan this. \n[109]...What's wrong? \n[110]What! \n[111]What're you -- what? \n[112]They caught the guys? \n[113]He told me about the break-in. He didn't seem to take it that seriously. \n[114]I didn't know he was working with fiber optics. \n[115]I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and -- \n[116]Just thought his work should go on. \n[117]It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up. \n[118]Those really weird, short lines. \n[119]  \n[120]Were the flags for Teddy? \n[121]Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure. \n[122]Talk about work? Never! \n[123]Oh. Yeah. \n[124]It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something. 'Don't know what I'd do without her. \n[125]Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there... \n[126] \n[127]Gotta go home. 'Think I ate something. \n[128]     \n[129]Alice? Alice! \n[130]I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys. \n[131]I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says \"Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?\" It's like they know what every kid's doing. \n[132]Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically. Oh Jesus. \n[133] \n[134]It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top. \n[135]Go where? You can't get away from people like this. \n[136] \n[137]How should I know? \"Solving a problem,\" I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know. I've gotta get in there. \n[138]It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening. ...gotta get in there. \n[139]I can't just walk away! \n[140]They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five. \n[141]No! I can't just keep my head in the sand. That's how I got into this mess. \n[142]I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me. \n[143]So you believe me? \n[144]  \n[145]  \n[146]     \n[147]Come on. \n[148]Do you know who I am? \n[149] \n[150]Everything okay? \n[151]  \n[152] \n[153]Please don't be one of them. \n[154]   \n[155]He gave me this. 'Said I should come see him if -- \n[156]Can I wait in his office? \n[157]Please. \n[158]Mr. Barton, do you remember me? \n[159]Yes sir. I need to talk to you. \n[160]Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me. \n[161]I am. I am, sir. \n[162]My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley. \n[163]It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they? \n[164]I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis. \n[165] \n[166]Yes sir. \n[167]Nothing. \n[168]It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back. \n[169]Remember Lyle Barton? \n[170]The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when -- \n[171]After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary. \n[172] \n[173]I thought, instead of indulging all these paranoid delusions, risking my job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I should do something useful with my grief. Help them find Teddy's killers. \n[174] \n[175]...Different? \n[176]I snuck into #21. \n[177]You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care. \n[178]Can we go someplace else? \n[179]It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there. \n[180]You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make \"sense.\" I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much. \n[181]I'm not one of them. Not trying to \"suss you out.\" \n[182]They killed my best friend! I'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. Can't you trust somebody just once? I don't wanna be alone here. \n[183]  \n[184]They'd frame him. \n[185] \n[186]Nobody's gonna hurt you. \n[187]Hmm? \n[188]No, no. Never. \n[189]They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over. \n[190]There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question. \n[191]We don't tell anybody. We tell everybody. At once. So there's no secret left to protect. When everybody knows, they don't dare touch us. \n[192]Do we post it on the Net? \n[193]Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick. \n[194]Certainly not at my happy home. \n[195]   \n[196]Gary, hi. \n[197]I'm okay. It's going well! \n[198]Sure. \n[199]...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a \"system.\" \"Losers,\" who played games of chance. He could \"read\" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious. His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again. \n[200]No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse. \n[201]Cause he was a liar. And I hated him. \"Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world.\" The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him -- Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side.

Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into -- \n[221]Larry used to say how the guys who wrote the first cool operating systems, like the UNIX guys at Berkeley?

Air the Skywire code. Then nobody can have a monopoly. \n[222]Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.

But it's meant a lot more. \n[245]I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software. \n[246]  \n[247]I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again. \n[248]No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now.
