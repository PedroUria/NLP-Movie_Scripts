The grass is rich. The game is plenty and not running away. \n[3]I was thinking of a dance. \n[4]Yes. \n[5]I have seen such a sign. \n[6]I saw a man, a white man. \n[7]Just one. He was naked. \n[8]I saw his sex. \n[9]No. \n[10]He might be a god or he might be a special chief -- that's why we are thinking of having a talk with him. \n[11]You are right, we need meat today and tomorrow. But we must also have meat in ten years. \n[12]But the whites are coming. Our friends the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our enemies, agree on this -- the whites are coming. More than can be counted. \n[13]Wind In His Hair has spoken straight, his words are strong and I have heard them. It's true the whites are a poor race and it's hard to understand them. But when I see one white man alone, without fear in our country, I do not think he is lost. I think he may have medicine. I see someone who might speak for all the white people who are coming. I think this is a person with which treaties might be struck. \n[14]The soldier did not come to fight -- he is going away and we will let him. \n[15]Buffalo. \n[16] \n[17]Have you seen any buffalo? \n[18]  \n[19]Stands With A Fist. \n[20]We will talk awhile. \n[21]  \n[22]Your wounds are healing well? \n[23]You are happy here, with my family? \n[24]Perhaps you will marry again when the time is right. \n[25]We have word from many places that the whites are... \n[26]They are coming into everyone's country. They will soon be in ours I think. This white man who lives at the old soldier fort, the one who calls himself loo ten tant... I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one. He knows things about the whites which we do not. \n[27]He is only one man. \n[28]Every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried. \n[29]I cannot make the white man talk. Loo ten tant does not know Sioux. \n[30]You have a certain medicine which no other Sioux -- man or woman -- has. \n[31]I do not ask this for myself... I ask this for all our people. \n[32]I want you to try and remember the the word. \n[33]You don't want to know. \n[34]  \n[35]Perhaps I am asking too much. \n[36]Buffalo? \n[37]The buffalo have come. \n[38]Loo ten tant... \n[39]Where is loo ten tant? \n[40]Does it scratch the skin? \n[41]  \n[42]        \n[43]        \n[44]Yes, he is special... he should have a real name. \n[45]    \n[46]I know. \n[47]        \n[48]We were waiting for you. \n[49] \n[50]Ask him why he is at the soldier fort. \n[51]What does he say? \n[52]Ahhh...

It is a place I haven't seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would like you to come with me. \n[79]Yes it must be. \n[80]No waiting? \n[81]I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others. It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see. \n[82]It is said that all the animals were born here... that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people.

And these are the post's provisions. Now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload. \n[33]Good. \n[34]Thank you. \n[35]Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted. Am now waiting for the garrison's return or word from headquarters. Post is in exceedingly poor condition. Have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The country is everything I dreamed it would be. There can be no place like this on earth. \n[36]Damn... damn. \n[37]No sign of Captain Cargill's command. I don't know what to do. Communication can only take place if I leave and I don't want to abandon my post. \n[38]Made a short patrol yesterday p.m... discovered nothing. Will go further tomorrow. \n[39]There is a wolf who seems intent on the goings on here. He does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and aside from Cisco has been my only company. He has appeared each afternoon for the past two days. He has milky white socks on both feet. If he comes calling tomorrow I will name him Two Socks. \n[40]Almost a month and no one has come. The longer this condition persists, the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will. Rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. I have begun an awning. The work has ruined my hands, but I am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place. \n[41]It is the loneliest of times... but I cannot say that I am unhappy. \n[42]You there! \n[43]Have made first contact with a wild Indian. One came to the fort and tried to steal my horse. Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation. Am burying excess ordnance, lest it fall into enemy hands. \n[44]Have made all the preparations I can think of. I cannot mount an adequate defense but will try to make a big impression when they come. Waiting. \n[45]The man I encountered was a magnificent looking fellow. \n[46]I realize now that I have been wrong. All this time I have been waiting. Waiting for what? For someone to find me? For Indians to take my horse? To see a buffalo? \n[47]Since I arrived at this post I have been walking on eggs. It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it. Tomorrow morning I will ride out to the Indians. I do not know the outcome or the wisdom of this thinking. But I have become a target and a target makes a poor impression. I am through waiting. \n[48]Wait... \n[49]Wait... you're hurt. \n[50]Let me help you. \n[51]You're hurt... you need help. \n[52]She's hurt. \n[53]Welcome... Come... please... sit down. \n[54]Would you like some coffee? Coffee? \n[55]I'll get some cups. \n[56]Is the coffee not good? Too strong maybe? Here... \n[57] \n[58]So what are you guys doing? Looking for buffalo? \n[59]He's a good one... good horse. My horse. \n[60]Good horse. \n[61]My horse. You see any buffalo? \n[62]Wait just a bit. \n[63] \n[64] \n[65]Buffalo. \n[66]The sugar didn't figure to last at that rate any way. I don't believe I'd go too far in saying that a foundation for good relations is being laid. \n[67]They have come again, as always the same two with an escort of six. \n[68]I believe I am dealing with Kiowa Indians as I have heard that word on several occasions. \n[69]I am learning the Kiowa words for head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, buffalo, hello and goodbye. \n[70]No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are you hungry? I have food... are you hungry? \n[71]Nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not beggars and thieves. They are not the bogeymen they have been made out to be. \n[72]Buffalo... \n[73]Buffalo... Buffalo. \n[74]Yes. Buffalo. \n[75]I wish I knew what to say. \n[76]Thank you. \n[77]Look I'm full... I can't tell the story again. \n[78]Go ahead. \n[79] \n[80]Here. \n[81]This is too much... I can't take this... \n[82]I can't... No more... \n[83]I can't, I'm full... very full... \n[84]That's my hat. \n[85]My hat. \n[86]Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep. \n[87]They asked me to dance... \n[88]I was just dancing... \n[89]To stay any longer would've been useless. We had all the meat we could possibly carry. We had hunted for three days, losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured. Many times I have felt alone but until this afternoon, I have never felt completely lonely. \n[90]Made a long patrol today. There is nothing to report. The truth is I am bored. \n[91]Though only two days it seems like a week. I am missing the company of my new friends. I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough. Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced visit. After all, they are my neighbors, what can it hurt? \n[92]Go home. \n[93]Damn him. \n[94]C'mon Two Socks... you can't go... so go home. \n[95]Alright then, don't go home. But stay... stay right here. \n[96]You go home. \n[97]Thank you...

John Dunbar. \n[109]Yes. \n[110]I try to answer all of Kicking Bird's questions but I know he is frustrated with me. He always wants to know how many more white people are coming. I tell him that it is impossible for me to say. When he persists I tell him that the white people will most likely pass through this country and nothing more. \n[111]But I am speaking to him in half- truths. One day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him that. I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows. \n[112]  \n[113]A war party is going against the Pawnee soon and I have asked to go. I sensed that I have made a mistake in doing so but I could not bring myself to take it back. They are my friends and from what little I gather the Pawnee have been very hard on these people. I hope I have not overstepped my bounds. \n[114]I'm glad to see you... please sit. \n[115]They are Sioux enemies. \n[116]I asked that he would think about my going. \n[117]Then tell him this. I have been a warrior for longer than many of the young men that will go on this war party. Tell him. \n[118]I know, I understand.
