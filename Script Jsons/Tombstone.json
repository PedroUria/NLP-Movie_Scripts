Thank you, God. \n[5] ", "Henry": "", "Hooker": "\n[1] Armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes scanning the tracks beneath him.  He rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house.  He dismounts, studying tracks as rancher HENRY HOOKER rides up, strong, noble-looking, like something from a Frederic Remington canvas.  Wyatt nods. Hooker nods back.  \n[2]That's right.  And I'm Hooker. \n[3]Look, Mister, it's fine for you Boomers to court trouble, you're Just passin' through.  Us Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I Can do's point you up to the cut. That's their roost. \n[4] Wyatt's group rides over the hill overlooking the ranch house Vermillion keeping Doc in the saddle.  Hooker and 3 of his hands rides out to them:  \n[5]You can put up at my ranch if you want. \n[6] Doc lies in bed, semi-conscious, white as a sheet, drenched in sweat.  The others look on, worried.  Hooker shakes his head:  \n[7]I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad. \n[8] The stage is stopped out front.  The driver waters the horses and the actors mill around silently.  Wyatt and Hooker walk out:  \n[9]Had a holdup.  Came her to water Their horses before pushin' on. \n[10] Wyatt and his men are on the porch, listening to Hooker:  \n[11]...brought 'em in draped over their saddles.  Little Billy Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done It.  So I guess the law's finally Arrived in southeast Arizona. \n[12] Wyatt stands on the front porch, looking through the front door to the back bedroom where Doc lies unconscious while Hooker and the others look on:  \n[13]Don't have to bother about that. Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you Can stay here as long as you want. Anyway maybe you done enough.  I Mean you whittled 'em down Considerable, now there's talk of Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me, You done enough. \n[14] McMasters rides up with the 3rd Cowboy.  Riding through camp, all his former comrades flares at him with pure hate.  Only Ringo smiles, stepping up as McMasters dismounts.  \n[15] The 3rd Cowboy rides up to the ranch house, dumps a large SOMETHING in front, and gallops back to just within earshot as Wyatt and his men run up.  The object is a human corpse and though we can't see what was done to it, the expressions on their faces are plain enough.  \n[16] It's late and the last rays of the sun come through the window, falling on the bed where Doc lies, awake but looking like hell.  Wyatt sits next to him, staring at the floor. After a moment:  \n[17] It's late, almost sunset.  Wyatt steps onto the porch where Hooker and the others wait.  He glances back into the house, looking at the unconscious Doc through the open bedroom door.  \n[18]Don't worry.  They want him They'll have to go over us first. \n[19] Ringo waits atop the hill with Ike and the 3rd Cowboy watching as Wyatt's group rides out:  \n[20] Ringo and the others ride up.  Hooker steps up with several hands.  \n[21]What're you doin' here? \n[22]It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine He's dyin'. \n[23]I looked the other way when you Did a lot of foul things but I Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin' Man.  Not as long as he's under my Roof.

She snaps out of it and sits up as Wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing at the half-empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand.  \n[155]That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff. \n[156]Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'? \n[157]Really?  You sure? \n[158]Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be? \n[159]Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it. \n[160]I know.

Just the Same, though... Guess you better swear me in. \n[169] In tight on a brass-mounted wooden case.  It opens to reveal a gleaming Colt .45 with an extra long barrel, the gold shield inlaid on the burr walnut grips engraved with, \"To Wyatt Earp, Peacemaker...\"  This is the Buntline Special, Wyatt Earp's legendary sidearm.  Wyatt takes it from the case and puts it in his coat pocket as Mattie looks on.  \n[170]Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things. \n[171]Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on. \n[172]Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this. \n[173]Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest. \n[174]You'll never make that stick. \n[175]Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas.

If there was any other- \n[187]How you doin', boy? \n[188]I know, kid.  I know.  Me too. \n[189] Mattie irons shirts in the adjoining bedroom while Wyatt finishes shaving in the dressing room, wiping foam from his face, looking in the cabinet for a towel.  Opening the bottom drawer, a nest of small brown bottles clatters onto the floor. Laudanum bottles, all empty.  Mattie looks up as Wyatt comes out, bottle in hand:  \n[190]Mattie.  What about this? \n[191]'Least you admit it. \n[192]Look, Mattie, I know you're- \n[193]All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.

Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen. \n[223]The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law.  If we fail the U.S. Government won't be able to lift A finger to help us.  Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land. \n[224]Raise your right hands.

Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs. \n[245]We'll go around that way, come up on foot. \n[246]No. \n[247]No. \n[248]No... \n[249]No... \n[250]No... \n[251]No! \n[252]No! \n[253]No... \n[254]No... \n[255]I don't know.

Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason. \n[267]Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust. \n[268]We should get moving. \n[269]I don't like it. \n[270]You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there. \n[271]I made a promise. \n[272]But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would. \n[273]What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does? \n[274]So what does he want? \n[275]Revenge?  For what? \n[276]Remember how I said it all Happened so fast with Curly Bill I didn't have time to think about it? Well I've had plenty of time To think about this.  I spent most Of my life since I was born not Knowing what I want out of life, Just chasin' my tail.  But now, For the first time I know exactly What I want.  And who.  And that's The damnable misery of it. I can't beat him, can I? \n[277]That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry. \n[278]They're not givin' you any safe Conduct.  Soon as the shooting Starts kick east for the New Mexico line.  Well... \n[279]I know.  Me neither. \n[280]Dear God, this is the last Battle.

You've preserved me This far so I only ask one more Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man.  Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it. \n[281]What happened? \n[282]All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way. \n[283]So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us. \n[284]How you feelin', Doc? \n[285] \n[286]All right, Doc... \n[287]All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life. \n[288]That's great coming from you. \n[289]Then what do I do? \n[290]All right.  Then what? \n[291]Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven. \n[292]I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life. \n[293]There.

Awfully Toney for a mining camp.  No, the Die's cast, we're growing, be as Big as San Francisco in a few Years.  And just as sophisticated. \n[8]That must be the theatrical Troupe.

And very married. \n[11]Have you been out in the street? Somebody's got to do something. \n[12]It's not County business, it's a Town matter. \n[13]Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.

And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling. \n[11]My sweet clever Magyar, so that's Why you're not wearing a bustle. \n[12]Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect. \n[13]Since when is faro a business? \n[14]I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house. \n[15]That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything. \n[16]Oh sorry, Johnny, I forgot all About you.  You can go now.  Just Leave the shotgun. \n[17]Forgive me if I don't shake hands. \n[18]Little ahead of yourselves, Aren't you?

If you get lucky. \n[26]And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure. \n[27]So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others? \n[28]I see.  And what would you do if \"she\" walked in her right now? \n[29]You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan. \n[30]Ignore her? \n[31]I'll remember you said that. \n[32]I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak. \n[33] \n[34]Well he hems, he haws, he talks Out of both sides of his Mouth-but all on a very high Plane, just like Hamlet. \n[35]That's the rumor. \n[36]Not me.  I'm in my prime. \n[37]And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him? \n[38]Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him. \n[39]In vino veritas. \n[40]Credat Judaeus Apella. \n[41] \n[42]Evidently Mr. Ringo's an educated Man.  Now I really hate him. \n[43]Enough?  Never. \n[44]What? \n[45]I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne. \n[46]You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin. \n[47]You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.

I know, let's have a spelling Contest! \n[54]Well that certainly was a bust.  I Want my money back.  Come, Darling, let's seek our Entertainment elsewhere. \n[55]Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail. \n[56] Later.  Doc sits up in bed, revived but looking like death warmed over, mouth gaping open, eyes swimming with every breath.  DR. GOODFELLOW stands by the bed, putting on his jacket.  \n[57]So what does that mean? \n[58]Well, that sounds inviting. \n[59]Better. \n[60]We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association. \n[61]Not exactly... \n[62]Yes, I know.  You are a good woman. \n[63]Then again, you may be the Antichrist. \n[64]What the hell's going on?

You call it. \n[70]Can't you see why he did it? \n[71]And so she walked out of our Lives forever. \n[72]Oh... All right. \n[73]You know why I'm here.  My Hypocrisy only goes so far. \n[74]Say something witty. \n[75]It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut. \n[76]They saw us.

Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about? \n[88]Down at the creek.  Walking on water. \n[89]Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on... \n[90]A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty. \n[91]What does he want?  He wants revenge. \n[92]Being born. \n[93]No, wait, I'll go with you... \n[94]I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry. \n[95]Never got to wear one of those. \n[96]Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave. Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out. \n[97]I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember? \n[98]I wasn't. And this time it's legal. \n[99]Say when. \n[100]Come on!  Come on! \n[101]Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no Daisy at all. \n[102]Poor soul, he was so high-strung. Afraid the strain was more than He could bear. \n[103]Let's go!  My horse is over here. \n[104]I just wanted to see what it felt Like.  Here... \n[105]Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.
