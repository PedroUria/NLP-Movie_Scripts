Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you? \n[2]That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt. \n[3]Well... wait for it... First there's this one... \n[4]Point taken. \n[5]I suspect you'll prefer the next one. \n[6]Cool, huh? \n[7]Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more. \n[8]Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck. \n[9]Hi. \n[10]I'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food -- and then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins. \n[11]There's something wrong with this yogurt. \n[12]Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic. \n[13]Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her. \n[14]Hey. \n[15]Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes... \n[16]Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey. \n[17]There's something wrong with the goggles though... \n[18]Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff. \n[19]Yeh, I wrote a couple down. \n[20]You want me to write down all your messages? \n[21]Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again. \n[22]Absolutely not. \n[23]Though if we're going for this obsessive writing-down-all-messages thing -- some American girl called Anna called a few days ago. \n[24]Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name. \n[25]Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough... \n[26]Try 'Flintstone.' \n[27]I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.' \n[28]No, 'fraid not. \n[29]That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer? \n[30] \n[31]Come on -- open up -- this is me -- Spikey -- I'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations. What's wrong? \n[32]Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend. \n[33]Yeh.  Yeh... tricky... tricky... I knew a girl at school called Pandora ... never got to see her box though. \n[34]Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic .... magnificent... \n[35]Just checking. \n[36]Thank you, God. \n[37]Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni. \n[38] \n[39]Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word. \n[40]I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it? \n[41]And she's in your house. \n[42]And you get on very well. \n[43]Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? \n[44]Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go? \n[45]No -- you're right. \n[46]Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay. \n[47]Morning, daring ones. \n[48]Why not? \n[49]How did I look? \n[50]Not bad.  No bad at all.  Well-chosen briefs, I'd say.  Chicks love grey. Mmmmm.  Nice firm buttocks. \n[51] \n[52]Looks like a chauffeur to me. \n[53]What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan. \n[54]I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub. \n[55]Me? \n[56]Well, yes.  Groovy. \n[57]What's going on? \n[58]No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this. \n[59]Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives. \n[60]I was called and I came.  What's up? \n[61]You daft prick! \n[62]Bugger this for a bunch of bananas. \n[63]Go! \n[64]What happened? ", "Martin": "\n[1]Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain. \n[2]Cappuccino as ordered. \n[3]Who?  Someone famous? \n[4]Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy. \n[5]That's right -- Topol. \n[6]No, well... he was quite a long way away. \n[7]I suppose so. \n[8]Not classic, no. \n[9]Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice. \n[10]Can I help you? \n[11]I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery. \n[12]But it's not for the shop.  It's for you. \n[13]Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone. \n[14]I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color... \n[15]Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film. \n[16]Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life. \n[17]Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming? \n[18]Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been a bit of an ass. \n[19]Anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of course.

I'll think about it. \n[4]No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see. \n[5]Yes. \n[6]What's your name? \n[7]Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.' \n[8]Tempting but... no, thank you. \n[9]I think I will try this one. \n[10]Thanks. \n[11]Oh Jesus. \n[12]What are you doing?! \n[13]No thank you.

I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint. \n[24]Hi. \n[25]Probably best not tell anyone about this. \n[26]Bye. \n[27]No. \n[28]I've got nothing to smile about. \n[29]Hi. \n[30]You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call. \n[31]Oh -- Okay. \n[32]Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good. \n[33]Hello. \n[34]Oh no, ho -- these are great. \n[35]No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi. \n[36]Yes, thanks. \n[37]Is that so? \n[38]Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space. \n[39]No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. \n[40]It takes place on a submarine. \n[41]And what happens next in the dream? \n[42]Yes. \n[43]Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice. \n[44]  \n[45]Come in. \n[46]Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. \n[47]Okay -- fine. \n[48]No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date. \n[49]If that's all right. \n[50]Okay. \n[51]Hi. \n[52]Thank you. \n[53]Hiya. \n[54]Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday. \n[55]I'll think about it. \n[56]I'm an actress. \n[57]Well, they can be. \n[58]Films mainly. \n[59]Fifteen million dollars. \n[60] \n[61] \n[62]Wait a minute.  What about me? \n[63]Well... a shot at it. \n[64]Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this... \n[65]Really -- and one day, not long from now... \n[66]... my looks will go, they'll find out I can't act and I'll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while. \n[67]That was such a great evening. \n[68]And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. \n[69]You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. \n[70] \n[71]Night, night, Honey. \n[72]You too -- from now on you are my style guru. \n[73]Floppy, huh? \n[74]Why is she in a wheelchair? \n[75]And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? \n[76]Too complicated. \n[77]Busy tomorrow? \n[78]I was. \n[79]What's in there? \n[80]Let's go in. \n[81]You abide by rules like that? \n[82]What did you say? \n[83]Yes, you did. \n[84]You said 'whoopsidaisies.' \n[85]There's no 'unless.'  No one has said \"whoopsidaisies\" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets. \n[86]Step aside. \n[87]Come on, Flops. \n[88]'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.' \n[89]Some people do spend their whole lives together. \n[90]So who left who? \n[91]Why? \n[92]Uh-oh.  That's not good. \n[93]No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same. \n[94]In fact -- give me a second. \n[95]Hi. \n[96]I'm sorry about my friend -- he's very sensitive. \n[97]Please, please -- let's just leave it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm, and I'm sure it was just friendly banter and I'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts.  A perfect match for the size of your brains.  Enjoy your meal.  The tuna's really good. \n[98]I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that. \n[99]I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you? \n[100]I don't know either. \n[101]Here we are. Do you want to come up? \n[102]There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up? \n[103]Give me five minutes. \n[104]  \n[105]Hiya. \n[106] \n[107]Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. \n[108]Yes... \n[109]Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job. \n[110]Nice surprise. \n[111]I haven't decided. \n[112]I'm sorry... I don't know what to say. \n[113]Hi.  Can I come in? \n[114]They were taken years ago -- I know it was... well, I was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well.  So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere. \n[115]I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded. \n[116]Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. \n[117]These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like... \n[118]A bath would be great. \n[119]You must be Spike. \n[120]Hi. \n[121]I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again. \n[122]I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love? \n[123]I have thought about you. \n[124]Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster. \n[125]Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday. \n[126]Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk. \n[127]I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster. \n[128]'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives. \n[129]'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make? \n[130]Damn.  'And Wainwright...' \n[131]'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.' \n[132]My son's name is Johnny? \n[133]Well, get a message through to him too. \n[134]What do you think? \n[135]You think I should do Henry James instead? \n[136]Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.' \n[137]I can't believe you have that picture on your wall. \n[138]I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky. \n[139]Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat. \n[140]Fantastic. \n[141]You've got big feet. \n[142]You know what they say about men with big feet? \n[143]Big feet -- large shoes. \n[144]The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses. \n[145]Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.' \n[146]I could have a stunt bottom, yes. \n[147]Definitely.  Ths is important stuff. \n[148]Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious. \n[149]Both. \n[150]Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected. \n[151]Right. \n[152]Okay. \n[153]What? \n[154]You and every person in this country. \n[155]What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them? \n[156]No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them... \n[157]But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about? \n[158]Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that? \n[159]Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me? \n[160] \n[161]I'll be back. \n[162]Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch. \n[163]Can I stay a bit longer? \n[164]Damn, I forgot the jam. \n[165]You get the door, I'll get the jam. \n[166]What? \n[167]You're up to something... \n[168]Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that? \n[169]Jesus. \n[170]  \n[171]How do you think I'm doing? \n[172]I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was. \n[173]Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear. \n[174]This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. \n[175]As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu. \n[176]You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.' \n[177]Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott. \n[178]I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home. \n[179]And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal. \n[180]You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different. \n[181]Excuse me? \n[182]You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. \n[183]This is certainly... ah... \n[184]I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to... \n[185] \n[186]But... wait... there are things to say. \n[187]Drink tea -- there's lots of tea. \n[188]We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday. \n[189]I'm not listening. \n[190]I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet. \n[191]So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...? \n[192]And then I... right. \n[193]Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation. \n[194]Hi. \n[195]You disappeared. \n[196]Well... how have you been? \n[197]Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and... \n[198]I thought I'd give it to you. \n[199]No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed. \n[200]I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ... \n[201]Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again. \n[202]You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England? \n[203]Is that right? \n[204]I can't say I know Patrick all that well. \n[205]Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.' \n[206]That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. \n[207]... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you. \n[208]I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it? \n[209]Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision. \n[210]The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. \n[211]Bye. \n[212]No time at all.  I fly out tonight. \n[213]Absolutely not. \n[214]It's really not my business any more. Though I will say, from my experience, that rumours about Jeff... do tend to be true. \n[215]He was just a friend -- I think we're still friends. \n[216]I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't. \n[217]No, let him... ask away.  You were saying? \n[218]Yes, I'm pretty sure I would. \n[219]Indefinitely. ", "Scott": "", "William": "\n[1]Of course, I've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world I live in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be... \n[2]There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man... \n[3]The tattoo parlour -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'... \n[4]The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not... \n[5]Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate... \n[6]... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine... \n[7]... and some not so genuine. \n[8]And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant... \n[9]So this is where I spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and I bought together... before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer... \n[10]... and where I now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called... \n[11] \n[12]Spike! \n[13]This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt? \n[14]What are the choices? \n[15]Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note. \n[16]Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind. \n[17]Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done. \n[18]Good luck. \n[19]And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever.  This is work, by the way, my little travel book shop... \n[20]... which, well, sells travel books -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those. \n[21]Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus \u001b$B!r\u001b(J347. \n[22]Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford. \n[23]Can I help you? \n[24]Fine. \n[25]That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money. \n[26]Yes.  This one though is... very good. \n[27]I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab. \n[28]If you could just give me a second. \n[29]Excuse me. \n[30]Bad news. \n[31]We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop. \n[32]So, I saw you put that book down your trousers. \n[33]The one down your trousers. \n[34]Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,  what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize. \n[35]Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec. \n[36]Sorry about that... \n[37]Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune. \n[38]Oh -- right -- on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually -- it's a sort of masterpiece really. None of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days.  And I'll throw in one of these for free. \n[39]Very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things. \n[40]Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here. \n[41]No. No-one -- no-one. \n[42]Topol. \n[43]But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol. \n[44]So it could have been neither of them? \n[45]Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it? \n[46]Right -- want another one? \n[47]Here, let me help. \n[48]Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up. \n[49]I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously. \n[50]Eighteen yards.  That's my house there. \n[51]  \n[52]Come on in.  I'll just... \n[53]It's not that tidy, I fear. \n[54]The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there. \n[55]Would you like a cup of tea before you go? \n[56]Coffee? \n[57]Orange juice -- probably not. \n[58]Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest? \n[59]Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them. \n[60]Do you always say 'no' to everything? \n[61]You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. \n[62]Take my one chance to say it.  After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop. \n[63]Yes.  Well.  My pleasure. \n[64]Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice. \n[65]'Surreal but nice.'  What was I thinking? \n[66]Coming. \n[67]Oh hi.  Forget something? \n[68]Oh right. \n[69]Here we go. \n[70]I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster... \n[71]Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry -- there's no excuse for him. \n[72]Hi. \n[73]Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it. \n[74]It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise. \n[75]  \n[76] \n[77]Yes, she is fairly fabulous. \n[78]No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only sell travel books. \n[79]No, that's a novel too. \n[80]Martin -- your customer. \n[81]  \n[82]Hi... \n[83]  \n[84]Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that? \n[85]There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes. \n[86]  \n[87]No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly. \n[88]So -- any messages? \n[89]Two?  That's it? \n[90]Who were the ones you didn't write down from? \n[91]Right.  No one else? \n[92]What did she say? \n[93]Which was? \n[94]  \n[95]Hello. \n[96]Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you... \n[97]No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake. \n[98] \n[99]Imagine if you will the stupidest person you've ever met -- are you doing that...? \n[100]And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember... \n[101] \n[102]Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you? \n[103]Oh my God. \n[104]Hello.  Hi.  Hi. \n[105] \n[106]No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message. \n[107]Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something? \n[108]Right.  Great. Classic.  Classic. \n[109]Which floor? \n[110]Are you sure you...? \n[111]Oh.  Right. \n[112]I agree. \n[113](seeing it on a coffee \n[114]No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. \n[115]Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away. \n[116]Hi. \n[117]I brought these, but clearly... \n[118]Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect. \n[119]So I'll just fire away, shall I? \n[120]Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it? \n[121]Obviously.  Very difficult. \n[122]I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. \n[123]Absolutely fine about it. \n[124]Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our readers are equally intrigued by both species. \n[125]Yes.  Right... But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing? \n[126]I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you. \n[127]Well, I suppose in the dream dream scenario.  I just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen. \n[128]Very nearly. \n[129]Right. \n[130]Are you busy tonight? \n[131]Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied. \n[132]Fabulous. \n[133]Yes.  That's right.  Bitch. \n[134]The others? \n[135]Ah... yes, enormously. \n[136]Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film? \n[137]Any bit in particular? \n[138]Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making  that bit? \n[139]Did you identify with the character you were playing? \n[140]Ah.  Why not? \n[141]Classic. \n[142]Is this your first film? \n[143]Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22? \n[144]Da Vinci? \n[145]Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director? \n[146] \n[147]Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner. \n[148]But no, I'm sure I can get out of it. \n[149]You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party? \n[150]I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something. \n[151]Okay. \n[152]He's cooking guinea fowl? \n[153]Bella -- this is Anna. \n[154]Max.  This is Anna. \n[155]Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter. \n[156]That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment. \n[157]No, it doesn't. \n[158]Definitely no comment. \n[159]Bernie. \n[160]Bella. \n[161]So I get the brownie? \n[162]You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim. \n[163]Pathetic effort to hog the brownie. \n[164]Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house. \n[165]It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair. \n[166]It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago. \n[167]You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it. \n[168]Would you like to come... my house is just...? \n[169]That's fine. \n[170]I thought you were leaving. \n[171]Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages. \n[172]Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in. \n[173]Ahm... \n[174]Heck no -- other people do -- but not me -- I just do what I want. \n[175] \n[176]Nothing. \n[177]No, I didn't. \n[178]I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're... \n[179]Exactly.  Here we go again. \n[180]Whoopsidaisies. \n[181]It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long. \n[182]Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks... \n[183]Oh no it's not -- it's easy. \n[184]Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile? \n[185]Nice garden. \n[186]  \n[187]Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses? \n[188]Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties. \n[189]Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go. \n[190]  \n[191] \n[192]Sort of. \n[193]She left me. \n[194]She saw through me. \n[195]Right, that's it. \n[196]I'm sorry to disturb you guys but -- \n[197]Well, yes, I wish I hadn't overheard your conversation -- but I did and I just think, you know... \n[198]...the person you're talking about is a real person and I think she probably deserves a little bit more consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her... \n[199]I'm sorry. \n[200]No, you were brilliant \n[201]I don't know, I'm afraid. \n[202] \n[203]Hi. \n[204]To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing. \n[205]Why? \n[206]Your boyfriend? \n[207]Ahm... room service. \n[208]Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call. \n[209]I'll see what I can do. \n[210]Absolutely.  Ice cold still water. \n[211]No, I'm sure it'll be fine. \n[212]Right. \n[213]Ah -- no.  It's fine. \n[214]Ahm... Bernie. \n[215]I better leave. \n[216]-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize... \n[217]I think goodbye is traditional. \n[218]  \n[219]  \n[220]Well, okay.  There's this girl... \n[221]She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside. \n[222]Thanks.  Yes -- very helpful. \n[223]No -- did you? \n[224]Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine. \n[225]Buggered? \n[226]Really? \n[227] \n[228]And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly? \n[229]Right.  Right.  Interesting stuff. So these carrots... \n[230]Murdered?  Poor carrots.  How beastly. \n[231]Interesting means inedible. \n[232]Yes.  That would be... great. \n[233]She's perfect, perfect. \n[234]I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters. \n[235]No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend. \n[236]In a depressingly asexual way. \n[237]Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch. \n[238]Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman. \n[239]  \n[240]  \n[241]Come in. \n[242]This is the place. \n[243]Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...? \n[244]  \n[245]  \n[246]  \n[247]  \n[248]  \n[249]No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me. How is he? \n[250]Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer. \n[251]Oh no no -- no. \n[252]I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing? \n[253]Would you like me to take you through your lines? \n[254]Hand it over.  Basic plot? \n[255]Well done you. \n[256]'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?' \n[257]'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.' \n[258]Eleven. \n[259]Cartwright. \n[260]'Certainly.  And little Johnny?' \n[261]Yup. \n[262]Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say. \n[263]Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping. \n[264]I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too. \n[265]And I think the book is the poorer for it. \n[266]  \n[267]You like Chagall? \n[268]With a goat playing a violin. \n[269]I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I? \n[270]  \n[271]Yes.  Always have had. \n[272]No.  What's that? \n[273]  \n[274]You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity? \n[275]You have a stunt bottom? \n[276]Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own? \n[277]It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom. \n[278]The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom? \n[279]  \n[280]Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed. \n[281]    \n[282]  \n[283]Spike. \n[284]Maybe. \n[285]Yes. \n[286]Yes. \n[287]Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip. \n[288]Spike! \n[289]I'll talk to you in the morning. \n[290]Oh please sod off. \n[291]No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not. \n[292]  \n[293]Wow. \n[294]Nothing. \n[295]  \n[296]  \n[297]It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked. \n[298]Oh God yes -- I'm sorry. \n[299]Well... \n[300]More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair... \n[301] \n[302]No, beats me. \n[303]Who was Gilda? \n[304] \n[305]  \n[306]Stay forever. \n[307]  \n[308]Jesus Christ. \n[309]Don't ask. \n[310]Undressed like this, yes. \n[311]  \n[312]I wouldn't go outside. \n[313]Just take my work for it. \n[314]  \n[315]  \n[316]  \n[317]How are you doing? \n[318]I don't know what happened. \n[319]That's not true. \n[320]Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry. \n[321]You do? \n[322]I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm... \n[323]That's spectacularly unfair. \n[324]Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea. \n[325]Spike, check who that is... and for God's sake put some clothes on. \n[326]  \n[327]That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter. \n[328]Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective. \n[329]I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins. \n[330]Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow. \n[331]Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came.  But you're right -- you probably better go. \n[332]  \n[333]Was it you? \n[334]Right. \n[335]Blimey.  What's that? \n[336]Well, thanks, that's great. \n[337]Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. \n[338]Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth. \n[339]But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy. \n[340]I believe I have. \n[341]No, don't think I do. \n[342] \n[343]Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott... \n[344]No, no.  She doesn't. \n[345]Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically... \n[346]I only found out you were here yesterday. \n[347]Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy. \n[348]Okay. \n[349]This is Henry James film? \n[350]That's great. \n[351]Of course. \n[352]Thank you. \n[353]  \n[354]I'm going to throw out these old videos. \n[355]Right -- let's talk about rent... \n[356]Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself? \n[357]Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you? \n[358]Hello. \n[359]Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you. \n[360]Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ... \n[361]Thank you.  Shall I... \n[362]Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway. \n[363]What's the thing? \n[364]Don't even think about it.  Go away immediately. \n[365]You were saying... \n[366]But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones. \n[367]Can you tell her I'll ring her back. \n[368]Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin? \n[369]Sorry about that. \n[370]Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level- headed bloke.  Not often in and out of love.  But... \n[371]... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that? \n[372]The truth is... \n[373]... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically. \n[374]I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name. \n[375]What do you think?  Good move? \n[376]Tony -- what do you think? \n[377]Brilliant.  Max? \n[378]Great.  Excellent.  Thanks. \n[379]Yes, I think that one may be. \n[380]Yes -- sort of... \n[381]What? \n[382]It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. \n[383]Oh sod a dog.  I've made the wrong decision, haven't I? \n[384]Max, how fast is your car? \n[385]No! \n[386]Is Miss Scott staying here? \n[387]How about Miss Flintstone? \n[388]Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead? \n[389]Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks. \n[390]Excuse me, where's the press conference? \n[391]Yes... \n[392]That's right... I work for their in- house magazine. 'Movies are our business.' \n[393]Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends? \n[394]And what would you say... \n[395]Yes, I just wondered whether if it turned out that this... person... \n[396]Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker realized he'd been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would... reconsider. \n[397]That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted. ", "Thacker": "", "Foreign": "\n[1]No. \n[2]Porque es un robot carnivoro psicopata.
