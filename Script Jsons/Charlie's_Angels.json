Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains. \n[4]I saw your car was here, so I knew you weren't carjacked and brutally beaten, left to die on the highway. \n[5] \n[6]But you can understand why I thought so. You missed our date last night. You didn't call or anything. I was just sitting there by myself. \n[7]I can tolerate a lot, but punctuality and attendance, those rank very high in my list of dating priorities. \n[8]Just once, I want to date a normal man, without a wife, or a drug addiction, or bondage issues. \n[9]I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made enough for three. \n[10]He's cute. \n[11]Any ransom? \n[12]Any chance you can join us, Charlie? \n[13] The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat, Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.  \n[14]Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type. \n[15]Here's Corwin's itinerary. \n[16]Hold that thought. \n[17]Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment. \n[18]Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping... \n[19]... isolate the part of the suspect's face that's revealed, then retriangulate his bone structure... \n[20]... and voila!     We've got a composite. \n[21]Keppler-Wilson. \n[22]Anytime. \n[23] \n[24]I'm working. \n[25]He's a bartender. I need dependable. I need reliable. I need a Volvo man. \n[26]Miss!   Miss!   I'd love some champagne. \n[27]What are you reading? \n[28]That's the new Michio Kazura. That's not even out in America. \n[29]Hello?    Warriors of the Broken Earth?   Classic. \n[30]Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen! \n[31] She turns and heads back.  \n[32]I'm Natalie. \n[33]Listen, there's an animation festival at the Egyptian this week. I was wondering if you might want to... \n[34]I'll meet you there. \n[35] \n[36]I'm on it. \n[37] \n[38] \n[39]You take point. I'll circle behind. \n[40] has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.  And then, a DING!  Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue- less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones. In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.  From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the panel.  \n[41]That way. \n[42]There are times I wish we carried guns. \n[43] right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.  \n[44]Hey!    Hands off, assh.... \n[45]Okay, to summarize? Damn. \n[46]No, it wasn't. \n[47]I've seen this before, he's scrambling his calls through a secondary location. \n[48]We need to tap this phone line at the source, THEN we'll know where his calls were coming from. \n[49]Bos, can we check a directory? \n[50]Hey look!   Mechanical bull. \n[51]Mind if I try? \n[52] \n[53] \n[54]Okay, new problem. \n[55]Thoughts, suggestions, points to consider? \n[56]There is no right. \n[57]If it goes down the mountain, that's all I need. \n[58]Oh God, no. \n[59]I have a date with Pete.   Right now. \n[60]\"Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a billionaire.\" \n[61]I'll sound like a flake.   I can't stand flakes. \n[62]You think? \n[63]Say, Fiji? \n[64]Sounds like a plan. \n[65] \n[66]I nicked him. Should give you enough time to do the deed. \n[67] Still hot on the Thin Man's tail, Natalie has the engine \n[68] Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.  \n[69]So you install a transmitter. \n[70]Patch in directly to the relay, broadcast on a high frequency. That way, you can have access to the mainframe from the comfort of your own home. And they have no idea that you can peek inside. \n[71]Only the two directors can disengage the fail-safe. We have to get their keys. \n[72]Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort? \n[73]Have to go.   Plans tonight. \n[74]Hey Dylan, can we talk to you for a second? \n[75]There's something going on between you and Knox. Isn't there? \n[76]Uh, yeah Dylan, it IS.    He's a client. \n[77]What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex, I can't believe you're siding with her. \n[78]You know Charlie would NEVER approve of this. \n[79]Thanks for the second chance. I swear, I'm really not a flake. \n[80]I bet there's a dozen women here who fit that description. \n[81]Really. \n[82]Ladies room.    I'll be back in two minutes. \n[83] \n[84] Who is perched atop the stall walls.     She pushed the door with her foot.  Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls into the next row of stalls.  Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles. He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over. That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.  With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.  \n[85]Who do you work for? \n[86]Speak now or never again. \n[87]National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA? \n[88]I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry. \n[89]Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not who she says she is. She's a former assassin and an all around bitch. \n[90]What?! \n[91]I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I get there. \n[92]Dylan... \n[93]Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for The National Security Agency? \n[94]Wait a minute. We installed the transmitter, yes, but we never gave him the receiver. \n[95]That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter. And we gave the laptop to... \n[96]I don't even want to think about what I'm thinking right now. \n[97]Not off a boosted signal. We'd have to be within 20 miles. \n[98]Hear that? That's a blue spotted egret. They only live in one place. \n[99]Nice work, Dyl. \n[100]Bosley's close. \n[101] \n[102]How do I get up to you? \n[103]Hello?... Pete, hi! How are you? \n[104]I did. I do.    I mean, thank you for calling. \n[105] \n[106] \n[107] \n[108]No.   Not at all. \n[109]You know, work this week has been really busy. It's been hard to focus. \n[110]See, the thing is, I'm not a full- time waitress. I should have been more up-front about that, it's just... \n[111] \n[112]You bitch!   I like that guy. \n[113] \n[114]I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy. But what you did is just wrong. \n[115] \n[116]Don't worry, we'll get him. \n[117]But Bosley, you HATE sports, why would you... You didn't buy them for yourself. \n[118]I always saw him as younger. \n[119]No, silver hair. And tan. \n[120]He's outside a lot. \n[121]How hard can it be to spot Charlie? \n[122]I got the floor. \n[123]Charlie? \n[124]Roger that, Alex, I'll stop the clock! \n[125] is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full- out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other cheerleaders. She's better.  \n[126]Give us the detonator. \n[127]Bosley!   Are you okay? \n[128] ", "Cook": "", "Vivian": "\n[1] \n[2]We need your help. \n[3]That's all fine in theory. But you still have to get inside that room to install it. What about security? \n[4]It sounds impossible. \n[5] \n[6]I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr... \n[7] \n[8]Sweet dreams. \n[9]NO! Not until I've got the information I need. We'll take him to the compound, hold him there. In the meantime, we've got to tie up some loose ends. \n[10] \n[11] \n[12]I see you take your bodyguarding services seriously. Still, I worry that no one is watching the door. \n[13]All the same, I'm concerned about Mr. Knox's safety. \n[14]Please, take a seat. I'm almost finished. \n[15] \n[16]Pity. \n[17] \n[18]Oh, shut up. \n[19] come running out onto the balcony, just in time to see Dylan jump. They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding thicket of trees.  \n[20]She can't have survived.   It's too far. \n[21] \n[22]Hate to disagree. \n[23]Is this the famous Charlie? \n[24]To be honest? \n[25]I don't care.

I don't get it, what kind of executive assistant is on 24 hour call? \n[9]You ask me, your boss is an asshole.

It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something? \n[15]The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me? \n[16]Hey.   Wait a second.   Come with me! \n[17]Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four. \n[18]Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there. \n[19]What if I changed all that? \n[20]What if I told you to quit your job, and come live with me. What I'm saying, Alex, is that I want you to... \n[21]Fine.  I'm fine. They're squibs, it's fake.   See? \n[22]Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene. \n[23]  \n[24]Alex?

But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate. \n[4]No, that's...That's okay. \n[5]He is. \n[6]Where do I hide it?

A HAND clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. It's the Thin Man. Bosley struggles, but in moments, he's unconscious.  \n[29]Angels!   Angels, can you hear me! \n[30]I don't know if you can hear me. I don't know if this thing is even working. \n[31]I know you can't answer, but... I really hope you can hear this. \n[32]I don't know where I am, really. I'm in a round room. The walls are white. Well. Not white-white. More of a cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes, I'm going to say vanilla. \n[33]I can see the ocean. \n[34]I don't know which ocean. I was blindfolded the whole time. We were flying. It must've been three or four hours. Maybe more. \n[35]Wherever it is, they have really good pudding. \n[36] Hearing her voice, the feral Bosley looks up.  \n[37]Natalie!   Is that you? \n[38]There's a staircase.

Except for the bobsled run, and the backwards part, it's going exactly according to plan. \n[57]I think we're in the clear. \n[58]Or maybe not. \n[59]What is it? \n[60]Ouch. \n[61]Call him, he'll totally understand. \n[62]He will so give you the second chance. \n[63]Hello, I saw the way he looked at you. \n[64] \n[65]Cocktail? \n[66]I think that earns us a vacation. \n[67]Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer if you could join us, Charlie. \n[68]We're good. \n[69]I've got surveillance on all the windows. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone. \n[70]Also, stay away from the windows. \n[71] \n[72]This is a panic button. Press it and one of us can be here in ten minutes. \n[73]Whoever's closest. \n[74]What? \n[75]I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry.     If you... \n[76]Don't be. \n[77]That's you, hunh? Cute kid.    Cute family. \n[78]Oh.   Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea... \n[79]But...? \n[80]Wow.   That's a lot for a kid to live with. \n[81]Boy did I have you pegged wrong. \n[82]Well, to be honest, I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. But that's pretty typical. I've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? Well... \n[83]Oh.   Well, you ARE, so... \n[84]No. But I... \n[85]I shouldn't. \n[86] \n[87]Thank you for dinner, Mr. Knox.    And lock the door behind me. \n[88]I'm on it. \n[89]It sounds like fun. \n[90]We need someone's help. \n[91] \n[92]Where you off to, Bos? \n[93]Um... well... \n[94]So what, so I like him.   Is that so wrong? \n[95]WAS a client.    We finished the job. \n[96]Uh, guys?   GUYS! \n[97]I'm a big girl. I make my own decisions. I'm going out with him. \n[98]Where's that music coming from? \n[99]Oh... Oh wow. \n[100] The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony playing something very romantic.  \n[101]That's amazing. \n[102]Maybe. \n[103]Well, I don't know what he looks like, but I feel like I know him. We all do. \n[104]Nope. \n[105]Of course, but believe me, it's impossible. I've tried. Let's not talk about Charlie, okay? Or work. \n[106]In fact, let's not talk at all. \n[107]Eric, it's Vivian. \n[108]Want me to tell her to come back, or... \n[109] as she pulls on her clothes, her CELL PHONE rings.     She grabs it.  \n[110]Hello? \n[111]Oh no.   OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE! \n[112]I'm at Knox's, she just showed up! \n[113]I can't do that. Call Alex and meet me here. \n[114] \n[115]I'm not much for games. \n[116]All this time, we thought Red Star was behind this, but it was you. You faked your kidnapping. \n[117]Why? \n[118]Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker. \n[119]I can't believe I trusted you. \n[120]I can't believe Knox tried to kill me. I mean, I've been lied to, I've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to SHOOT me before. I'm gonna get him for that. \n[121]And now, thanks to us, he's had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants, for God knows what reason. \n[122]Don't!  He's alive, he's gotta be.   If... What IS that? \n[123]Can we trace him? \n[124] \n[125] \n[126]Oh yeah? And I suppose you could do better? \n[127]Oh, right. \n[128]So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant plan? You gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder? Blackmail the President? \n[129]Revenge?   Against who? \n[130]Seems like you're going a bit overboard. \n[131]I don't know why you bother.   I've already won. \n[132]Every moment I sit here is a moment I'm using to figure out how to take you down. In fact, this statement -- this one I'm making right here-- is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I'm going to flatten first. It's gonna be the guy behind me. \n[133]By the time your guys are firing, I'll be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360, which will land me on Fat Boy there, as promised. He'll take the chair seat in the chin. Now... I'm warning both of you: I'm going to get you to shoot each other. I know. Cliche as that sounds. Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun. \n[134]You won't even be here. I mean, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal -- \n[135]Ah!   See? \n[136]Here we go. \n[137]Okay, that part worked. \n[138]Now, guys, I warned you. This is where you shoot each other. \n[139]Okay, here's where we improvise. \n[140]Damn! \n[141]You don't understand. He's got a pound of C-5 in that briefcase. \n[142]Not that I don't believe you, but how exactly do you know all this? \n[143]What do you think he looks like? \n[144]Definitely.   With black hair. \n[145]We'll know him when we see him, that's for sure. \n[146]Aw, shit. \n[147]We have to split up! \n[148]I'll take the mezzanine. \n[149] \n[150]I'll look for the bomb! \n[151] \n[152]Oh, shit. \n[153]Chartreuse and magenta.   This has gotta be it. \n[154]It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero. \n[155]Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one. \n[156]Charlie, no.   NO! \n[157]He's trying to say something. \n[158]Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's here... then where's Charlie? \n[159]Any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie? \n[160]To Charlie.

The red one or the blue one? \n[5]So the red one. \n[6]You saved the world again, Logan. \n[7]Let's have it rewritten. \n[8]Hello? \n[9]Not sure.   Whenever I can.      I'll call you. \n[10]A very good one. \n[11]Charlie's not very social. \n[12]Charlie needs me. \n[13]My hero. \n[14]What?    I've got a great relationship. \n[15]That way, he doesn't ask about my work. \n[16]So what's the catch? \n[17]Charlie, where do we start? \n[18]Kidnap the founder and you sink the company. \n[19]This is a transmitter. I'll be able to hear everything you say. \n[20]Try to get Corwin to talk about the industry, Knox, anything. \n[21]I know.   You'll do great. \n[22]You're carrying a lot of tension along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae. Let me see if I can vork it out. \n[23]The human body is an amazing instrument. Just by activating ze right energy points, you can improve ze circulation, alleviate pain, or... \n[24] \n[25]You must have dozed off. \n[26]Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot with that open head wound. \n[27]Don't bother. I know where it is. I used to spend every winter there. \n[28]That looks like our target. \n[29]I'm gonna need a distraction. \n[30]Where's Knox? \n[31]The calvary.     Giddy up. \n[32]Sorry.    Wrong room. Back!    Run! \n[33]Good news:   I found Knox. \n[34]Bad news:    I found company. \n[35]They're coming after us. \n[36]It's a bobsled run. \n[37] \n[38]\n[39]Hard left! \n[40]We're at the bottom! \n[41]We couldn't have done it without you, Bos. \n[42] \n[43]Consider it done. \n[44]Even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it. There's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there. It could take days. \n[45]Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight. Key- card badges throughout. Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping. \n[46]Then we have to get back into Red Star. Problem is, their biometric sensors are too good. \n[47]It's done. Red Star's mainframe is open for business. \n[48]Me too. \n[49]She's got a point. \n[50]I'm not siding with anyone, but technically, he is no longer... \n[51]Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care. I think you're just being overly cautious. \n[52]Me too. \n[53] \n[54]We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine. \n[55]Come with you? \n[56]Jason, I don't... \n[57]It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and... \n[58]Gunfire!   Get down! \n[59]My God, you're hit. You're... \n[60]Sorry about that, I... \n[61]Nice, Alex.   Real nice. \n[62]Hey, is someone firing more squibs or... \n[63] crouched behind a wall.  She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason. Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the way across the building, where there's a fire exit.  Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.  \n[64] Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams. She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the two-by-fours in half.  \n[65]He played us from the very start. It was all just so he could get us to tap into Red Star. He couldn't figure out a way to do it himself. \n[66]What? \n[67]Come on, Bosley, answer. I've tried all his numbers and paged him five times. No answer. \n[68]Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are. \n[69]Bingo. \n[70]Florida. \n[71]You heard the man. \n[72]You find him.    I'll get Dylan. \n[73]The question is, where's he headed? \n[74]You bought them for... \n[75]Sixty, tall, well-built. \n[76]He's not George Hamilton. \n[77]IF we see him. \n[78]I'll take the luxury boxes. \n[79] \n[80]Jason? Shit. \n[81]Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles Townsend? \n[82] immediately goes to intercept him, but...  \n[83]Jason, hi, I... \n[84]Can I talk to you later? \n[85]I'm sorry, I... \n[86]Jason, please... \n[87]Jason, get down! \n[88]Right now, just by leaning forward, I could crush your windpipe. You'd die a slow and painful death. You don't want that, do you? \n[89]Where is the bomb, when's it going off? \n[90]Hi, Jason.   Gimme one second? \n[91]Angels! Knox planted the bomb in the basement, and it's timed to go off when the game clock hits zero! \n[92]I lied to you Jason.    I'm not a secretary. \n[93](referring to the \n[94]I'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building.
