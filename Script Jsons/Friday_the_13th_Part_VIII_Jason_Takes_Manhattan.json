The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at \tSean.  \n[3]\t\tThis voyage is doomed.  \n[4] \tas Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a \tcorner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His \teyes instantly brighten, as do hers.  \n[5] \tas J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to \tfind the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, \treacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.  \n[6] \tas the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of \ther demise, followed by discordant feedback from her \tguitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast \tpocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of \tEarly Times.  \n[7] \tWind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of \tdecorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES \n[8] \tas they walk along the edge of the pool.  \n[9]\t\tHe's come back and you're all going to \t\tdie.  \tRennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.  \n[10] \tas we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through \tit. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the \tpeople.  \n[11] \tas LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera \tslowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second \tlater, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.  \n[12] \tas Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching \tonward.  \n[13]\t\tYou're all going to die.  \tAll heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from \ta shadowy corridor.  \n[14]\t\tYou're the last ones. He's come back \t\tfor you.  \n[15]\t\tJason Voorhees.  \tThere is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by \tthe infamous name.  \n[16]\t\tHe walks this ship, here and now.  \n[17]\t\tYou're the one who's insane!!  \tThe raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch \traises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's \tarm, stopping him.  \n[18] \tas Rennie moves past wet, empty lounge chairs towards the \tbow. She passes a row of translucent windows. The first \tthree are normal...but the fourth has the SILHOUETTE OF \n[19] \t--spying on Rennie like a wolf watching a lamb. We MOVE a \tfew windows down, getting a better view of her.  \n[20] \tRennie appears again, scanning her no-visibility \tsurroundings.  \n[21] \tas it slams open...and JULIUS steps out, not Sean, from a \tdifferent deck door. TRACK with him as he treads along \tthe side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.  \n[22] \t--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. \tMiles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.  \n[23] \tas Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his \tsurroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON \tRIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.  \n[24] \tHe's pacing along when a clattering noise from above \tmakes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE \tMAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, \tjerking his head upward.  \n[25] \tas Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.  \n[26] \tcoming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his \tstomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:  \n[27] \tas a door opens and Miss Van Deusen guides a half-dozen \tSENIORS over to the LIFEBOAT STATIONS.  \n[28] \tWe slowly DOLLY BACKWARDS until Miles' AXE comes into \tframe, still stuck in the mahogany decking. A beat, then \n[29] \t...and the charge EXPLODES INTO HIS CHEST. He stands \tthere with his chest smoldering, almost like a gargoyle \tin effigy. A second later the poor old man falls forward, \tand:  \n[30] \tas rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S \tFOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, \n[31] ", "Hand": "\n[1]\t\tThis voyage is doomed.  \n[2]\t\tHe's come back and you're all going to \t\tdie.  \tRennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.  \n[3]\t\tYou're all going to die.  \tAll heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from \ta shadowy corridor.  \n[4]\t\tYou're the last ones.

The force of it sends the \tboxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...  \n[9] \tgroping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering \tacross her table like a spider.  \n[10] \tHer movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But \tRennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: \tthe ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen.

A second later the poor old man falls forward, \tand:  \n[12] \tas rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S \tFOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN, \n[13] ", "Jason": "\n[1] \tWritten by Rob Hedden   \n[2]\t\tHhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...  \n[3]\t\tMmmmmmommy....  \t...And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.  \n[4] \n[5] \traises the spear, taking aim.  \n[6]\t\tHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...  \n[7] \tWe're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, \tmoving through it, behind the generators.  \n[8] \tmoving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather \tpants as she bends over to plug in her axe.  \n[9] \tappears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes. \t\t\t\t \n[10] \temerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.  \n[11] \tswings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.  \n[12] \n[13] \tas the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the \tempty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's \twindow. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at \tthe backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, \tslipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the \ttiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby \tand the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF \tRENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, \tfacing us point-blank, and:  \n[14] \tholding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it \tforward with one more staccato jerk and:  \n[15] \thovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling \tknives.  \n[16]\tHe begins to stride parallel to her, then disappears \twhen the windows end and a wall takes over.  \n[17] \tdeciding that the time is right to strike. His hand moves \tto the bow entrance door knob, slowly turning it, pulling \tit open.  \n[18] \tthrough the crack in the door, watching Rennie \tunexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when \tha hears:  \n[19] \tmoving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva \tbefore she turns a corner and disappears.  \n[20] \tchasing after her with the smooth determination of a \tshark, never letting her get too far in the lead.  \n[21] \t--entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in \tthe direction of the disco. He tramples onward.  \n[22] \tappears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The \tspotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's \tgone.  \n[23] \tilluminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe \tassaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course \twith him.  \n[24] \thoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:  \n[25] \tWayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING \n[26]\n[27] \tHe's having no problem catching up to the defenseless \tteenager.  \n[28]\tSLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the \tboxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...  \n[29]\t\tHhhhelp....me....  \tRennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:  \n[30] \t...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his \thands reaching out to her. But then comes the \tinexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND \tJASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her \troom, choking on murky water.  \n[31]\t\tHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...  \n[32] \tgrabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.  \n[33] \tHer head is pulled taut against the wall just below the \tporthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the \tcircular shattered window. She's slowly dying.  \n[34] \tas Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP \tINSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason \tinstantly releases her, reeling backwards.  \n[35] \tMiss Van Deusen is darting across the deck, gathering up \ta trio of terrified seniors.  \n[36] \n[37] \n[38] \trapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's \tview is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.  \n[39] \ttrampling towards the hoist, about thirty feet away now. \tThe boat has already disappeared over the edge.  \n[40] \tas he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his \taxe.  \n[41] \tstanding by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very \tangry.  \n[42] \tA tattered billboard over one of the warehouses \tadvertises the NEW YORK RANGERS HOCKEY TEAM, featuring a \tfull shot of the HOCKEY-MASKED GOALIE.  \n[43] \tlooks at it long and hard. He tears off his life \tpreserver wits renewed ambition.  \n[44] \tAmongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded \tsyringe. Jason picks it up.  \n[45] \tHe's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.  \n[46] \t...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the \twrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.  \n[47] \tappears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT \n[48] \tas the automobile grinds back over him a second time.  \n[49] \tas the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over \this head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL \tDRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips \tMcCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface \tof the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the \tdrum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason \treleases him, moving on.  \n[50] \tas an ELDERLY COUPLE rises toward us. Their reactions \tgrow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering \tterror as we plow right through them.  \n[51] \theaves the dog in front of the train.  \n[52] \t--seeing Sean and Rennie disappear through another \tconnecting door. We storm our way through it into the \tnext car right after them. A handful of TRAVELERS cower \taway from us.  \n[53] \tfires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. \tRennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages \tto latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. \tJason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as \tRennie watches helplessly.  \n[54] \ttrips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, \tRECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and \tconvulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be \tterminated!!!  \n[55] \tshoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; \tthey've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. \tHe moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some \trap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates \ttheir stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull \tout switchblades and chains.  \n[56] \tlifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO \n[57] \tRennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's \tflashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in \tthe reflective wet surroundings.  \n[58] \thas been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.  \n[59] \tas the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down \tthe intersecting tunnel .  \n[60] \tstomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's \twanted to kill Rennie most of all.  \n[61] \tHe's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling \tafter his fix.  \n[62] \t--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into \tTunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie \tflinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second \tlater a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...  \n[63] \tand his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, \tSEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if \ther were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank \tbuckshot.  \n[64] \tas the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the \tplastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT \n[65]\tHIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the \tchemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his \teyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs \tfrying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just \tbroke, running down his face.  \n[66] \tvision or no vision, he is lurching towards her \trelentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell \tand high water.  \n[67] \twithin ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder \tlike he's working on some kind of radar.  \n[68] \thas just started to climb the ladder when the wind and \tsmell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His \tdecomposed head swivels to face:  \n[69] \tHe doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses \talready know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE \n[70]\t\tMmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, \n[71]\t\tHhhhelp me....  \tA split second later:  ", "Voorhees": "", "J.J.": "\n[1]\t\t\t \t\tIs this axe awesome or what?  \n[2] \tas J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band \"Vixen,\" \tcontinues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black \tleather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding \tthe camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing \tthe latest hip prescription glasses.  \n[3]\t\tNo lie. I hear there's a big power \t\troom down below where I can get \t\tsupreme concert hall echo. Come down \t\tand shoot a basement tape on me, okay?  \n[4]\t\tMan, don't tell me you're still trying \t\tto scam on Tamara...  \tHis non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, \tgrabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.  \n[5]\t\tHow long have we known each other? \t\tDon't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not \t\tinterested in you, only what you can \t\tdo for her. She's a user.  \n[6]\t\tSo's this guitar. So what?  \n[7]\t\tThis place is aching for a video. \t\tWayne, you're an asshole.  \tShe finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.  \n[8] \tpops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the \"play\" \tbutton. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.  \n[9] \tscreams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with \ther playback. The generators are causing a breeze which \tmakes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. \tShe's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending \tthe high \"E\" string above the upper octave fret. She \topens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:  ", "Jarrett": "", "Sean": "\n[1]\t\tIt's a ship and that's right. Plus a \t\tdisco, gym, game room and a lot more.  \n[2]\t\tWhich cabin is Rennie in, Mr. \t\tMcCulloch?  \n[3]\t\tBut I thought...  \n[4]\t\tBe right up, Dad.  \tHe and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving \tMcCulloch one last glare.  \n[5]\t\tHello, Dad.  \n[6]\t\tDad, I don't think...  \n[7]\t\tHow about if we start up the forward \t\tengines and come around. 180 \t\tdegrees...  \n[8] \tas he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK \tHAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at \tSean.  \n[9]\t\tYeah, tell me about it.  \tSean sidesteps him, moving on.  \n[10]\t\tRennie...  \n[11]\t\tI heard you weren't coming.  \n[12]\t\tI got you a present.  \n[13]\t\tForget it. It's a dumb little thing \t\tanyway.  \tRennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace \twith a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.  \n[14]\t\tI thought maybe we could hike to the \t\ttop of the Statue when we got there, \t\tif you felt like it. It's supposed to \t\tbe 22 stories tall.  \n[15]\t\tI guess I'll see you later.  \tSean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out \tto the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she \tpsyches herself up to look.  \n[16]\t\tWhat happened? \t\t\t \t\tRennie, are you okay?  \n[17] \tas Rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing \tin terror.  \n[18] \trealizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after \ther, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van \tDeusen helps to lift her out.  \n[19]\t\tIt's okay...you're going to be okay.  \n[20]\t\tMe too. \t\t\t \t\tLet's go talk to my Dad.  \tHe puts his arm around her, leading her toward the \tbridge.  \n[21]\t\tNot completing a voyage is against \t\teverything he stands for. But I think \t\tI can convince him to call a Coast \t\tGuard cutter for you.  \n[22]\t\tIf I go with you, he'll never \t\tspeak to me again. \t\t\t \t\tBut I'm never going to live up to his \t\texpectations anyway...so maybe it's \t\tthe right thing to do.  \tHe's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they \twalk on.  \n[23] \tknocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He \tpushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean \tputs his weight into it, shoving hard.  \n[24]\t\tOh Jesus...Dad??  \tSean looks over at the helm...where his father is still \tsitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. \tSean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward \this father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.  \n[25] \tSlowly walking toward Admiral Robertson...at least he \tthinks it's his dad because he's unable to see his \tface. Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's \tabout two feet away from him...  \n[26] \treaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his \tfather BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers \tbackwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We \tMOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching \tonto him tightly.  \n[27]\t\tHe's...he's dead...  \n[28]\t\tAttention everybody, attention. This \t\tis Sean Robertson...  \n[29]\t\tThere's been... \t\t\t \t\tWhat I mean is, this is an \t\temergency...  \tMiles knows he can't be joking around. Wayne comes \twalking by, covering his camcorder with his jacket.  \n[30]\t\tRepeat, this is an emergency...  \n[31]\t\tI want everybody to meet on the \t\tbridge...  \n[32]\t\tStay calm, but get here as quick as \t\tpossible. Walk with a friend if you \t\tcan...  \tEva wipes the rain from her face, then walks away.  \n[33] \ttrying his best to keep it together. He glances at his \tdead father, still unable to believe it.  \n[34]\t\tGod, I wish this was a joke, but it's \t\tnot.  \tSean slowly puts down the phone. He's lost in a daze. \tSuddenly the SHIP LURCHES, a huge swell SPLASHING THE \tBRIDGE WINDOW. Admiral Robertson's body falls from the \tswivel chair.  \n[35]\t\tI don't know...we've gone off course \t\tor something...  \n[36]\t\tI don't know what I mean! All's I know \t\tis that there's no one guiding this \t\tship anymore...  \tSean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean \tguiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking \thim.  \n[37]\t\tI think so. But we have to lower the \t\tanchors so we don't drift any \t\tfurther...  \n[38]\t\tThe bow...front of the ship. There's a \t\thoist on each side that lowers them  \tShe starts to exit.  \n[39]\t\tI didn't mean for you to go!  \n[40]\t\tMayday, mayday, mayday...  \n[41]\t\tPlease...can anybody out there hear \t\tme??  \tNo response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.  \n[42]\t\t\t \t\tChannel 16...the distress frequency... \t\t\t \t\tMayday, mayday, mayday...this is the \t\tPrincess Ruby. Please, somebody \t\tanswer...  \n[43] \tas they hear the voice, reacting, relieved and thrilled.  \n[44]\t\tThe Captain and Chief Engineer... \t\tthey've been...they're dead.  \n[45]\t\tI...I don't know...  \n[46]\t\tYes...  \n[47]\t\tI've got the numbers.  \n[48]\t\tHello? Are you there??  \tNo response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.  \n[49]\t\tIt's...dead.  \n[50]\t\tShe's...she's dropping the anchors. I \t\tthought the Coast Guard could find us \t\teasier if...  \n[51]\t\t\t \t\tI don't know.  \n[52]\t\t\t \t\tWe could hit a reef, collide with \t\tanother ship...we could be out here \t\tfor weeks before anybody spotted us.  \tThey are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch \tstorms onto the bridge.  \n[53]\t\tIt worked...we're back on course!  \tSean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van \tDeuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time \tlater:  \n[54]\t\tThe fire alarm...  \n[55]\t\tWe have to get everybody together just \t\tin case the fire's for real.  \tSean heads for the door, shoving it forward.  \n[56]\t\tRennie...??  \n[57]\t\tIt's gonna be okay...  \n[58]\t\tThe power room...  \n[59]\t\tRule one, don't panic. Rule two, \t\tassess the damage and act \t\taccordingly...  \n[60]\t\tI don't know.  \tHer ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. \tSuddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.  \n[61]\t\tThe emergency lights just kicked in...  \tSean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant \tto convince himself as much as Rennie.  \n[62]\t\tWe'll be okay. I want you to wait by \t\tthe lifeboats, just in case.  \n[63]\t\tBut Rennie...  \n[64]\t\tWater has gotten to the engines. \t\t\t \t\tWe have to get everybody off this \t\tship...  \n[65]\t\tThis is Jason's fault!  \n[66]\t\tWe have to get off this ship!!  \tThey back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, \tthe Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.  \n[67]\t\tEverybody in -- I'll get the hoists  \tMcCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the \tlifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing \tclassy-eyed at the small boat.  \n[68]\t\tStop it!!  \n[69]\t\tCome on...faster....  \n[70] \tgrabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.  \n[71]\t\tStart rowing!!  \tMcCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto \tRennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks \tup at the ship again, and:  \n[72] \tJason is none.  \n[73]\t\tHe's gone...  \n[74]\t\tIt's Julius!  \tMiss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:  \n[75]\t\tRennie...what'd they do to you??  \n[76]\t\tWe have to find the others.  \tTogether they run off.  \n[77]\t\tHey!  \n[78]\t\tJason's here in New York.  \n[79]\t\tThere aren't any handles!!  \tCocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts \thyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just \tas:  \n[80]\t\tMiss Van Deusen...  \tHe takes two steps back to the car when:  \n[81]\t\tYou son of a bitch...  \tShe lets it build until she's ready to explode...then:  \n[82]\t\tYou keep away from her!  \tSean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK \tTO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. \tHe wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE \tSHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.  \n[83]\t\tNot this time.  \tHe caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. \tFinally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same \ttime:  \n[84] \tare lost in their shared quiet moment...until the \tGROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:  \n[85] \tabruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.\t  \n[86]\t\tCome on...  \t...but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and \tsnarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He \ttreads toward them and:  \n[87] \tmakes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the \tplatform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention \tto them. They reach the end of the platform, having no \tchoice but to board the front car.  \n[88] \tas they get to their feet, holding each other tight, \tlooking down on the now-dead undead creature.  \n[89]\t\tIt's over, Rennie. It's finally over.  \tCamera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. \tGuess who has just made an encore...with more energy \tthan ever!!!  \n[90] \tlook all around them, having never been to a city as big \tas this.

Jason Voorhees \t\thas been dead for over thirty years.  \n[41]\t\tA killer walks this ship indeed. And \t\tit's certainly none of us...  \tThe crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him \tsuspiciously.

You sent her out there with a \t\tmurderer running around loose??  \n[47]\t\tYou had me worried to death!  \n[48]\t\tI'm the one you should be listening \t\tto!

That's \t\tall I care about.  \n[51]\t\tThis isn't a request.  \tHe closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, \tlocking the dead bolt.

You'd think he'd be able \t\tto operate this thing!  \tSean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind \tand temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of \tSean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He \tchecks the Omega and LORAN.  \n[54]\t\tWell?  \tSean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. \tHis father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the \twheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of \tbuttons on the console.  \n[55]\t\tWhat's that?  \n[56]\t\tCan you shut that damn thing off??  \tSean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around \tfor the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees \tMcCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.  \n[57]\t\tI doubt very much that one even \t\texists.  \n[58]\t\tUse some common sense! Setting off a \t\tfire alarm causes panic...the same \t\tkind of panic caused by suggesting \t\tJason Voorhees is on board. \t\t\t \t\tEnough is enough.  \tHe marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill \tswitch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He \tgrabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van \tDeusen.  \n[59] \talmost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged \tinto blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. \tHe passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, \tspotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the \tshadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, \tclutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.  \n[60]\t\tRennie??  \n[61] \tThe room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered \tacross her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up \tto the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his \tattack...but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to \tsomething across the room. The bathroom door is afar.  \n[62] \tcautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the \tknob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears \tsomething, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. \tMcCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few \tseconds pass.  \n[63]\t\tCome on, answer!!  \n[64]\t\tWhat did you do with Rennie??  \n[65]\t\tShe never should've set foot on this \t\tship. This is your fault!  \n[66]\t\t\t \t\tNot another word, do you hear me??  \n[67]\t\tWhy aren't you with the others, \t\twoman??  \tFinally the message comes forth:  \n[68]\t\tJason Voorhees is dead!!  \tA PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind \tthem, the words unintelligible.

Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, \tthen hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing \tthe ladder.  \n[75]\t\tA wonderful choice of places to dock a \t\tboat, Mr. Robertson.  \tSean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.  \n[76]\t\tYou heard him! We have to call the \t\tpolice  \tJulius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows \tMcCulloch\tis right.  \n[77]\t\tEveryone split up -- we'll cover more \t\tground that way.  \n[78]\t\tMy niece's life hangs in the balance \t\tright now!! Every second counts.  \tNo more rebuttal. They hurry off.  \n[79]\t\tIt's okay -- she's with me.  \tShe turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.  \n[80]\t\tRennie, thank God...  \tBut Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter \tpill for McCulloch.  \n[81]\t\tDon't be ridiculous!  \n[82]\t\t\t \t\tYes.  \n[83]\t\tHe's a walking corpse, a phantasm from \t\thell.  \tThe others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen \tturns to the confused policeman.  \n[84]\t\tRennie, for God's sake slow down!!  \tShe doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her \teyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.  \n[85]\t\tPerfect for a swim, isn't it?  \tShe frowns at him, looking away.  \n[86]\t\tYou've been coming out here every \t\tsummer for the last three years, young \t\tlady, and you still haven't learned \t\thow.  \n[87]\t\tThat's what you said last year.

And ready to pull \t\tdown anybody who falls in and can't \t\tswim.  \n[91]\t\tAm I? Let's find out.  \t...And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH \n[92]\t\tBetter swim before Jason drags you \t\tdown, Rennie. Come on, you can do \t\tit...  \t...but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep \tfrom sinking under the surface.  \n[93]\t\tYou can and you will! Swim, Rennie!  \n[94]\t\t\t \t\tI was only trying to teach you. But I \t\tpulled you out, Rennie. I saved your \t\tlife.  \tRennie just stares, incredulous.  \n[95]\t\tYou...are...NOT POSSIBLE.  \tBut possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS ", "Wayne": "\n[1]\t\tToo cool, J.J.

Wise \t\tup -- it's not hip to be her friend.  \n[19]\t\tI'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.  \tHe hurries on.  \n[20]\t\tWhat are you taking, Julius?  \n[21]\t\t\t \t\tWe're talking the possibility of Jason \t\tVoorhees here.  \tJulius pauses. He's not stupid.  \n[22]\t\tJ.J. -- you down here?  \n[23] \t--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down \tthrough the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.  \n[24] \tlies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his \tbleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself \tto a standing position again.  \n[25]\t\tWe got a major problem, Wayne.  \n[26] \tHis vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than \tcrisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily \tforward.  \n[27] \ttakes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs \tleading down to the next level. And when he arrives \tthere...  \n[28] \n[29] \tinstantly raises the rifle and FIRES...  \n[30] \t...and the body goes down. He's hit him!  \n[31] \tstands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, \tlooking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to \tadjust the eyepiece diaptor.  \n[32] \tas the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, \tfinally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- \tthe same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. \tHe's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, \tnot a knife.  \n[33] \tslowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his \tthroat.  \n[34]\t\tNo...  \tHe raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will \treveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.  \n[35] \tHe gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS \tFRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split- \tsecond glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then \tthe camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES \n[36] \tscreams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, \tpicking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. \tWayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over \tsomething, bringing with it a harsh strum from an \n[37] \tSure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a \tblood-streaked Gibson Flying V.  \n[38] \t--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his \thands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin \tup through his scalp.  \n[39]\t\tNo no no...  \n[40] \n[41] \twhich bobs up in front of her. Rennie cries out, \tscrambling to grab onto Sean as what's left of Wayne's \tbody washes past them.  ", "Webber": "", "Rennie": "\n[1]\t\tMe too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles \t\twill be.  \n[2]\t\tWhat about not-so-great writers?  \tRennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen \tgrinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far \tbetween, this one disappearing as she glances out the \twindow.  \n[3] \tas the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread \tout before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes \tacross it occupied by two indistinguishable people.  \n[4]\t\tJust felt a little chill.  \tRennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.  \n[5]\t\tReally?  \n[6]\t\tThat's wonderful, Miss Van \t\tDeusen...what's it about?  \tShe parks the car, turning off the ignition.  \n[7]\t\tI don't know what to say...  \n[8] \tas she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart \tpounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look \tout at the lake again.  \n[9] \tThe ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer \tnow.  \n[10] \tcontract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a \n[11] \tleans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.  \n[12]\t\tI just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.  \tShe continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, \twatching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to \tMcCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.  \n[13] \tcontinues along the starboard side, not risking another \tglance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK \tHAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes \tfollowing her like a crazed raven.  \n[14]\t\tHi, Sean.  \n[15]\t\t\t \t\tWe changed our minds.  \tSean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are \tobviously in the early stages-of a relationship. \tSean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small \tnecklace-sized box.  \n[16]\t\tBut I didn't get you one...  \n[17]\t\tSean...it's beautiful.  \tSean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.  \n[18]\t\tI'd love to.  \n[19]\t\tI'm staying.  \n[20]\t\tShe didn't push me into coming.  \n[21]\t\tI don't even know why I'm afraid, \t\tUncle Charles. I can't even remember \t\twhen it started. Don't you think it's \t\ttime I found out and got over it?  \tHe takes a measured pause.  \n[22]\t\tI'm staying.  \tHe's not going to change her mind.  \n[23] \tthrough a porthole window...and through the viewfinder \tof a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning \taway from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric \tguitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he \tpasses the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE \tUP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson \"Flying V.\"  \n[24] \tNo inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her \tdog, who's curled up on the bed.  \n[25]\t\tWhat do you think...time for some \t\tpersonal experiences to fuel our \t\tminds?  \tThe dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.  \n[26]\t\tI agree.  \tRennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and \tsome black satin pants.  \n[27] \tfeels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:  \n[28] \tare distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back \tat the porthole, she sees:  \n[29] \tsnaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is \tfrantically clawing with his fur up.  \n[30]\t\tOkay Toby, calm down...  \tShe's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie \tcloses the curtains on her window, then steps to her \tdoor. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes \tan empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, \tdashing off down the hall, snarling.  \n[31] \tappears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. \tIt's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the \tcocaine, trying hard to ignore it.  \n[32]\t\tHave you seen my dog? I think he came \t\tthis way.  \n[33]\t\tNo thanks.  \tRennie continues on. After she's gone...  \n[34] \tas she presses on, the corridor getting darker.  \n[35]\t\tToby?  \tNo reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway... \tbut camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON \tREVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. \tHe's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in \thalf, providing a splintery sharp shaft.  \n[36]\t\tHave you seen my dog anywhere?  \n[37] \tas they walk along the edge of the pool.  \n[38]\t\t\t \t\tYeah...a lot.  \n[39]\t\t\t \t\tThere's something I haven't told \t\tyou...  \t...But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is \tshoved from behind.  \t\t\t\t  \n[40] \tflounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror \tshe's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for \thelp.  \n[41] \tShe's can't even hear Sean, her vision being splashed by \tthe chlorinated water. She sinks under the surface, \tturning around...AND COMING FACE TO FACE WITH YOUNG \tJASON. The eight year-old corpse GRABS HER ANKLE AND \n[42]\t\tI can't swim.  \n[43]\t\tIt's not that simple.  \n[44]\t\t\t \t\tWhenever I get near the water, I see \t\tthis young boy drowning. He tries to \t\tpull me down with him.  \tThe teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful \tpause.  \n[45]\t\tAbout four years ago...at Crystal \t\tLake. I spent a few summers there with \t\tUncle Charles inbetween boarding \t\tschool.  \n[46]\t\tNo. It was just a normal summer. I've \t\tnever been able to figure it out.  \n[47]\t\tIt wasn't her fault.  \tHe gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a \ttowel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around \this niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.  \n[48]\t\tJust...leave me alone...  \tShe pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and \tfrightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with \tscorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.  \n[49]\t\tIt's not real, it's not real...  \n[50]\t\tI want to go home. I want off this \t\tship.  \tAfter a moment...  \n[51]\t\tCan he really take us home?  \n[52]\t\tWhat about you?  \n[53] \tas Miss Van Deusen steps up to Rennie's door, gently \tknocking.  \n[54]\t\tWhat is happening???  \tSean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, \tlooking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them \tbefore.  \n[55]\t\tWhat do you mean???  \tAnother wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful \tpanic.  \n[56]\t\tCan't you call for help??  \tSean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing \tfrenetically.  \n[57]\t\tWhere are they?  \n[58]\t\tJust radio for help, okay???  \tShe hurries out the door, working on terror-induced \tadrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing \tthe keying button, speaking into the mike.  \n[59] \tmoving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us \tas well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at \tthe consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.  \n[60]\t\tToby?  \tShe turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the \tside of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after \tToby.  \n[61]\t\tToby? Where'd you go?  \tNo sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to \tthe anchors again.  \n[62] \tis oblivious as she reads the directions above the \tcontrols.  \n[63] \tremains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating \tcorrectly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of \ta HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.  \n[64]\t\tBut Sean said...  \n[65] \tas McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging \ther door open.  \n[66]\t\tCan't we at least talk about it?  \n[67]\t\tBut what about the drowning boy I've \t\tbeen seeing?  \tHe avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering \ther across the threshold. She's standing inside her room \tnow; he's in the hallway.  \n[68]\t\tI'm not staying in my room, Uncle \t\tCharles.  \n[69]\t\tUncle Charles!  \tHe ignores her, briskly walking away.  \n[70] \tas she throws her fists against the door a final time, \trealizing it's futile.  \n[71] \tas the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody \telse's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, \tworking up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip \ton them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE \tIS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he \thurries off.  \n[72] \tas Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming \tthat it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; \tshe begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER \t...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:  \n[73] \tstands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a \tmagnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a \tdeep lake, and extends her arms to him.  \n[74] \tfeels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her \teyes expanding because she's now looking at:  \n[75]\t\tHhhhelp....me....  \n[76] \tscreams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, \twatching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.  \n[77] \tdisappears under the surface of the water...which seconds \tlater CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.  \n[78] \tgroping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering \tacross her table like a spider.  \n[79] \tHer head is pulled taut against the wall just below the \tporthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the \tcircular shattered window. She's slowly dying.  \n[80] \tHer movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But \tRennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: \tthe ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen. She \tseizes it, getting a firm grip.  \n[81] \tsinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far \taway from the porthole as possible. She makes it across \tthe room to her stateroom door just as:  \n[82]\t\t\t \t\tThe window...  \tSean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, \tseeing nothing. He steps back to her.  \n[83]\t\tI don't understand what is happening \t\tto me...  \tShe breaks down; he holds her.  \n[84] \tThe ship noticeably rocks from the explosion. Rennie \tclings to him fearfully.  \n[85]\t\tWhat is it??  \tOne second later, the lights begin to flicker.  \n[86] \tSean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room, \ttrying to think, talking to himself.  \n[87]\t\tIs the ship going to sink??  \tHe returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.  \n[88]\t\t\t \t\tI'm not going near any lifeboat!  \n[89]\t\tI'm not!!  \n[90]\t\tI...I can't...  \n[91]\t\tToby...  \tShe climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, \tMcCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.  \n[92] \tflailing her arms in the water right next to the \tlifeboat, drowning.  \n[93]\t\tHhhhelp...me....  \tSuddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW, \n[94] \tShe gazes in utter shock, screaming:  \n[95]\t\tNo!!!  \tThey all follow her eyeline...but the water is calm, \tnothing there.  \n[96]\t\tNo!  \tShe pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet \n[97]\t\tPlease don't...  \n[98] \topens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as \tblood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of \ther, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At \tthe same time:  \n[99] \tshoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his \tattention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT \tAT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily \tdisorienting him. Rennie sprints away.  \n[100] \tBlurry, disoriented, erratic. Suddenly A FIGURE JUMPS OUT \n[101]\t\tDrugs... \t\t\t \t\tThen Jason came. He's here, Sean.  \tOh Jesus. He never expected this.  \n[102] \tHer vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set \ther target. We come straight at the abominable creature \tand:  \n[103] \tslams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT \n[104] \tstomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A \tHALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, \tlooking out the front window...  \n[105] \tdesperately throws it into forward again, gripping the \twheel and RACING FORWARD.  \n[106] \tThere's a FIGURE standing in the distance. But it looks \ttoo small to be Jason. We RUSH TOWARDS IT, CHANGING INTO \tSLOW MOTION JUST BEFORE IMPACT. The figure is a dripping \twet boy with a sinister smile. YOUNG JASON.  \n[107] \topens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body \tcharring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She \tnumbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something \tmakes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt...  \n[108] \tA pool of gasoline has collected, flames dancing across \tits glassy surface. Suddenly a TINY ROWBOAT DISSOLVES IN, \tnot unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of. The \trowboat glides across the surface of the burning \tgasoline, TWO PEOPLE RIDING IN IT. The flames and asphalt \n[109] \tShimmering water, clouds and pine trees reflected in it. \tThe rowboat floats into view. The two occupants are YOUNG \tRENNIE and MCCULLOCH. She's wearing a bathing suit and an \tinnocent smile. And not an inkling of fear about the \twater. She stands, letting the sun soak into her.  \n[110]\t\tWhat a beautiful day.  \n[111]\t\tI'll take some lessons this time. I \t\tpromise.  \tShe bends over, splashing the water.  \n[112]\t\tHe is not.  \n[113]\t\tYou're telling a lie.  \n[114] \tHer uncle's face blurs and clears as water splashes her \teyes.  \n[115]\t\tI...I can't...  \n[116] \tis too panicked to obey.  \n[117]\t\tHhhhelp...me....  \tShe coughs on some water then disappears...  \n[118] \tYoung Jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her \tdown. The whole image BURSTS INTO FLAMES and we:  \n[119]\t\tYou pushed me...  \n[120]\t\tHe was down there!!!  \tAnd Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean \tgrabs him, shoving him down.  \n[121]\t\tI was at school when they told me. \t\t'Rennie, we have some very bad news... \t\tyour parents have been killed in an \t\tauto accident.'  \tSean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.  \n[122]\t\tIt seems like everybody I care about \t\tends up...  \tShe can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the \tforehead, then makes her look into his eyes.  \n[123] \tare lost in their shared quiet moment...until the \tGROWLING SOUND becomes audible. They look up, seeing:  \n[124]\t\tToby...  \tShe starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS \n[125]\t\tWhat's wrong, boy?  \tAnother protective growl, then:  \n[126] \tabruptly flee down the alley, Jason in mad pursuit.\t  \n[127] \tshrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just \tas the train roars by.  \n[128]\n[129] \truns straight towards the track pit like a football \tpunter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON \n[130] \tas they get to their feet, holding each other tight, \tlooking down on the now-dead undead creature.  \n[131] \tlook all around them, having never been to a city as big \tas this. They finally turn far enough around to spot \tJASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer \tthan the last.  \n[132]\t\tSomebody help us!! He's going to kill \t\tus!!!  \tBut the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, \tbustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to \tflee again.  \n[133]\t\tPlease, hurry...  \tA telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.  \n[134]\t\tYou don't understand -- there's a \t\tmaniac trying to kill us!!!  \n[135]\t\tLook!  \tShe's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They \thaven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the \tcover back as Jason comes forth.  \n[136] \tcarefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it \tanother ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, \tGRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through \tthe tunnel.  \n[137] \ttries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the \topposite wall, barely conscious.  \n[138] \tbacks away but does not run. The time has come to face \ther fears.  \n[139]\t\tYou never got me in the lake, Jason. \t\tAnd you're not going to get me now \t\teither.  \tHer voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the \tirritating light never leaving us.  \n[140] \tdrops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.  \n[141]\t\tGet up, Sean!!!  \tHis eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable \tterror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING \tSOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the \tdirection of her planned retreat:  \n[142] \tAn ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the \tunthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at \tleaps and bounds.  \n[143] \tas her trembling chin rises, looking at:  \n[144] \trotates her head and sees:  \n[145] \tdrags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed \twoman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to \tthe intersecting alcove wall.  \n[146]\t\t\t \t\tClimb!!!  \tShe shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning \teverything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare \tback down the tunnel...  \n[147] \tThe overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake \thas just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her \tvision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING \tFROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms \tlike the claws of a roto-tiller.  \n[148] \tslips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and \trushing higher. She takes her final glance into the \ttunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as \tshe sees:  \n[149] \tThe powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches \tbelow Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking \ttheir rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with \ttheir eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.  \n[150] \tas the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her \teyes, glancing straight down and seeing.  \n[151] \tThe ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a \tPAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops \tfurther, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR \tOLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, \tprobably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he \tdrowned in Crystal Lake.  \tJason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.  \n[152] \twalk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their \tpursuer. But something, some innate perception causes \tRennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid \tfear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...  \n[153]\t\tOh Toby...  ", "Wickham": ""}}
