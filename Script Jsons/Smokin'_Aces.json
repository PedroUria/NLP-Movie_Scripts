What did you say! \n[5]Jesus Hugo! \n[6]How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man! \n[7]Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!? \n[8]Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that? \n[9]Look at the collar on that coat... \n[10]What's that look like, that stain? \n[11]Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz... And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket. So y'got semen, human ejaculate-- \n[12] \n[13]...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out. Now, the money question...To whom does that stain belong? \n[14]C'mon, somebody was banging one of these skanks, sans rubber-- -which is terrifying in its own right- pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined the last gift my mother gave me before she died. The way I see it, it's the same as if she was dug up, three months dead and it was shot right on her rotting corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled this feels! \n[15]I was kinda hoping, yeah. \n[16]Only if you really, truly mean it. \n[17]Are you a fucking colossal idiot? \n[18]Without peer? \n[19] \n[20]Get the phone, it might be Gill, then get out of my sight. \n[21]No. The cards can stay there. Get The Goddamn Phone. \n[22]\n[23]Don't tell me to \"calm down\" Ivy! I hate that! \n[24]Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno... \n[25]Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update. Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed . ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink... \n[26]Are you on a land line? \n[27]Just checking...what's up?   What's wrong with your voice? \n[28]...About what? \n[29]I'm not doing cocaine. \n[30]That's not possible. I told you. \n[31]Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry. \n[32]--Fine, fuck, I got it...Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport. \n[33]Be cool, be cool, be cool...c'mon... \n[34]Just this last little bit, then we're done, just this tiny bit and that's it, that's it, all of it, over-- \n[35] \n[36]That's right! RIGHT NOW! \n[37]They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off! \n[38]Bullshit it is. I said, about as loud as I could say it, \"no jail time for my guys.\" \n[39]--and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you. \n[40]I don't have to do shit!

He'll be there. \n[46] \n[47] \n[48]They're getting close. It's down to a handful of deal points now. \n[49]--I dunno the way it's gonna play out, but-- yeah, it'll probably go something like that. \n[50]...what are you tryin' to say? \n[51]That's probably him now... \n[52]A set of skills, God-given gifts, I close my eyes. \n[53]King of Clubs...You pick up this deck, s'just playing cards, I pick up this deck it's a living, breathing thing.

So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom. \n[5]Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler...I like your chances a lot more. \n[6]That's already happened hoss.

Two months after stepping off a Greyhound, she gets knocked up by some hood. \n[2]Biological abandons her and the showgirl thing goes sideways so she winds up working as a magician's assistant to make extra cash. \n[3]...And young Buddy learns everything about cards from this Mandrake motherfucker his mom is working for... \n[4]But magic man was also a degenerate gambler and got caught dealing bottom- deck at a mob-owned poker parlor. He didn't get outta there with much more than a pulse. \n[5]Point is, he passed on all this slight of hand shit onto Aces and the kid is sick with it...By the age of twelve Buddy Israel is positively prodigal with a deck of cards. By sixteen, he's headlining the MGM's main room. \n[6]This punk is pulling down ten bills a night and more showgirl geech than you can shake a stick at. Four years of sold-out shows, he becomes the unofficial mob mascot \n[7]By the tender age of twenty-one he's breaking bread with the wheels, keeping company with major muscle. And it goes to his head in a big way \n[8]...Wiseguys start to think this sonofabitch is a mystic, something special...and Aces plays it up, lets the legend grow, takes time off from his stage act and starts showcasing the chip on his shoulder. \n[9]He buys into his bullshit, building street cred, he's got plans and pull, he's makin' plays, living the mob life for real. Somehow, it takes: Lounge act turned legitimate thug. \n[10]In reality, he doesn't know the ball from the bounce...He's not a crook, so he starts fucking up fast and picking up speed, putting a floodlight on the whole Carlotta organization. Cops get curious, start camping out, compiling names and faces and pretty soon Israel's bullshit has brought the heat to bear on none other than Primo Sparraza-- \n[11]...Then I'm sure you've heard of these guys...The Tremor brothers. \n[12]No? Then you've both been living under the same rock, 'cuz these cocksuckers are infamous. Three brothers, same skank mom, different deadbeat dads, used for that suicide-kamikaze style shit. You heard about that huge shoot- out in Cleveland? \n[13]The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally. \n[14]Donald McGarey, the local union rep, is the mark. The Tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club, seven people dead, twenty-eight wounded. Just to get to this one guy. \n[15]--And they get it about as good as they give it. In the melee, one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed piece and is temporarily blinded, the other takes bullets to the lower back and can't walk. The third gets popped in the neck and passes out. McGarey gets out of the club alive...and not much further... \n[16]They're speed freaks, neo-nazi's. Sworn to the swastika, supposedly read and recite \"Mein Kampf\" like Mother Goose...And these motherfuckers can go megaton at the drop of a hat. \n[17]So what do you think? \n[18]The bond on Israel expires in eighteen hours, after that, it's a jump ball.

Reed just gave us fifty grand. \n[29]Your attitude sucks. \n[30]Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks. There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift.

Killer. \n[2]Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of \"The Turnpike Murders\" that was Sparazza. \n[3]No. He worked for the O.S.S. before joining the Bureau in its heyday. He was the first operative assigned with infiltrating the mob. \n[4]Full immersion and assimilation, fake identity, falsified background, everything that is now standard operating procedure, Heller implemented, way back when. \n[5]And as a result, his undercover work was wildly successful. He eventually reached the rank of Capo inside the Carlotta crime family...but through some internal slip-up, his cover was compromised and Primo Sparazza was given the contract to kill him. \n[6]There wasn't enough evidence to bring formal charges, so the case never went to trial. \n[7]Sparazza is a bit of a specter. Over the years, the serious crimes with which he was thought to be involved, including Heller's murder, could never be traced back to him. \n[8]A dedicated viciousness and a slavish devotion to mob doctrine had Sparazza's star on the rise. So the mob relocated him to Nevada and he became the unofficial head of the Las Vegas LCN. \n[9]Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks. \n[10]...His hand-picked protege, successor to the throne...and Israel played the situation very shrewd. \n[11]...Slowly amassing the loyalties of Sparazza's top men...with plans of toppling the throne. \n[12]In doing so, he plunged the Carlotta organization into a civil war, splitting the family into dual factions. Sparazza on one side, Israel on the other. The infighting that followed drew the interest of nearly every major investigative body operating under the canopy of the federal government. \n[13]Presently there are sixteen state and federally funded agencies, running concurrent criminal probes on select members of the LCN...With Israel \n[14]being the primary target in virtually every investigation. \n[15]His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection. \n[16]--Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing...The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real. \n[17]Like Pasquale Acosta, blood money mercenary. His countrymen have dubbed him the more dubious \"El Estrago\" The Plague. \n[18]American educated, fluent in over a dozen languages, did journeyman's work for CIA funded \"G-2\" and \"Archivo\" death squads in Guatemala and Chile...noted for his legendary torture techniques. \n[19]Sought for war crimes and human rights violations in eighteen different countries. When he was caught by the SAS in Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and ID'd by Interpol. \n[20]On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished. \n[21]Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that... \n[22]We lose our case. Twenty-four hours from now, he's scheduled to meet with federal prosecutors. His agent, a man by the name of Morris Mecklen, has guaranteed us that he'll enter into protective custody once his deal is approved. \n[23]We've been monitoring Mecklen's calls and have learned that Israel is staying in the penthouse level of the Nomad Hotel and Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada under an assumed name. \n[24]Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas...that can't happen. We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe. It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano-- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel. \n[25]...But understand that if an attempt is made on his life... \n[26]...then it is being made by those of the strictest professional caliber... \n[27]...They are cold-blooded, ruthless, and without restraint...and they must not succeed. \n[28]...Yes? Yes sir...I'm looking at it now...what does this-- mean exactly? ...What? ...Good God... ..Good God... No, the two of them attached, Agent's Carruthers and Messner. I'd like to notify them immedia-- \n[29] \n[30]Pasquale Acosta-- Mercenary-- \"El Estrago\"-- \"The Plague\" \n[31]When he was caught by the SAS in Northern Ireland and imprisoned, he chewed off his fingertips to the bone before he could be printed and ID'd by Interpol. \n[32]Soot? \n[33] \n[34]Where are Carruthers and Messner? \n[35]Account for him. \n[36]Here. Sit.   Please. \n[37]Difficult to explain everything now... And much larger issues loom. I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest thing to have to die for. \n[38]  \n[39]We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days. \n[40]...for a press release. Officially, he took his own life, suicide by hanging, something of that sort. Basic bullet points-- despondent over the turn his career had taken, troubles with the law, history of substance abuse and so on-- \n[41]What are you doing here? \n[42] \n[43]You were given instructions to get on that plane and return to Washington-- \n[44]I can't discuss-- \n[45]You're finished. \n[46]...They're father and son... \n[47]--Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by-product of. \n[48]...He does now... \n[49]Dr. Sven Ingstrom is head of cardiology at Stockholm University and the foremost heart specialist in all of Europe-- \n[50]Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice. \n[51]Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. \n[52]Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll. \n[53]Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we-- \n[54]...Are you insane? \n[55]It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive...Look at the date of the first procedure. \n[56]The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller... \n[57]Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover. \n[58]He survived the shooting but the injuries he sustained triggered a degenerative bone disease that required constant surgery, forever altering his features...so he assumed his alias full-time. \n[59]The figment that was Primo Sparazza became flesh and blood. Freeman Heller was no more. \n[60]The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable...until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove. \n[61]I wouldn't go that far. \n[62]Israel's agreement with the government was tossed out. We're now attempting to rehabilitate him to the point where a transplant can be attempted. \n[63]No...We're trying to save Heller. \n[64] \n[65]I don't see it like that at all. \n[66]I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed. ", "Serna": "\n[1]Buzzy...Buzz...? \n[2]You got clicks, anything? \n[3]--Okay...hang on, I gotta move-- \n[4]Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop. \n[5]Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there--  \n[6]--yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose--  \n[7]So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a \"specialist\" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.  \n[8]Trust me, we keep our mouths shut, go about our thing, play the part, nobody suspects us. The old man's on the fade Buzzy, fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I don't like saying that, but hey, our livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get?  \n[9]Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?  \n[10]Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up...Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ. \n[11]--who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate. \n[12]Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave. \n[13]Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down. \n[14]Yeah, I can front this. \n[15]That's the punchline, y'ready? \n[16]A million flat. \n[17]None whatsoever. \n[18]--so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can-- \n[19]Buzzy...Buzz...? \n[20]Right, you got clicks, anything? \n[21]So how we lookin'? \n[22]Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh? \n[23]That's what we're countin' on. What'd they say when you went for specifics? \n[24]Okay-- yeah, I can, I respect that. \n[25]Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so-- \n[26]--in a foot race right now. Really a matter of who out hustles who, y'know... \n[27]Basically-- it'd really be the best thing right now, yeah. Can't give up the ship now Buzzy-- \n[28]Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel. \n[29]Bag this fucker Buzzy. \n[30]--some Swede, real badass, supposedly a \"specialist\" ", "Richard": "", "Messner": "\n[1] \n[2]I thought Heller was a double op? \n[3]So he's personally issued the contract on Israel? \n[4]A marked man gets wise and wants to come in. \n[5]So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart? \n[6]Like who? \n[7]You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit? \n[8]...Then we lose our witness. \n[9]It's the last place they'd look. \n[10]Anything on the Swede? \n[11]Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record. \n[12]I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to...they're playing some long odds. \n[13] \n[14]No rest for the wicked. Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this? Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one-- \n[15]--look at this, look at the work he's had done; nose, three times, eyes, eyelids, chin, jaw-- he's had his jaw done a dozen times. \n[16]You take every hasbeen actor in Hollywood they haven't been cut this much. \n[17]Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny-- --A paternity suit...I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be. \n[18]Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west. \n[19]But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one? \n[20]Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked. \n[21]So he has no idea what's about to happen? \n[22]What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management. \n[23]He's giving them up? \n[24]Did the Justice lawyers sign off? \n[25]What about the sheriff's task force? \n[26]Double homicide, gunshot vics, both of 'em dumped in the lake. That's where the Sheriff's task force is. \n[27] \n[28]Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers in the car with me. You need to hear this. \n[29]What kind of uniforms? \n[30]Alright, deputy, we'll be there as soon as possible, until we arrive, I need you to limit physical access and restrict movement to and from the crime scene. Clear? \n[31]Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security? \n[32]You going up to the Penthouse alone? \n[33]No, no clarify. What is \"an emergency requisition of surrounding personnel?\" Within one-hundred mile radius, understood-- Sacramento, Reno, Carson City. So in less than an hour, we're going to have anywhere from forty to fifty odd field agents arriving, without the slightest inkling as to why they're here. Is that correct? Am I misinterpreting that or-- No, I'm not blaming any one person, this is Bureau directive. But Agent Carruthers is the SAC and he's out of cell range at the moment, so I can't contact him to-- Very well. I need to get Deputy Director Locke on the phone as soon as possible. \n[34]Who's this? \n[35]What are these? \n[36]Then we've got a third man missing. \n[37]What car? \n[38] \n[39] (beat, to another \n[40]This him? \n[41]--Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now? \n[42]  \n[43]Did he give you his name? \n[44] \n[45]Who? \n[46]This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent? \n[47]You're sure? \n[48]And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets-- \n[49]And that didn't seem odd to you? \n[50] \n[51]Do it. \n[52]\n[53]Two man cover formation, far end, the elevator is open, possible aggression inside, watch for fire-- \n[54]--watch for fire... \n[55]Stay low, breach on my mark... \n[56]\n[57]\n[58]How bad? \n[59]No. \n[60](re: Acosta, yelling \n[61]\n[62]...Deputy Director Locke? \n[63] \n[64] \n[65]Your friends were taken to Carson City Memorial, they're going to be autopsied and shipped back for burial. \n[66]Who owned this car? \n[67]Where are they now? \n[68]Where's that? Home. \n[69]You're injured...Let me drive. \n[70]Where's Israel? \n[71]My debrief-- \n[72]--no, we need to handle it now. \n[73]You're going to tell me why no call was made to inform us that the Israel situation had been \"altered.\" Why I-- and my friend and partner, whose body is going into a furnace tomorrow, were not sufficiently apprised of Bureau movement on this matter. \n[74]--You can and you will. \n[75]And you just figured that out? The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant...why? \n[76]...A paternity suit, filed 1967... \n[77]...Does he know? \n[78]So the wiretaps of Padiche and Serna-- \n[79]So all of our intel was bogus to begin with. \n[80]...When did you know all this? \n[81]--What? What do you mean \"Who Sparazza actually was...\" \n[82]...Almost. What do you mean \"who Sparazza actually was...\" \n[83]You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one-- \n[84] \n[85]  \n[86]...So you made another deal? \n[87]But you did, and have...And now people are dead. Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel...and did you make another deal? \n[88] \n[89]...So you knew all this and yet y-- \n[90]...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us... The way they betrayed him... \n[91]No, of course you don't...of course you don't. ...I gave all my belief and the better part of my soul to this Bureau. ...Look at the monsters you've made... I won't be one of them. \n[92]No...It's not. "}}
