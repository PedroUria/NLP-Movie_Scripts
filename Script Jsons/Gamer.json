I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye. \n[53]\n[54]Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way. \n[55]There's a delay... \n[56]Whatever you call it.

The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again... \n[10]The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse? \n[11]We can't let that happen. \n[12]You can help us, Tillman. You have to help us. \n[13]That would be like cutting out part of your brain. \n[14]The nanocells replace the cells they replicate... they become you. \n[15]We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears. \n[16]Alright.

He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue. \n[3]You like the software? \n[4]The walkie talkie, playa. \n[5]That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said? \n[6]Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him? \n[7]We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game. \n[8]Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know. \n[9]Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out... Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen. \n[10]You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit. \n[11]Mm hm. That's right, it's a game. You want to win it, don't you? \n[12]Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa. \n[13]Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct. \n[14]A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit. \n[15]The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me? \n[16]Then let's rock, baby. \n[17]  \n[18]You a fool. \n[19]Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail. \n[20]It's a game of deception. \n[21]Whatever, that's cuz you got no power... \n[22] \n[23]Bullshit. \n[24] \n[25]His name's Tillman. \n[26]Whatever.

Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human. \n[35]But this is only the beginning. \n[36]Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line. \n[37]This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us. \n[38]Hell no. \n[39]They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him.

Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after. \n[52]They tested it on soldiers... the first volunteer was Corporal Travis Scotch - a friend of yours, I believe. \n[53]The second was you. \n[54] \n[55]Dig me, Tillman.
