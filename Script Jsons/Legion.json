I quit two years ago. \n[6]It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I'm sentimental. I don't wanna forget how much I hate her guts. \n[7]Goddamn it.

And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone. It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep.

Maybe they got some news about the TV. \n[31]Not if it was centered in the desert. \n[32]Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off. \n[33]Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something. \n[34]Whaddya talkin' about? \n[35]You're shittin' me. \n[36]Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about.

Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. \n[53]Jesus. \n[54]Least now we know where that smell was coming from. \n[55]Okay, now we're talkin'. \n[56]Give me the shotgun. \n[57]Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. \n[58]Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. \n[59]Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see `em! \n[60]Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then. \n[61]Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half. \n[62]So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car? \n[63]Back off, fella...

All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on. \n[83]Just gimme another minute with him, okay? \n[84]What the hell are you talkin' about?

She ever tell you his name? \n[93]Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her. \n[94]Can't a father be wrong sometimes? \n[95]I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you... \n[96]Who? \n[97]Don't do it, lady! \n[98]Sonuvabitch! \n[99]Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here, remember? \n[100]Run. \n[101]Sorry...   We're closed.

Bob raises the shotgun. \n[5]That how you greet all your customers? \n[6]Michael. \n[7]You don't know, do you? \n[8]I'm running out of time. \n[9]They're here. \n[10]You're going to need this. \n[11]He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice. \n[12]If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say. \n[13]When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety. \n[14]Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks. \n[15]Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. Understand? \n[16]Get ready! \n[17]Now!   Shoot now! \n[18]Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows! \n[19]No...     Not anymore. \n[20]I told you not to do anything brave. \n[21]Someone needs to be on the roof. \n[22]The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time...he sent what you see outside. \n[23]I'm saying this is an extermination. Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn. \n[24]No...by angels. \n[25]That's where your book is wrong. \n[26]I know because until last night, I was on their side. \n[27]Not anymore... \n[28]That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either. \n[29]Not you... Her. \n[30]Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving. \n[31]Exactly. \n[32]None of that matters anymore. Either your child lives or Mankind dies. \n[33]That's right. \n[34]We won't have to... \n[35]If you want to live you'll do what I say. This first attack was a test of our strength. The next one will be a test of our weakness. Something much worse is on its way. \n[36]We'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two. Jeep, go get some tools. We need to close up this window before somebody else goes out. \n[37]I was a soldier, a general, in His army. \n[38]I was given an order I didn't believe in... He lost faith. I hadn't. \n[39]Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it. \n[40]It's almost time for the next shift. \n[41]No.    We're not going anywhere. \n[42]We can't risk being on the move when the child comes. It's too dangerous. \n[43]I don't think so. \n[44]Don't.

We have to hurry. \n[53]Charlie, I need you to push. I need you to push as hard as you can. \n[54]We're almost there... \n[55]Take him... Give her a minute. \n[56]No. Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun. Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness. \n[57]You'll need to teach him how. \n[58]Each of us has a burden. This one is yours and yours alone. Maybe someday you'll understand what that means. \n[59]The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me. \n[60]Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come to do what I wouldn't. \n[61]There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope. \n[62]No, Jeep! You must protect the child now! \n[63]My path ends here. You are the true protector. You always have been. \n[64]Find the Prophets.   Learn to read the instructions. \n[65]I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him. \n[66]To not feel their burden...is a dream. \n[67]The child lives.

Parents hated him. \n[16]My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving. \n[17]They thought a more \"wholesome\" environment would help me \"change my ways.\" So fucked up.

The rate we're going, we'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas. \n[7]I'm sure it's a mistake. \n[8]Maybe there was an earthquake? \n[9]They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one. \n[10]Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry about. \n[11]Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas? \n[12]Who the hell do you think you are, lady?! Now, I'd like you to apologize to my -- \n[13] \n[14]Sandra?    What's happening? \n[15]Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice Cream Man. \n[16] \n[17]Help me, please! ", "Minivan": "\n[1] ", "Boy": "\n[1]Mister... \n[2]  \n[3]I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to! \n[4]You're gonna die now. \n[5]C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby. \n[6] ", "Gabriel": "\n[1]Unlike you...the rebellious son. Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now. \n[2]You think you can defy Him and not pay the price? \n[3]Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape. And neither will you, brother. \n[4]There is no other way... \n[5]You always wanted to live like one of them...Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them. \n[6] \n[7] \n[8]Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away. Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his fists. This kid will simply not give up. Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground. \n[9]So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself. \n[10]Go to sleep... \n[11]\"And as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world.\" \n[12]The creature is gone at last. The sound of a BABY COOING. Charlie picks the child up out of the brush. She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge.

You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. \n[7]Am I in the right place? \n[8]Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works? \n[9]I can handle that.   You got pancakes here? \n[10]Three seventy-five, huh? \n[11]If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em. \n[12]Hey man? \n[13]Can I use your phone? My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted. \n[14]Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you have a phone or not? \n[15]Let me talk to him... \n[16]  (strange STATIC can be \n[17]What the hell... \n[18]I don't think so. \n[19]Phone's dead.

Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death! \n[22]How far to the hospital? \n[23]They're fuckin' clouds!   What the fuck do they look like? \n[24]Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us. \n[25]How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence. \n[26]No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. \n[27]Agh!

What the fuck is wrong with white people?! \n[30]Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man. \n[31]I'm from Nevada, man. \n[32]Know what? \n[33]Easy!   Easy! \n[34]What the--? \n[35]Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do? \n[36]Where the hell did they go? \n[37]Ice cream. \n[38]You've got to be fuckin' kidding me. \n[39]  \n[40]Oh, shit.

Demons? \n[47]So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out? \n[48]Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked! \n[49]Okay, what's your plan? \n[50]You were in the Army? \n[51]What was it like?    Being in a war? \n[52]What? \n[53]No. I uh -- keep it for protection. \n[54]From people. \n[55]Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know? \n[56]Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people. \n[57]I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin? \n[58]Exactly.    Strictly business. \n[59]Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. \n[60]...Then you just flip this -- \n[61]I bet they did. \n[62]Yeah? \n[63]The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did? \n[64]I got really good at being bad. \n[65]I don't know. \n[66] \n[67] \n[68]Get ready. \n[69] \n[70]It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap! \n[71]Hey! Get back in your car!      It's a trap! \n[72]I got you! \n[73]Kyle drops to his knees. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls.

About your dad. About me... \n[5]See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. \n[6] \n[7]Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is. \n[8]You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders. \n[9] \n[10]Guess I should think `bout quittin' then. \n[11]You can buy a whole pack inside. \n[12] \n[13]Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'. \n[14]Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though. \n[15]Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. \n[16]I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left. \n[17] \n[18]Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for? \n[19]That's for sure. \n[20]Where do I start? \n[21]Yeah, in the Fifties. \n[22]Don't look like a test. \n[23]Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing. \n[24]Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am. Specials are on the board. \n[25]Okay, what'll it be? \n[26]And how'd you like that cooked? \n[27]Coming right up. \n[28]Yeah. \n[29]So they say. I'll be right back with your water. \n[30]Just about there. \n[31]I wouldn't know. \n[32]Out of sight. Out of mind. \n[33]Nope. \n[34]No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do. \n[35]I've got it under control. \n[36]What did you just say? \n[37]Go to hell, lady. \n[38]Total fucking Jesus freak. \n[39](nods, peakish, to \n[40]Oh, thank God, the police! \n[41]We don't know anything. Nothing's working here. The TV, the radio, the phone... \n[42]Let `em go! \n[43]Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, losing her grip on Howard's belt. Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl. \n[44]  \n[45]Thanks... \n[46]He brings them here and then he saves us from them? You're a genius, Bob. \n[47]Me?!   Why me?! \n[48]No way! \n[49]  \n[50]Go fuck yourself, Bob! \n[51](approaches Michael, panic  \n[52]That can't be.

I even went down to the clinic, you know that? I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran. For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me. \n[59]How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? \n[60]We have to get `im back in here! \n[61]Oh, no.   Audrey... \n[62]Do you have no heart?!     She's just a kid! \n[63]You can't let her die! \n[64]Michael! \n[65]I'll get some water! \n[66]Where is he?! \n[67]Oh, no! \n[68]I don't...I... \n[69]So are we safe now?   Is it over? \n[70]And what happens until then...? \n[71]What makes you think I can do that? What makes you think I want to do that? If he's so important, why don't you take him? \n[72]What's he talking about? \n[73]Michael, what the hell's he talking about?! \n[74]Audrey...? \n[75]Give him to me! \n[76]No...   I... \n[77]Wait!     We can't leave him! \n[78]Come on, Jeep! \n[79]Is this what I think it is? \n[80]Jeep, your arm! \n[81]What is it? \n[82]The swarm, it's fading! \n[83]Look, I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn't mean it. \n[84]C'mon, Jeep! \n[85]Jeep! \n[86]Alive. \n[87]Nothing could have survived that. \n[88]She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! \n[89]How can this happen? \n[90]How can this happen in a world so beautiful? \n[91]Stop!   Please! Don't kill him! \n[92]Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY! \n[93]I don't want this responsibility! \n[94]Yep, we sure did. \n[95]Taking it in.     Breathing hard. \n[96]What if we're on our own now? \n[97] \n[98]Someday when my son is older, I will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness... \n[99]...
