If we don't go over there and take a look, this might be the last night you got a home.  Now trust me. \n[154]Now all we gotta do is find out where the little one put that pump.  Take it and see what's in it. \n[155]It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. \n[156]Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us.
