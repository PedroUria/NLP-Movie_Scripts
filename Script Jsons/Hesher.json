I've been stalking you for half an hour. You gonna try to fuck her? \n[60]Can't fuck her from here, dude. Gotta be way closer. \n[61]You wanna poke her clam? \n[62]You wanna poke her clam or what? \n[63]You want to poke her clam, dude. Nothing wrong with that. Don't be ashamed about it.

See you later. \n[90]   \n[91]Your sexy girlfriend's in trouble. We're not going anywhere. \n[92]You know, TJ? \n[93]  \n[94]This one time I had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and I had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like I had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while I'm trying to eat the other girl out, and I was going crazy man. It was too much. I couldn't work out which chick was which and I'm making one girl cum but then I'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually I was just like 'Fuck this. This is too much' and I just stepped back. I just stepped back. And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. They're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and I jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know? \n[95]A what? 61. \n[96]I saw a mouse. \n[97]We're here. Come on, let's go. \n[98]My uncle's house. 62. \n[99]What was what? \n[100]Wrong house. \n[101]What? You're dirty. \n[102]You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in... \n[103]Now I'm dirty and wet too. 63. \n[104]R2! Shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level! \n[105]...All the fucking trash compactors...  ...on the detention level!... \n[106]Oh, shit. More trash coming in! \n[107]Oh shit! \n[108] \n[109]\n[110]Shit, look at that. \n[111]I got a doctor's appointment. \n[112] \n[113]So did you fuck her? \n[114] Did you finger her twat? \n[115] \n[116]This is delicious. 73. \n[117]What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \n[118]What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \n[119]Oh, OK. \n[120]Did you figure it out yet? \n[121]What's green and slimy and smells like bacon? \n[122]Sure, what? 74. \n[123]Kermit the frog's finger. \n[124]Think about it... Miss Piggy. \n[125]Woah, what's that? \n[126] \n[127]No shit. \n[128]I'll be right back. \n[129]May I? 75. \n[130]It's a bong. The water filters the smoke. It's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed. \n[131]OK, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in. \n[132]Then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible, OK bro? \n[133]Ok, lift your finger. \n[134]Yeah, that was good. Hit it again. 76. \n[135]Who wants to know? \n[136]Who? \n[137]Aren't you? \n[138]Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK, well I used to have a mouse. No, wait... hang on a minute. I used to have a snake. And do you know what snakes eat? \n[139]Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat mice. 77. \n[140]Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to have a snake and I fed it mice. But one time I fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough. I dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know... \n[141]With his little mouse hand. So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. And so eventually the snake starved to death. I had a cage full of mice. \n[142]Maybe he is. \n[143]You're an old lady. 78. \n[144]Yes you are. And you know what grandmother? I'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning. \n[145]I'm not going anywhere. I'm going with you. Around the block, I guess. \n[146]No, I'm going with you. \n[147]Grandma? 82. \n[148]\n[149]I gotta get the fuck out of here before I hurt someone. \n[150]Hey, hey... wait. \n[151]Hey! The fuck are you doing? 86. \n[152]Stop hitting my van. \n[153]Dude, chill out for a second. \n[154]I wanna talk to you. \n[155]I fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this! \n[156]Don't fuckin' touch m- 89. \n[157]Fuck you both! Motherfuckers! \n[158]Hello. \n[159]What? \n[160]I just saved you. \n[161]Only a bit, it's just a cut. \n[162]What are you talking about? \n[163]What's your problem? \n[164]Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's speech. I think I know where he was going with that. \n[165]Hey, hey, hey... \n[166]What are you doing? Get your fuckin' hands off that box. \n[167]Um... 105. \n[168]You touch me again, I'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you. \n[169]Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't want me here and I don't want to fucking be here, but I'm not here for me, I'm fuckin' here for her- \n[170]- and I'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how I want to say goodbye to someone I like - in this shit-hole with these- \n[171]- fuckin' assholes. \n[172]Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause I'm going to say what I want to say and then you'll never see me again. Alright?! 106. \n[173]I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down. \n[174]I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that. \n[175]I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit. \n[176]And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out. 107. \n[177]All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too. \n[178]You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut. \n[179]Fuck this. \n[180]Leave her alone. We're not finished yet. \n[181]I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it! 108. \n[182]You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance. \n[183]Get your hands off me, pig. \n[184]    ", "Paul": "", "Grandma": "\n[1]There's still plenty of applesauce boys. \n[2]It's OK dear. He just needs time. It's his first day back tomorrow. Lets try and be patient. \n[3]One thing at a time dear. One thing at a time. \n[4]  \n[5]Hi, pumpkin. \n[6]How was your day? \n[7]Why sweetheart? \n[8]Do I look like I'm sitting in darkness here? \n[9]Maybe I need new glasses? \n[10]Actually, I don't even know if these are mine. \n[11]Geez, I don't know. \n[12]Jesus, I don't know. \n[13]You know my mother always told me that I'd damage my eyes if I read by poor light and I always think about that when I'm reading, but I've gotten this far, so why am I still worrying about it? Why am I even reading? There's something more I need to learn? \n[14]I guess there's always something more to learn. 15. \n[15]Is is your dad up yet? \n[16]Well, you know, sometimes people get knocked off course a little when bad things happen. But they come good in the end. \n[17]Here's some milk to wet your whistle. \n[18]Take some applesauce, sweetheart. \n[19]TJ, would you please pass me the salt? \n[20]Did you know that when Albert Einstein interviewed people for a job, he would take them out for lunch and if they put salt on their food before tasting it, he would not give them the job. \n[21]I've always liked that. 17. \n[22]Hi, TJ. What you doing around the back? \n[23]Your Dad's gone to the supermarket, honey. Everything OK? \n[24]I'm gonna make a cake. Do you remember my cherry cake story? 27. \n[25]I used to make a cherry cake all the time and it always came out just wonderful. One time I invited my doctor and his wife and I wanted to make an impression. I asked him to come see your dad in a play and he came and I said, 'would you like to come back to the house?' \n[26]And he said, or his wife said, 'yes they'd like to come back.' So earlier that day I made a cherry cake and I used a - I didn't know it till afterwards, I used a new product - instead of Crisco, I used Fluffo. They never made it again that Fluffo. \n[27]Oh, of course honey. \n[28]Hello there. \n[29]Does your friend want to eat some dinner dear? \n[30]Are you sure? \n[31]That's great honey, it's nice having a bit of music in the house again. Is he a new friend? \n[32]You know your grandfather played the harmonica for many years. \n[33]Hesher, would you like a glass of orange juice. \n[34]Morning, TJ. \n[35]Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of milk. I can cook you up some eggs if you like, dear. \n[36]Would you like to come for a walk with me today? \n[37]No, I mean later. This afternoon. \n[38]OK, honey. \n[39]- and his wife said, yes they'd like to come back to the house.' So earlier that day I made a cherry cake and I used a new product - I didn't know it till afterwards- I used Fluffo. They never made it again that Fluffo. It was an imitation brand. I served the cake and there was silence. And then - \n[40] \n[41] \n[42]So who's coming for a walk with me tomorrow morning? \n[43]\n[44]Ok, well you're always invited. 37. \n[45]He's right TJ, it'd be very good for you to get some fresh air. \n[46]Why would anyone rape me? \n[47]Hi, honey. How was your special group? \n[48]  \n[49]Hi TJ. \n[50]Boys please, I'm not feeling well. \n[51]Did I miss something? \n[52]Those boys have been through a lot. \n[53]Sometimes I wonder if they're ever gonna smile again \n[54]I just wish there was something more I could do. \n[55]Thank you, dear. \n[56]I don't know, dear. \n[57]A worm? I don't know. I'm going to lie down. I'm not feeling well. I'm very nauseated. \n[58]  \n[59]Figure what out, dear? \n[60]No, not yet dear. Can you do me a favor? \n[61]Will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear? \n[62]What? \n[63]Oh, I'm feeling very nauseated. They're medical cigarettes that help me with the nausea. Will you light a match for me, dear? \n[64]What is that? \n[65]Umm, OK. \n[66]Oh, wow... That was a big one. \n[67]I think I'm OK, dear. \n[68]Honey, how old are you? \n[69]I don't know. You seem a little older than TJ. \n[70]Oh, stop it. Aren't you a little old to be hanging around TJ all the time? \n[71]No, I'm his grandmother. \n[72]Actually, there's no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat. Whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes. Depending on their growth, their diet - \n[73]They do eat mice. A lot of times snakes eat other snakes because they're the right shape - \n[74]So is TJ the mouse? \n[75]Well then, what am I? \n[76]No, I'm a grandmother. \n[77]Oh, that's nice.

It's locked! \n[112]You fucking ditched me. \n[113]What the fuck's wrong with you?! \n[114]What's wrong with you? \n[115]Yeah, but - \n[116]  \n[117] Yeah. \n[118]What about? \n[119]What for? \n[120]But I didn't do anything. \n[121]Not really. \n[122]I didn't do it. \n[123]It means I didn't do it. \n[124]I didn't. \n[125]I said I didn't do it. \n[126]I can't remember what I said. \n[127]  \n[128]What the fuck do you think!? \n[129]What? \n[130]Just fuck off, OK. \n[131]They took my fucking finger prints! \n[132]So what!? I can get into serious trouble. \n[133]Yeah, that's right! They don't take this shit lightly. \n[134]People could have been hurt! If someone was killed it would have been considered murder. \n[135]Please just leave me alone. \n[136]What? \n[137]No. 53. \n[138]What are doing here? \n[139]No, I'm not. \n[140]What?

I forgot. \n[172]Yeah, well, I told you I don't want to go. \n[173]I did. I told you I didn't want to go. I told you a hundred times. \n[174]Yes I did.

You gonna start punishing me now? \n[181]Shit, dad. I'm really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch. I'm sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months. \n[182] \n[183]What?! \n[184]Oh, what, soon as I'm right, that's enough?! \n[185]Fine. Fuck this. \n[186]Can I talk to you? \n[187]I need to talk to you. \n[188]I came to talk to him. \n[189]It's none of your business. \n[190]Just leave me alone. \n[191]I got the money. \n[192]The money for the car. \n[193]You said if I got eighteen hundred dollars I could have the car back. \n[194]What? What do you mean- \n[195]What are you talking about? \n[196]Where's it gone?! \n[197] \n[198]What's going on? \n[199]What!? \n[200]What do you mean? \n[201]Oh, Jesus. 83. \n[202]What happened? \n[203] \n[204] \n[205]   \n[206]Ah, hi. It's TJ here. I, ah, I'm sorry to bug you, but um, I don't know, I guess I wanted to talk to you right now. I don't know. I have a present for you too, so maybe I'll just come drop it off or something, or ah, yeah... Um, OK. Bye. \n[207]What are you doing? \n[208]It's starting to rain. \n[209]Fuck you. Fuck you fuck you fuck you. \n[210]Fuck you. And you're a fucking whore. I hope you die. And when you do, no one's gonna fuckin' notice.

I have to go. \n[248]I'm sorry I broke your lamp. 100. \n[249]And I'm sorry I called you a fat prostitute. \n[250]You're not fat. \n[251]I dunno. Maybe. \n[252]Sorry. 104. \n[253] \n[254]  \n[255]Come in. \n[256]Hey. Look at you. \n[257]I hardly recognize you. 110. \n[258]Gone where?

And that means it's his to sell if he wants. \n[6]Thanks, Bill. You got that work order there? \n[7]Get out of the car, son. \n[8]Dustin, get him outta there, will ya? \n[9]I'd get out of here kid, before he works himself loose. \n[10]Yes? \n[11]Oh, yeah? What about? \n[12]Yeah, I figured that. You made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and I thought I made it pretty clear that I couldn't give it to you. \n[13]The car's not for sale. \n[14]I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you. 34. \n[15]Look kid, I appreciate your enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't know what to tell you. You can't have the car. End of story. \n[16]Do you mind if I get back to it here? \n[17]Yeah, why don't you just have him send them over... Sure... Scott, can you hold on a minute? What do you want? \n[18]I'm on the phone here. Can you see that? \n[19]I'm on the phone. Wait outside. I'll be with you in a minute. \n[20]What? \n[21]What money? \n[22]What money for the car? \n[23]Are you kidding me? I said, 'even if you had eighteen hundred dollars, I still couldn't sell it to you.' Even if you had five million dollars, I couldn't sell it to you. It's not even here any more anyway, so that's it. \n[24]Kid. Leave me alone. I feel like I've had this conversation with you too many times already, but I can tell you we won't be having it again because the car's gone. \n[25]It's all over. It's gone. It's not here. 81. \n[26]Kid. It's over. Good bye. ", "Nicole": "\n[1]Leave him alone! \n[2]What are you doing?! \n[3]Are you alright? \n[4]I don't think so. Am I? \n[5]  \n[6]I can't believe he called me lady. Do I look like a lady to you? \n[7]Thanks. I mean do I look old? Well anyway, at least I can say I've been in a fight. 21. \n[8]I can't believe he called me lady. \n[9]Oh shit. \n[10]Ah, fuck it. \n[11]Hey, so I'm kinda like a hero now, aren't I? \n[12]Well actually, I basically just didn't want to have to go home and then spend the rest of the day feeling bad about the fact that I didn't help you and then hear about you on the news being beat to death in the parking lot. So you know, really I'm just - I did it for me. I'm just selfish. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry I'm like that. \n[13]Oh, gas station. 22. \n[14]Whoaaa... sorry, sorry. \n[15]  \n[16]Perfect landing. \n[17]You like black or red? \n[18]Black? Really? Are you sure? \n[19]\n[20]Red it is. \n[21]  \n[22]It's super sour isn't it? You don't have to eat it if you don't like it. \n[23]I know, that's the point. I used to hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't know what happened. I just recently acquired a taste for it. I don't even really know what's in it, but I pretty much eat it all the time. And I'm sure it's making me fat. I just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones? \n[24]I don't know why I'm telling you this. Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you loved these - \n[25]So you could eat 'em for me. But now I can see you don't like em' and I'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a way. \n[26]Hey! \n[27]You want your bike? 24. \n[28]Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey. \n[29]How's it goin'? \n[30]Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks. 35. \n[31]Oh, OK. \n[32]Thanks. \n[33]See ya. \n[34] Hi. \n[35]I'm sorry. I didn't - 57. \n[36]Sometimes, you know, a day is bad and then when you think it couldn't get any worse you suddenly discover whole new ways it can get worse. \n[37]No, thanks. 60. \n[38]Was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me? About how I should just step back and let things work themselves out? \n[39]What the hell was that? \n[40]What? \n[41] \n[42]Who's that guy? \n[43]We're where? \n[44]What was that back there? \n[45]That other house? \n[46]What the fuck!? \n[47]Yeah, and now I'm wet. \n[48]Cut it out. \n[49]So, how do you know this guy? \n[50]What, like he's renting a room or something? \n[51]Do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard? \n[52]Do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone? Do you think their gonna miss her? \n[53]Jesus Christ. \n[54]Did he just leave us? I think we should get out of here. \n[55]So, what's his name? \n[56]Hesher?... Is that a name? \n[57]Does he have a last name? \n[58]How old is he? \n[59]Do you know anything about him? \n[60]That was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car. I was freaking out. I don't really have any insurance right now. I just can't afford it. There's no way I could afford to fix that guy's car. How do people do this stuff? I mean, I have a job. It's kind of a joke though. I've been there for like a year and I'm still only doing like five hours a week. Why aren't they giving me any more hours? Do you think it's because they think I suck? Did you think I sucked when I served you at the checkout? \n[61]I don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon. 67. \n[62]The sad thing is I could actually use it. \n[63]Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a ticket... \n[64]Fuck, fuck, fuck it. \n[65]Ah, shit. Fuck it. \n[66]What have I done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? Sometimes I wonder if I were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice. \n[67]That's nice of you to say, but I doubt it. \n[68]Please don't call me lady. \n[69]Let's get out of here. \n[70]You wanna steer or push? \n[71]Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. \n[72]     \n[73]     \n[74]Oh shit. TJ. \n[75]   \n[76]I came to see you. 99. \n[77]I wanted to tell you something. \n[78]I didn't know if I should come here or not, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I thought maybe if I came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then I thought if I didn't you'd think I didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I might as well come, just in case, so here I am. \n[79]I want to apologize. I feel bad about what happened. I didn't take your feelings into consideration - \n[80]Yes it does. It does to me. I like you, TJ. We're friends. \n[81]I understand if you don't want to be my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't know.
