Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being. \n[19]Yes you do... \n[20]No, you don't, Jim. 'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.

Small freighters.  We've done containers... \n[68]What kind of weight? \n[69]What you get from us is a date.  A place.  \"In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami.\"  At such-and-such time, an eighteen-\t wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick\t it up.  And you drive it... ...away. \n[70]And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move? \n[71]What happened to the last transporter you had? \n[72] \n[73]Then what were we talking to you for? \n[74]What do I care what you think about how he looks?

So let's go... \n[124]Heads up... \n[125]That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's worth more than the real estate. But no one's supposed to notice his drive-by? \n[126]  \n[127]\n[128]This the load you lost a while back? \n[129] \n[130]You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again... \n[131] \n[132]And as an investment in the future... \n[133]It's yours cause what's yours, is yours.  And what's ours is ours... ...like the second ten-percent, which is now due, Yero, my ace. \n[134]What's up next?  Or is this a one- time deal? \n[135]Conveyance? \n[136] \n[137]Can I talk to you for a second, partner...? \n[138] \n[139]...secure satellite comms. encrypted e-mail, the longs and lats for the transshipment point...all that?  It's all cool. But I need a vector, not a location.  'Cause ships move. That's why they call them ships. Ship stops?  It's trying to be an apartment building.  At sea that attracts attention.  That's bad... \n[140]Where the hell are you, man? \n[141]  \n[142] \n[143]Where'd you go? \n[144]Where? \n[145]Verdado where? \n[146]Havana, Cuba...? \n[147]...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya? \n[148]You're not makin' a move on her...? \n[149]Oh, that makes it okay, then. \n[150]His operations are kingpin size and first-class.  His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis. Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming capability... \n[151]And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you? \n[152]Their loads are poly-drug.  \"E\" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan \"H.\" Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network. \n[153]So we want to change-up the mission statement. \n[154]He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization... \n[155]Chill out Sonny. \n[156]With Sonny.  110%. \n[157]  \n[158] \n[159]There is \"undercover.\"  And there is \"Which way is up?\" \n[160]I am asking.  You to me. \n[161]I would never doubt you. \n[162]And do you doubt I will slot anyone complicit in the death of Maria, Alonzo and those children? Anyone...whoever they are... \n[163]   \n[164]  \n[165]Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... \n[166]At ten to three on the 27th, I will satellite page him with a website and encryption code.  He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading.  Ten minutes and thirty seconds, website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland... \n[167]Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki... \n[168]And Jos\u00e9, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea. So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...? \n[169]\n[170]What's the point?  It's going down. \n[171] \n[172]Yeah.  Whatever... \n[173] \n[174]Meaning...? \n[175]They'll kill Gina. \n[176]  \n[177] \n[178]They're proving it's right now. And that she's alive right now... \n[179]  \n[180]Smell.  Bad smell.

As in \"free, gratis.\" \n[146]A fine...business...relationship... \n[147] \n[148]Let me buy you a drink. \n[149] \n[150]It goes very fast. \n[151] \n[152]     \n[153] \n[154]Where's that? \n[155]The Keys? \n[156]Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business... \n[157]  \n[158]  \n[159]Light touch.  Everything comes to you through the wheel. \n[160]  \n[161]How do we get into Cuba?! \n[162]You do business in Cuba with your husband? \n[163]Were you born in Havana? \n[164]Where's she now? \n[165]Your father? \n[166]How's he not your husband? \n[167]   \n[168]  \n[169] \n[170]I dance... \n[171]   \n[172]   \n[173]  \n[174]  \n[175]  \n[176]  \n[177]  \n[178]No. \n[179]  \n[180]  \n[181]Died in childbirth, having me... \n[182]You know how improbable this is...? \n[183]...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow. \n[184]...and therafore there is no consequence? \n[185]  \n[186] \n[187]...and a different kind of deal. \n[188]Like \"three thousand a ki?\"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers. \n[189]Cost less.  That's the point. \n[190]What do you mean? \n[191]Better than that. We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  \"And why,\" you're thinking, \"would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?\"  And the answer is, \"of course\" but also \"no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can.\" \n[192]Zero risk. \n[193]'Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free. \n[194]Then I would say to you, this has been fun... \n[195]I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... \n[196]Twenty-eight-point-five. \n[197]I would say you're... ...four percentage points away from a deal... \n[198]We'll do it at twenty-two... \n[199]...and now what? \n[200]  \n[201] \n[202]  \n[203]  \n[204]Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place. \n[205]Verdado. \n[206]It's in the suburbs outside Havana. \n[207]No.  Havana, Louisiana. Don't we have a meet? \n[208]No. \n[209]We're makin' moves on each other. \n[210] \n[211]Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade. \n[212]Yeah.  CIA-level stuff... \n[213]Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow... \n[214]Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe. \n[215]And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out. \n[216]Keys to the boat.  Go do this motherfucker yourself. \n[217] \n[218]We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC... \n[219]I'm my own man.  And anytime you\t want to see how much man I am? \n[220]  \n[221]As in...? \n[222]You think I am in so deep I forgot? \n[223]Do you believe...I have forgotten I am a cop? \n[224]No, I do not. \n[225]  \n[226]Hola, chica. \n[227]  \n[228]Now how we do it, blood.  It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing. \n[229]Packaging? \n[230]If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy... \n[231]\n[232]And the chopsticks and fortune cookies? \n[233]They're all the same.  \"Financial security is around the corner.\" \"Your friends love you.\" \n[234]Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts? \n[235]...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance. \n[236] \n[237]Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them. So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run... \n[238]Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can. \n[239]Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner. \n[240]Of course. \n[241]Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there... \n[242] \n[243]A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you. \n[244]...in the morning. \n[245]   \n[246]Go ahead. \n[247]Switek? \n[248]What's your take? \n[249]Call the US Coast Guard:  \"Come and arrest our ass.\" And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine... \n[250]Then you should. \n[251]  \n[252]Yeah? \n[253] \n[254]What friend? \n[255]Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive? \n[256]Yero doesn't know she's here! \n[257]Yero, by himself? \n[258]Dump the rest.  Let's get the boats up that river. \n[259]  \n[260]Jos\u00e9 Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina. \n[261]They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment... \n[262]It's a rip and a hit. \n[263]You can't. \n[264]Supposedly it's coming. \n[265]  \n[266]Just came in.  She's still alive. \n[267] \n[268] \n[269]\n[270]\n[271]\n[272] \n[273]  \n[274]  \n[275]  \n[276]Isabella!! \n[277]  \n[278]  \n[279]  \n[280]  \n[281]   \n[282]  \n[283]  \n[284]  \n[285]  \n[286] \n[287]Touch the windshield with your hands.  Let 'em see your hands are empty.  Steady. \n[288]Yeah.  Hey, Robert. \n[289]Yeah.  Going to Miami General. Check out Gina.  Everybody's okay. Everybody's fine... \n[290]  \n[291]Isabella...? \n[292]No. \n[293]  \n[294]No part of it wasn't real. \n[295]It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you. Just like I said. And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will. \n[296]Luck ran out. This was too good to last. \n[297]     ", "Alonzo": "\n[1]  \n[2]  \n[3]   \n[4]  \n[5]  \n[6]  ", "Stevens": "\n[1]  \n[2]Sonny...? \n[3]Where's Riccardo? \n[4]I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny... \n[5]  \n[6] \n[7]They had me from the gate. \n[8]I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em. \n[9]After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know... \n[10]...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay? Look what I did to them, Sonny...! \n[11]Goodbye. \n[12]   \n[13]The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types... \n[14] \n[15]How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.

Too many moving parts. \n[14]If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one... \n[15] \n[16]  \n[17]They grabbed Gina... \n[18]Gina.  Like Alonzo's wife...
