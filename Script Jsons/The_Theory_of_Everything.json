Inexplicable. \n[65]My chances are probably - - well, some \"integer of zero\", but I think we can make a go of this. I want us to be together, for as long as we've got.

So God must die. \n[113]The two great pillars of physics \n[114]...Einstein's theory. Which governs the very large, planets and such--but Quantum - \n[115]They don't remotely play by the same rules. Peas are chaotic, and don't behave predictably at all - \n[116]Which you can set your watch by. \n[117]If the world were all potatoes, easy--you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did, a moment of Creation. Hallelujah, God lives. \n[118]But if you want to incorporate peas into the menu, which Stephen now wants to do, then it all goes \n[119]Tits up. Haywire. Becomes a Godless mess. \n[120]Einstein hated peas, Quantum Theory. \"God doesn't play dice with the universe\", he said. \n[121]Seems he not only plays dice - \n[122]- he throws them - \n[123]Stephen's swapped his telescope - for a microscope. Order for chaos--hoping to find a law to cover both. \n[124]God is back on the endangered species list. \n[125]Physics is back in business.

Cheers! \n[60]So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it? \n[61]Ouch. \n[62]A smashing time actually. Spacetime was born. \n[63]Space and Time finally got together. People always thought they were too dissimilar, couldn't possibly work out. But then along comes Einstein, the ultimate match- maker, and decided that space and time, not only had a future, but had been married all along. \n[64]Well that's astonishing, isn't it? \n[65]Would you dance with me? \n[66] \n[67]If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe? \n[68]If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? - \n[69]- which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... \n[70]What are you doing? \n[71] \n[72]Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... \n[73] \n[74]A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time. \n[75]The universe born from a black hole exploding. \n[76]Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began? \n[77]I don't know how. \n[78]What is it? What's wrong with me? \n[79]What's that? \n[80]Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--? \n[81]Wait! What about--what about the brain? \n[82]What? \n[83]    \n[84]I have a disease, Bri. \n[85]No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player. \n[86]  \n[87]Will you leave me Brian? \n[88]  \n[89] \n[90]THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   31 \n[91]   \n[92] \n[93]John is having an affair with Martha. But Martha is in love with Alan. And I think Alan is homosexual by the look of his shirts. I'm trying to work out the mathematical probability of happiness. \n[94]It's some integer of zero, but I'm not there yet. \n[95] \n[96]You just missed him. He was here earlier. \n[97]What? \n[98]Go. \n[99]I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it...\"a slough of despond.\" \n[100]My turn. \n[101]  \n[102]Go away. \n[103] \n[104]Go away! \n[105]There's nothing to say-- just... \n[106]That's what I want. I haven't got time for you. So - if you care about me at all - go. \n[107]I've got two years. I need to work. \n[108]You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion... \n[109]You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything. \n[110] \n[111] \n[112]Time. \n[113] \n[114] \n[115]No thankyou. \n[116]Thankyou. \n[117]Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything? \n[118]I'm sorry. \n[119]It's okay Robert. \n[120]This--is--temporary. \n[121]Well, it's convenient for breakfast! \n[122]Thank you. \n[123]I said--thankyou. \n[124]Go Jane. \n[125]\n[126] \n[127] \n[128]In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So... \n[129]- it must eventually disappear. \n[130]First a star vanishes into a black hole, but then the black hole must itself--vanish. \n[131]Was it something I said? \n[132]Big legs! Big legs Brian! \n[133]What? \n[134]Different system. Automatic. \n[135]No doctors! \n[136](forcefully, but with a \n[137] \n[138] \n[139]Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win! \n[140](testily, his slurring \n[141]My new project - disproves it. \n[142]What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics. \n[143]No. Mine. \n[144] \n[145] \n[146]Tits up. \n[147]Seems he not only plays dice - \n[148]- he throws them - where we can't find them. \n[149]But physics--is back in business. \n[150] \n[151]More wine? \n[152]Wrong guy to ask. \n[153]I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me. \n[154]We have help. \n[155] \n[156]For black holes--not rock concerts. \n[157]I've just been invited - \n[158]Geneva. \n[159]Students can accompany me. \n[160]I know how much you hate - \n[161]- to fly. \n[162]I was thinking - that you and the \n[163]could bring the car - \n[164]- meet me in Bayreuth - \n[165]Bring Jonathan. \n[166] \n[167]Is--this okay? \n[168]Jane--needs--help. \n[169] \n[170]   \n[171](electronic voice, \n[172]Daisy. Daisy. Give Me Your Answer Do. \n[173]Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn. \n[174]Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! \n[175]I will write. A Book. \n[176]Time... \n[177]What is the nature of Time? \n[178]Will it ever come to an end? \n[179]Can we go back in time? \n[180]Some day these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun, or perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. \n[181]Only Time, whatever that may be, will tell. \n[182]It is for a friend. \n[183]So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe. I finally found her. \n[184]Yes. Of course. \n[185]\n[186]You - are - welcome. \n[187]E-laine has offered to travel with me to A-merica. She will look after me. \n[188]Don't worry. \n[189] \n[190]Everything will be okay. \n[191]How many years? \n[192]Be. Happy. \n[193]I cannot sign copies of my book-- but if you like--I could drive over it. \n[194]Can you hear me? There are some things I cannot do. But. They are mostly the things I don't particularly want to do anyway. \n[195]I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking. \n[196]He believed me. \n[197]I now predict -- that I was wrong. \n[198]I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came. \n[199]It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies... \n[200]...but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope. \n[201]\n[202]   "}}
