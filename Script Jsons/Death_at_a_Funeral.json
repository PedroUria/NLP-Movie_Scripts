Do they know where he is? \n[2] \n[3] \n[4]Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned. They all freeze. There's a long silence. ", "Reverend": "\n[1]Aaron, how are you? 25. \n[2]Yes, I have two more funerals and a Christening. I don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan. \n[3]Ah, the writer, of course. I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I'm reading \"Mama's Secret\" right now. Don't tell anybody, I'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff. \n[4]   \n[5]Oh. I thought... \n[6]Great... Well, I'll just make sure have everything I need. 26. \n[7]We've got a body and a Bible. Well, I'm all set. She walks off. \n[8]I think we should get started. really have to leave at three. \n[9].Of course. \n[10]Ladies and gentlemen, could you all kindly take your seats? We're about to begin the service. Ryan helps Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar. Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell to his place. \n[11]Family and friends, we're gathered here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes. \n[12]I'd like to start with a favorite passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King James Bible. \"And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house...\" While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the shoulder and leans forward. \n[13].\"Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul...\" As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried. The woman sitting next to him smacks his wrist down. ANGLE ON: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar. Oscar is fidgeting and looking worried. ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried. \n[14].\"And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle.\" ANGLE ON: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control him. \n[15]And now we'll have a few words from Edward's son, Aaron. Ryan's older brother. ANGLE ON: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle gives Aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees Frank staring at him. ANGLE ON: Uncle Russell. \n[16]Are you alright? \n[17]Ah! I think we're just about ready to start the service, so- \n[18]  \n[19]Lookie here, brother. I've been patient. We all know it's a virtue, but I'm about done with patience. Now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation. \n[20]Five minutes. \n[21]Look, I'm sorry, I really need to use \n[22]I'm not a priest. \n[23]  \n[24]Look, I must get to a phone. There's a man on the roof who's going to jump. \n[25]We're going to have to fly through this now. I already missed a funeral and two Christenings. \n[26]Do you want an open casket? \n[27]Alright! Everybody in their seats now!  Hey, you, sit down. People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her. \n[28] I'd like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions. I hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service. Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say a few words about his father. Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front. Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath. ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up. ANGLE ON: Aaron. ", "Victor": "", "Mourner": "\n[1]There's someone in there! ", "Jane": "", "Peter": "", "Justin": "", "Simon": "", "Uncle": "\n[1]Where the fuck have you been, you fat bastard? You're late. If you took any longer I'd be dead, too. The fake smile falls off Norman's face. \n[2]What's happening? \n[3]I said what's happening? Are we there?. Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell. \n[4]What the hell is going on? Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane. \n[5]You're going the wrong way! \n[6]What's going on here? Where are we?! We're going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane. \n[7]What are you doing?! Be careful with that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently. \n[8]Hurry up, we're late. Norman slams the trunk closed. \n[9]Come on, put your back into it. You're supposed to be a young man. Don't you have any strength? \n[10]Terrible. Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath. \n[11]Move! Move! He pokes people with his cane. Aaron then takes his seat with Michelle. Oscar is not looking so good. Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his seat. Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating, pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of everyone. Norman takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans away. \n[12]Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? This is bullshit. 42. \n[13]It wouldn't have happened if Ryan had done the eulogy. Aaron exits through the garden door. \n[14]I read your last book, \"Black Hurt.\" \n[15]I'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell. \n[16]Don't worry. The way you look, you won't be far behind. The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the floor. 67. \n[17]No, my nephew is dead and these bastards ate all the potato salad. Nearby mourners look appalled. The reverend looks over and sees Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor. She approaches them. \n[18]What's your problem?! \n[19]No such thing as having a woman without a problem. If they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em? Let me tell you something about women. Smarter than you think they are. But not as smart as they think they are. \n[20]  \n[21]Listen here, boy. This is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her-- 84. \n[22]Has not hitting her worked? Look, then you grab her and kiss her. The harder the better. \n[23]Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the can? He rolls away quickly. \n[24]Hello?! Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures. Finally Jeff relents. \n[25]I need the toilet. Jeff and Norman both look panicked. Norman goes to the door. 85. \n[26]I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How am I supposed to get up the stairs?! \n[27]Open the damn door! Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane. \n[28]What the hell is wrong with you people? I'm about to take a dump in my pants! \n[29]Hurry up! Norman is struggling to hold Uncle Russell up. \n[30]Have you got me? \n[31]Come on, quick, quick, quick. \n[32]Pants down. Pants down. \n[33]How can I do it? I'm handicapped. Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down. \n[34]Drawers. Drawers. Take down my drawers. \n[35]Am I there? Am I there? Norman looks and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet. 90. \n[36]Ooh, that's better. Norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock. ANGLE ON: Norman's hand has shit on the fingers. He starts freaking out and screaming. \n[37]What's that? Aaron slams the door. We can hear Russell's muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom door. \n[38]What the hell is going on in this place? \n[39]Never mind that. What about that dead body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance. \n[40]Don't mess with me. I know a dead body when I see one. I live in a retirement home. 112. \n[41]I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was dead! \n[42]No! In the bathroom. Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to. ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron. \n[43]I always thought he had a little sugar in his tank. Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally shouts across the room.
