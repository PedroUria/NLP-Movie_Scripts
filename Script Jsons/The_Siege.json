It just blew. \n[8] \n[9]-- That's what they're telling me. \n[10]Maybe it's performance art. \n[11]-- available from The Sharper Image catalogue. \n[12]Jihad isn't known for their sense of humor, and Hamas is raising so much money here, why queer their deal? \n[13]-- And, excuse me, but why do we immediately assume they're Arabs? \n[14]Hub... I think we're all eager to give up our weekends on this. It just occurs to me, has anybody even committed a crime here? I mean, assault with a deadly color? \n[15]-- Omar Abdel Rahman... asshole. \n[16]Under protest. \n[17] \n[18]-- big orthodontia bills. Someday, you'll understand. \n[19]Where we going? \n[20]You sleep here? Immigration called. \n[21]-- who's trying to score points with his boss, bigtime. \n[22] \n[23]...He means, \"dowry.\" \n[24]The tabac. Sssssss... The territories. \n[25]A '97 Contour. On my Visa. Back home, the security services'd be up this guy's ass with a poker, but what do we do, we let him go. \n[26]Not my first date, Hub. He's taking the BQE. Looks like it's Brooklyn. \n[27]You're micro-managing. \n[28]I get reimbursed for this, right? \n[29] \n[30] \n[31]Don't know him. If we were allowed to get sound on them, we'd know him. \n[32]He's making him. Shit. Fuck. He's -- \n[33]Christ! \n[34]Shit --! I didn't take the insurance. \n[35]It's not his dog, numbnuts. They're spies. \n[36]Hi, guys, I expect you know the drill. \n[37]So, Elise... You okay back there, you don't get carsick or anything? Those handcuffs too tight --? \n[38]Wow. You're really good. She's really good. \n[39] \n[40]The driver's name is Larry Kaiser. He says they've got explosives strapped to their chests, they got automatic weapons, and they're speaking Arabic. \n[41]Tunnel's got twenty minute delays and they're working on both bridges. \n[42]Meaning? \n[43]-- Hub... \n[44]-- So? \n[45]I don't know if they understand. \n[46]The guy's just breathing into the phone, maybe they're not even Arabs. \n[47]Okay, here we go... \n[48] \n[49]  \n[50]Shut the fuck up and go give somebody a parking ticket. \n[51]IAP66. What's IAP66? \n[52]-- Today, Danny... \n[53]Which is... vaporized. \n[54]At the point of issuance. Could be the American Consulate in Tel Aviv. The American Consulate in Amman, Cairo, Alexandria, Riyadh -- all an easy drive from the West Bank -- \n[55]Sorry, boss. Hello, Elise. Mmmm, is that pastrami? Oh, yeah, we made the guy in the picture. \n[56]My people. The last of the unambivalent smokers. Monsters. The toughest motherfucker in Bed-Stuy is a muffin compared to some of these guys. \n[57]His name's Samir Nazhde. Teaches Arab Studies at Brooklyn College. He sponsored Ail Waziri's student visa. And dig this -- his brother blew up a movie theatre in Tel Aviv. \n[58] \n[59]Yes, and he's on the next plane for Tunis. \n[60] \n[61]Samir Nazhde, my name is Frank Haddad, I'm a Federal Agent. We have reason to believe you are an accessory to the bombing of Bus 87. \n[62]You are an associate of Ali Waziri. \n[63]You got him a student visa. \n[64]You spent two years in Israeli jails during the Intifada. \n[65]Sorry. Family matter. You're going downtown, my friend. \n[66]Defrauding the INS is a Federal Offense. Reservation for one, please. \n[67]  \n[68]-- Someday I will tell you what those people did to my village in '71. \n[69]What's there to tip? \n[70]So you're saying... you sleep around? \n[71]I'll have somebody drive you. \n[72]Elise. I'm really high strung, too. \n[73]Beats cable. \n[74]-- You're telling me that just because some Brooklyn landlord tips you off that he's been paid in cash, you have the right to call in the cavalry -- ! Hub, as far as I know, paying cash is not yet a crime in this country. \n[75]-- You've observed him giving cash to -- \n[76]-- But you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus 87 --? \n[77]And when you do, you'll get your warrant. \n[78]Meaning? \n[79]Tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering? \n[80]Not good enough. \n[81]Waves mean nothing to me; there's been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years, but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure I'd send you packing. There's a price to be paid for living in a free society -- \n[82]Three sounds right. If we had microwave we'd know for sure. The CIA's got microwave, how come we don't have microwave. \n[83]Drop your weapon! \n[84]Anybody like anchovies --? \n[85]What --? \n[86]So am I --! Hey, Elise... tell us about being a spook?

The other's a doctor. They check out clean. \n[95]A clean body and a pure heart. \n[96]-- If you're on the State Department Terrorist Watch list you cannot get into this country. But Ali Waziri was on the watch list, and he got in. \n[97]They told me to call INS. \n[98]They told me to call State. \n[99]What the fuck is the NYPD doing here?! \n[100]\n[101]They got Frankie.

Besides, this is where I belong. Here. I'm not their sand nigger anymore. \n[106] \n[107] \n[108]He's alright. Thanks for getting him out. \n[109]I trust her about as far as I can throw her. \n[110]Ah, microwave. \n[111]We've got a problem. \n[112]  \n[113]What the -- \n[114]She knew we were listening. \n[115]  \n[116] \n[117]Allah Ahkbar -- \n[118] ", "Haddad": "\n[1]  ", "Muezzin": "\n[1]Allahuh Akbar...

For my brother, it was already like dying. The only thing he lives for is movies. \n[12]-- And then some sheik tells him that, to die for Allah is beautiful. If he does this thing, our parents will be taken care of, and he will live on in Paradise with seventy virgins. Seventy.
