You've got her wrong. She's a good girl. \n[103]Mum! \n[104]The cops came by my club today. \n[105]They're investigating a murder.

All my life I've been running... \n[112]- his name is Chang- \n[113]Mum, don't talk to her like that. \n[114]Me. \n[115]Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it. \n[116]Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me-- \n[117]-- So you sent him to me and what could I do? \n[118]I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did. \n[119]And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me. \n[120]I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. \n[121]I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... \n[122]Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling. \n[123]It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs. \n[124]That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... \n[125]...that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient. \n[126]Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed. \n[127]I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why? \n[128]'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him. \n[129]I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you. \n[130]I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... \n[131]You never did, Mum. \n[132]I'm fine. \n[133]I'll be fine. In a minute. \n[134]Sorry about that. \n[135]Seeing when it hurts. \n[136]Didn't you like what I got you? \n[137]What do you mean? \n[138]Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy. \n[139]Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me. \n[140]Don't go there. \n[141]You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. \n[142]How much do I owe you? \n[143]Come on. \n[144]What are you talking about? \n[145]Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest. \n[146]Yeah, well I lost. \n[147]... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all. \n[148]Nothing. I don't feel anything at all. \n[149]What do you want, Mum? \n[150]What's wrong Mum? \n[151]What's wrong? \n[152]Who does? \n[153]Chang? \n[154]What did you do, Mum? What did you do? \n[155]We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out... \n[156]We're outside. \n[157]I need you here.

Didn't want to leave... \n[173]... without saying goodbye. \n[174]My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me. \n[175]I got about twelve grand at the club...
