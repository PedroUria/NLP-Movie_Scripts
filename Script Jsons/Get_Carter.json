It's going to be a restaurant. Do you like it? \n[27]Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back, You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother, One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, So I'm worried. I can't fight them \u0097 I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead. \n[28]Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you. \n[29]Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it. \n[30]I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead. \n[31]I don't know. That's all I was told. \n[32]Christ, what... \n[33]Jack, you're wrong. \n[34]Jack... \n[35]  \n[36]I don't want them cooking in here.

What is it, Jack? \n[3] \n[4]Eric told me of your bereavement. \n[5]Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places! \n[6]If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better. \n[7]Nasty way to go. \n[8]Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.
