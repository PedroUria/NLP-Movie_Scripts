This magical woman who has only lived in your head, you'll be able to meet her, speak to her, hear her sing. \n[32]  \n[33]No? \n[34]Oh yes she does! \n[35]In your books! \n[36]Tell ya what. You just listen to what my Sherman boys have come up with and if they don't knock your socks off then I'm the King of England. \n[37]Bet you would. \n[38]Greensleeves huh? \n[39]Greensleeves. \n[40]Pam, I want you to know that the last thing I would do, the very last thing, is tarnish a story I have cherished. \n[41] The pages are worn down to tissue, dog eared and falling out. I have poured over them gripped, tormented. Because I love Mary Poppins, you got to share her with me. \n[42]A course nothing happens without your say so. Absolutely Nothing. \n[43]It's all in the rights agreement. As approved by your agent, Dermot. \n[44]Darmitt. \n[45]Live action. \n[46]Hm? \n[47]Tape you say. \n[48]I understand. I do. \n[49]Let's make something wonderful. \n[50]    \n[51]Okay that'll work. \n[52]I asked for that. \n[53]Because I asked for it. \n[54]Tommie! \n[55]What do you think? \n[56]You're a woman. \n[57]What am I missing? \n[58]   \n[59]May I walk with you? \n[60]Forget ironic, it's iconic. \n[61]I won't be able to stop singing that for weeks! \n[62]What's your point Pam? \n[63]No whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children. \n[64]That'll work. \n[65]She's going to say no isn't she? Woman's a conundrum. \n[66]Inspired by someone we know? \n[67]She won't. \n[68]I do. I know it, I know it only too well. I've fought this battle from her side. Pat Powers, he wanted the mouse and I didn't have a bean back then. \n[69]He was this big terrifying New York producer and I was just a kid from Missouri with a sketch of Mickey but-- it woulda' killed me to give him up. \n[70]Honest to god killed me. That mouse, he's family. Go home. \n[71] Pam! \n[72]Callin' to check up on you. \n[73]Hm? \n[74]Pam, are you always so battle ready? P.L. Travers in her breast plate and chain mail, sword up in the air and off with your head! \n[75]Please, I beg of you, please please call me Walt. \n[76]I heard things didn't go so well today. \n[77]What's this all about Pam? Really? \n[78]I'm wondering what I have to do to make you happy. \n[79]Aren't you wondering that too? \n[80] You know, you've never been to Disneyland! It's the happiest place on Earth! (shouting away from the \n[81]Oh come on! When does anybody get to go to Disneyland with Walt Disney himself?! \n[82]I'm not a violent man Tommie but if Mrs P.L. Travers were to get hit by a large truck I-- (he doesn't allow himself \n[83]Okay boys. We gotta fix this. \n[84]Welcome to the Magic Kingdom! \n[85]Yup! Isn't it wonderful? \n[86]Pretty much! \n[87]War ain't over yet Pam! \n[88]   \n[89]In Adventureland there is a tree-- this is a fun fact. A titbit. \n[90]  \n[91]And they said only God could make a tree! \n[92]Where did she come from? \n[93]I think you know who. \n[94]Through the window huh? \n[95]It's just that easy isn't it Mrs Travers? \n[96]I know you don't wanna be here so I'm gonna take you to one ride-- my favourite amusement and then I'll set you free. \n[97]Mrs Travers, I would be honoured if you would ride Jingles. She's Mrs Disney's favourite horse. \n[98]No greater joy than that seen through the eyes of a child. \n[99]There's a child in us all. \n[100]Get on the horse Pamela! \n[101]When we first met, you said to me `they're family.' \n[102]Mary Poppins, the Banks's, they're family. The boys have had an idea for your Mister Banks. I think it'll make you happy. \n[103]No. I brought you all the way out here for monetary gain. Had a wager with the boys that I couldn't get you on a ride. I win! \n[104]Yah! \n[105]  \n[106]Don't worry Tommie, please close the door. \n[107]Never let anybody see me smoking. I'd hate to encourage bad habits. Please, sit down. \n[108] \n[109]Mrs Travers, what in the world has upset you so? \n[110]It's a sequence-- \n[111]And it isn't! \n[112]No they're animated. \n[113]Pam! Pamela! Mrs Travers! Wait! \n[114]Please Mrs Travers-- You must listen. \n[115]Pamela? I don't understand why this is so hard for you. Please, make me \n[116]The promise breakers? Mrs Travers I- \n[117]Mrs Travers? \n[118]Hi. \n[119] \n[120]You must reconsider. You must. \n[121]He's? \n[122]She's gone? \n[123](expecting to read her \n[124]Then who's Travers? \n[125] I've been talking to the wrong person. \n[126]It was one heck of a job getting a seat on the very next flight, let me tell you. \n[127]How about you show me how to make one of those nice English pots of tea? \n[128]I remember. \n[129]   \n[130]No, I've come because you misjudge me. \n[131]You look at me and you see some kind of Hollywood King Midas. \n[132]You think I've built an empire and that I want to use your Mary Poppins as just another brick in my kingdom. You think I see her with a carpetbag full of greenbacks. \n[133]If that was all it was would I have pursued an cranky, stubborn dame like you for twenty years? I'd've have saved myself an ulcer! No, you expected me to disappoint you and so you made sure I did. You see, I think life disappoints you, Mrs Travers. I think it's done that a lot. Maybe Mary Poppins is the only person in your life who hasn't. \n[134]Oh, no, that's not true. She's real as can be to my daughter's and to thousands of other children-- adults too. She's been there as a nighttime comfort to a heck of a lot of people. \n[135]Mrs Travers, I am so sorry. I hoped this would be a magical experience for you, for all of us. But I let you down-- and in doing so, I've broken a twenty year old promise to my girls. I've been wracking my brains, trying to figure out why this has been so hard for you and I-- You see, I have my own Mr Banks. Mine had a moustache. \n[136]But it is true that you created yourself in someone else's yes? \n[137]Ever been to Kansas City, Mrs Travers? Do you know Missouri at all? \n[138]It's mighty cold there in the winters. Bitter. \n[139] My dad, Elias Disney, he owned a newspaper delivery route there. Thousand papers. Twice daily. Morning and evening edition. Elias, he was a tough businessman. A save- a-penny anywhere you can type of fella so he wouldn't employ any delivery boys, he just used me and my big brother Roy. I was eight then-- eight years old. Like I said, those winters were harsh and old Elias didn't believe in new shoes until the old ones were worn right through so-- Honestly, Mrs Travers, the snow would be up to here-- \n[140]You'd push through it like wading through molasses. \n[141]And the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces-- and sometimes I'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz I must've passed out for a moment-- I dunno. Then school, too cold to figure out an equation. And back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. My mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition. Best be quick Walt, best be quick or poppa's gonna show you the buckle end again boy. \n[142]Now, I don't tell you all this to make you sad Mrs Travers, I don't. I love my life - it's a miracle. And I loved my daddy, boy I loved him. But, there isn't a day goes by where I don't think of that little boy in the snow and old Elias with his fist and strap and I'm just so tired-- I'm tired of remembering it that way. Aren't you tired Mrs Travers? We all have our tales but don't you want to find a way to finish the story? Let it all go and have a life that isn't dictated by a past? It's not the children she comes to save. It's their father. It's your father--? Travers Goff. \n[143]You must've loved and admired him a lot to take his name-- \n[144]Mrs. Travers. It's all about him isn't it? All of this. Everything. \n[145]Forgiveness. It's what I learned from your books. \n[146]No, you need to forgive Helen Goff. Life is a harsh sentence to lay down for yourself. \n[147]Give her to me, Mrs Travers. Trust me with your precious Mary Poppins. I won't disappoint you. I swear that every time a person goes into a movie house - from Leicester to St Louis, they will see George Banks being saved. They will love him and his kids, they will weep for his cares, and wring their hands when he loses his job. And when he flies that kite, oh! They will rejoice, they will sing. In every movie house, all over the world, in the eyes and the hearts of my kids, and other kids and their mothers and fathers for generations to come, George Banks will be honoured. George Banks will be redeemed. George Banks and all he stands for will be saved. Maybe not in life, but in imagination. Because that's what we storytellers do. We restore order with imagination. We instill hope again and again and again. Trust me, Mrs Travers. Let me prove it to you. I give you my word. \n[148]Is that everyone? \n[149]  \n[150]There'll be cameras, press, interviews-- I have to protect the picture. \n[151]Morning Dolly. \n[152]What? \n[153]Mrs Travers! How wonderful to see you. What brings you to-- \n[154]Great! \n[155]I'll have a-- uh, replacement sent to your hotel right away. \n[156]Pam, how could I? \n[157]It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's alright. Mr Banks is going to be all right. I promise. ", "Disney": "\n[1]  \n[2]  \n[3]  \n[4]  \n[5]  \n[6]  \n[7]  \n[8]Hit me with it. \n[9]Ya? What kind of ideas? \n[10]And just how does she `see' things? \n[11]Gahd! Anything else? \n[12]We can't make the film without the colour red! It's set in London for pete's sake. \n[13]There's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms-- heck! The British flag! Pamela, I'm not sure why \n[14]Is this a test Pam? Are you requiring proof of how badly I wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together? \n[15]Alright. No red in the film. \n[16]   \n[17]  \n[18]Pamela sits on a bench, her feet tucked together, her arms clasped around her body, her face to the sky.
