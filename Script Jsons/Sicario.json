Early. \n[10]Gonna go see Guillermo. \n[11]That's the one. \n[12]Our objective is to dramatically overreact. \n[13]He's a little green. You've been kicking doors longer. \n[14]Makes you feel better to have him around, he can tag along after we get back from El Paso. \n[15]The men who are REALLY responsible. \n[16]We'll get to that... \n[17]Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport. \n[18]To keep my promise. \n[19]Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose. \n[20]Kate. \n[21]This way. \n[22]No. We just landed. \n[23]This is my bird dog, his name's Alejandro. \n[24]Yeah, we'll talk about it on the plane. \n[25]Yeah. \n[26]You guys don't have one? \n[27]They got some bitchin peanuts in the back. Kind of a self-serve deal though. \n[28]Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi. \n[29]I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out. \n[30]Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today? \n[31]I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'. \n[32]Where's everybody linking up? \n[33]Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad. \n[34]Man, I love Texans. \n[35]Sure, we'll take the tour. Loan me a couple of pop guns? \n[36]I will be by the time we get there. \n[37]I miss your hospitality, Keith. \n[38]Guess we're going sightseeing. \n[39]See if this fits. \n[40]Try it on. \n[41]He's a DOD advisor, just like me. \n[42]Pay attention to Alejandro -- he says do something, do it. \n[43]Fine. Stay here. \n[44]But you don't want to, do you? \n[45]You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start. \n[46]Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh? \n[47]Hey. I told you to stay here... \n[48]Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in... \n[49]On that note, I think you better stay out here. \n[50]Giving him a belly full of water... you devil. \n[51]Didn't think we'd get you here, did you? \n[52]I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him. \n[53]Alejandro, he remembers you. \n[54]Can they get them all in one place? No... I'm on a clock now, I can't wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center. How far is Tuscon? \n[55]We'll be there a little after 2. \n[56]You gotta learn how to sleep on a plane. \n[57]Has nothing to do with your race. I just don't believe you're good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate's sure fond of you, though. \n[58]We'll be quick. \n[59]You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call. \n[60]First I've heard it. \n[61]Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid. \n[62]All yours. \n[63]This feels very serious. \n[64]Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did. \n[65]What would you like to know? \n[66]Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better? \n[67]I'm going back in. \n[68]Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something. \n[69]We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss. \n[70]And then we know where his boss is. \n[71]It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow. \n[72]Come on in. \n[73]Guillermo was telling the truth. \n[74]How good is your Spanish? \n[75]Power of persuasion. \n[76]We're gonna have a good day.(Points to the migrants) Let's send these guys home. \n[77]Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything? \n[78]Have friends at Phoenix SWAT? \n[79]They any good? \n[80]Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we? \n[81]When he comes out of the bank. We need the deposit receipt to seize the account. Let him do the assault... we hit him when he comes out. \n[82]Endorsing over her paycheck. \n[83]When he walks out of the bank, we pull beside and you take him. \n[84]Now. \n[85]\n[86]We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then... \n[87]Don't you dare. \n[88]You can't arrest him. \n[89]You said that Ted. \n[90]The beauty of you being so beat to shit... No one's gonna notice a couple more scratches... this is a new game, Ted. \n[91]I'm the guy who will decide if your daughters get Federal protection or whether we post your ex wife's address on the internet. I decide whether you go to prison at a work camp in Missouri or a kill house like Corcoran. This is where you negotiate how to survive... \n[92]Good job. \n[93]You write it that way in the report.  Yes? \n[94]Real quick thinking, Kate. \n[95]Sure ... This is good news. They're going to call Manuel back. Soon. \n[96]Gotta have a little faith. \n[97]We may have the tunnel, right here. \n[98]We'll know soon enough. \n[99]Tasty beverage? \n[100]Going hunting. \n[101]We'll save that for later. \n[102]First thing, get that surveillance van operational. \n[103]Do it. \n[104]You aren't really dressed for it. \n[105]You went crying to daddy yesterday. We don't want daddy to know everything. Loose lips sink ships, haven't you learned that yet? Don't worry, we got extra-- \n[106]Relax. You guys will hang back when we get there, k? \n[107]Hey. All the drugs we find, you guys get to confiscate. Gonna be a big day. \n[108]What. What. What's he saying? \n[109]Where. \n[110]We're gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground. \n[111]Pretty exciting, huh? \n[112]On foot from here. \n[113]Weapons free, my friend. \n[114]Where is the target? \n[115]We need to boogie. And we need to do it quiet till we find the center. \n[116]Good luck. \n[117]They don't get freer buddy. \n[118]Cross this and it's new rules. \n[119]Is he through? \n[120]This was a clean, clean fucking op my friend. \n[121]She's not with you? \n[122]Okay, let's go. We're missing one. \n[123]Our government doesn't have assassins. We farm that out. \n[124]Refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade. Providing a measure of order. That we can control. \n[125]And until someone figures out how to convince 20 percent of the US population to stop smoking and snorting this shit, order is the best we can hope for... Alejandro is working to return that order. \n[126]He works for whoever points him toward the people that made him, Kate.

What would you like done here? \n[11]We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the `vibe' that we\"re winning? \n[12]Do you? \n[13]This isn't something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don't have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you're not. The boundary has been moved. Got it? \n[14]See what I mean?

They must have been involved. \n[77]They must have deserved it ... And for the family ... It soils every memory you have of that person. They make it impossible to imagine the face you loved without seeing the initials carved into her forehead.

Remember your child without ... \n[79]They kill the body, the memory, everything. \n[80]You remind me of my wife. I find it very difficult to look at you. \n[81]Get some rest tonight.

Out of the car. Now. \n[104]Walk back to your car. \n[105]A mule. Like you. \n[106]In the leg so you don't run. In the hand so you don't try to fight and make me have to kill you yet. \n[107]I know who you are, Manuel. You are no jefe, but you will drive me to one... \n[108]If you try anything, if you betray me, your daughters will burp the semen of twenty men with their last breath.

Continue. \n[117]Every night, you have families killed, and yet you dine. Tonight should be no different. \n[118]Eat. \n[119]Take the children away from here. \n[120]You. Whore. Sit over there. \n[121]You're not finished. Eat... \n[122]I will give you a choice, Fausto, one I was not given... You may choose to die tonight or live with the shame of having the mother of your children take your place... \n[123]Yes ... Choose. \n[124]See why you married her. Spunk. \n[125]Watch death come for you. Watch. The devil is near, Fausto. He is waiting for you. \n[126]This is what they think of you. You see? \n[127]Maybe you have enough pride that you don't marry another one of these. Maybe you take his money and go hide and raise your children far from here. Maybe your son grows up to be a doctor. And I don't have to come back and kill him some day. \n[128]I think maybe, it will be the thing that kills us all ... as a people, you know? \n[129]Stop it. \n[130]That will scar. I'm sorry. \n[131]Let me look ... Move your hand. \n[132]These ribs are bruised, but not broken, yes? \n[133]I would recommend not standing on balconies for a little while. \n[134]In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don't deserve the term. \n[135]Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen. \n[136]You look like a girl when you're scared. Such beauty in you when you let yourself be frail. Like the daughter they took from me ... This is not the work for you. Look at yourself, Kate. What it has done to you in just three days ... Find a little town far from the border. A place where the rule of law still exists. You will spot predators there very easy now... Make a difference you can see everyday. Because you will not survive here. You are not a wolf. This is the land of wolves now. \n[137]We like to think if we cut the head from the snake, the serpent will die... \n[138]But there is no snake. They are worms. When you cut the head, a new one grows. From both segments ... We cannot question if the end justifies the means because there is no end to consider... \n[139]This is the price of our self indulgence. Our weakness ... Our appetite. They are our demons, our creation. \n[140]There is a moment in each person's life. A choice. Do what feels good... Do what is good. Make the wrong choice enough, and it is not presented again... then all choices are bad. And the consequences worse. There is no war on drugs. Only war. The enemy we fight? Ourselves ...
