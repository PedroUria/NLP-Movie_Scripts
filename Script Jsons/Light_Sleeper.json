John? \n[6]Be comfortable. How did you hear about me? \n[7]It's a lot of money? \n[8]   \n[9]Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you do? \n[10]I see a woman who has betrayed you. \n[11] \n[12]Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you? \n[13]But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music? \n[14]You have a talent for music. \n[15]You still have it. It's strong. I see music in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take it. It won't seem promising. Take it anyway. You're full of stress. Are you exercising? \n[16]You should exercise more. You must let go of this stress. It's not good for your health. I'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem? It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction. \n[17]This was very important in your life. \n[18]You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters. \n[19]What is it? \n[20]You're young. \n[21]I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you. \n[22]   \n[23] \n[24] \n[25] \n[26]Do I know you? \n[27] \n[28]Step back. Again. Death. \n[29]This was not an accident. This person was murdered. \n[30] \n[31]I can't see it. \n[32]Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home. \n[33]Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep. ", "Ann": "\n[1]Darling. \n[2]Have we made New York safe for another weekend? \n[3]Any hundreds? \n[4]Goddamn cash machines. \n[5]These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market. \n[6] \n[7]Sleep tight. \n[8] \n[9] \n[10] \n[11]The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the \"Almilk\" formula. I remixed it. \n[12]Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California. What should we order? \n[13]Darling, it's Saturday. \n[14]\"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think.\" \n[15] \n[16]\"Ped Srilom\"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck. \n[17]Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on \"Oprah\" from a welfare hotel. \n[18] \n[19]Good for the trees -- \n[20] \n[21]Take a coat. And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes. \n[22] \n[23] \n[24] \n[25]I'm not supposed to be around -- \n[26]It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing. \n[27]It's still not easy. \n[28] \n[29]But you're dealing. \n[30]What's in the bag? \n[31]What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night? \n[32] \n[33]Goodbye, John. \n[34]  \n[35] \n[36] \n[37] \n[38]Shalom. See you next week. Don't eat any hot dogs! \n[39]It's all over the news. \n[40]We are careful. \n[41] \n[42] \n[43]One o'clock. C\u00f4te Basque. Is that too early? \n[44]Fine. \n[45]  \n[46]Thanks. \n[47]Yeah. \n[48]I don't think that would be a good idea. \n[49]One of us has to be here. \n[50]I shouldn't. \n[51]\n[52]She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does... Your mother -- that was a shock. \n[53]A year. \n[54] \n[55]It's... I don't want you to know about my life. \n[56]Details just open the door. \n[57]We were not. \n[58]He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer. \n[59]He was a Pisces. \n[60]It was not legal. \n[61]I was on the cusp. \n[62]We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down. \n[63]You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God. \n[64]In rehab they call this \"euphoric recall.\" You only remember the highs, never the lows. \n[65]I was drowning. \n[66]You watched -- \n[67]You did nothing -- \"It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible\" -- you still think like that. Actions have consequences; so do -- \n[68]-- inactions. \n[69]You always meant well. \n[70]Yes. \n[71]Ann? I'll believe it when I see it. \n[72]Are you really straight? \n[73]Let me see your eyes. \n[74]Eyes are deceiving. Congratulations. \n[75]What do you mean? \n[76] \n[77]You're crazy. \n[78]I have to get back. \n[79]You have any money saved? \n[80]What do you do with your money? \n[81] \n[82]Kitty Ford once told me, \"Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother.\" All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything. \n[83]You still go to meetings? \n[84]Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it? \n[85]What's the plan? \n[86]What you gonna do? \n[87]Too conceptual? \n[88]This time it's for real. \n[89]You took that before. \n[90] \n[91]I have feelings too -- you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week. \n[92] \n[93]  \n[94] \n[95]It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me. \n[96] \n[97]It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling. \n[98]You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another. I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you. \n[99]I remember. \n[100]What it felt like. What this tasted like. \n[101]John. \n[102]Come. Come with me. \n[103]Not with you. \n[104]Such an erection. \n[105]Weird. \n[106]I'm dripping. \n[107]Kiss, kiss, kiss. \n[108]This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye. \n[109]It's my fault. \n[110]Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee? \n[111]How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks. \n[112]Busting his ass. He's out doing your job. \n[113]Get confused on your day off. \n[114]Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it. \n[115] \n[116]Get out. \n[117] \n[118] \n[119]Have some shu mai. Just delivered. \n[120]About what? \n[121]What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? \n[122]You can't fool me. I can read you. \n[123] \n[124]Who knows what will happen? \n[125] \n[126] \n[127]It's -- \n[128] \n[129] \n[130]Spring roll. \n[131]The Prodigal Son. \n[132]Where were you? \n[133]  \n[134]The label for the cosmetics line. \n[135] \n[136]Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't. \n[137]Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No way I can fuck this. \n[138]This is business. \n[139]Tis won't deal with fags. \n[140]Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's new? So's everybody else. \n[141] \n[142] \n[143]  \n[144]It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but sometimes... \n[145] \n[146]You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God. You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers -- \n[147]-- never washed -- \n[148]I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous. It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything. \n[149]Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you. \n[150] \n[151]Oh. Okay. \n[152]That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it? \n[153]You don't want to know where it's been. Cologne? \n[154]Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals. \n[155]What's that? \n[156]What? \n[157]What is it? \n[158] \n[159]We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he? \n[160]    \n[161]Twelve-oh-four. \n[162]I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you? \n[163]And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass! \n[164]  \n[165] \n[166]Hi. \n[167]I look respectable. Any news? \n[168]It feels like forever. \n[169]I love your letters. \n[170]Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all. \n[171]Me too. \n[172]What do you mean? \n[173] \n[174]You had a hard-on... \n[175]You tried... \n[176]Me too. \n[177] ", "Manuel": "\n[1] \n[2]How'd you get in? \n[3]You buying? \n[4] \n[5]Piece?

How'd it turn out? \n[190]St. Luke's. \n[191]Not now. \n[192]Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic? He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever -- he's on you. \n[193] \n[194] \n[195]Nineteen is the top.

Remember me? \n[257]You said I should ask around, tell you something you didn't know. \n[258]It ain't much, but it's something. \n[259]A girl died last night. Lexington Ave. \n[260]The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else. \n[261]Who lives in the apartment? \n[262]That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something. \n[263]Jack.

You look terrific. \n[338]Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope. \n[339]It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading. \n[340]How's business? \n[341] \n[342]Did we ever fuck? \n[343]You know, make love. \n[344]We were naked, but did we --? \n[345]I didn't -- \n[346]I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did.
