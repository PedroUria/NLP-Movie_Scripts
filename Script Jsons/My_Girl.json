Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I didn't want the burnished handles. \n[20]Just put it back in the display room fellers. \n[21]They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes. \n[22]Of course not. \n[23]Short people, very short people. \n[24]Pardon? \n[25]Oh, You still want it?

Didn't I give you a picture of what she looked like? \n[39]This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker. \n[40]She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive. \n[41]That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm. Fix it. \n[42]What do you mean?? \n[43]Oh that, she just likes to play. \n[44]She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it. \n[45] \n[46] \n[47]Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh. \n[48]After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though. \n[49]\n[50]Oh Hi, what can I do for you? \n[51]Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family. \n[52]I wrote that. \n[53]I prefer it to \"instead\", it has more dignity. \n[54]It's no big deal. \n[55]I haven't been to the movies in AGES. \n[56]I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to. \n[57]\n[58]Nothing, I'm dressing. \n[59]\n[60]I'm very nervous. \n[61]The last date I had was twenty years ago. \n[62]Oh come on. \n[63]Are you sure about all this? \n[64]Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute. \n[65]No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look? \n[66]Goodnight Vada. \n[67]Ahh, I just wanna look nice. \n[68]Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together. \n[69]She likes to play bingo. \n[70]Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company. \n[71]Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much more activity. \n[72]No. Just, more activity. \n[73](as he sits down, to the person next to him \n[74]  \n[75]What's that? \n[76]Why d'you think these seats were empty. \n[77]Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100. \n[78]Oh, how do you mean? \n[79]Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game. \n[80]I haven't had a bingo partner in ages. \n[81]Okay, sure. \n[82] \n[83]It's nice. \n[84]Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems. \n[85]Yeah. \n[86]No, why? \n[87]Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died. \n[88]Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born. \n[89]I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was..... Did I ruin this? \n[90]Here? \n[91]Is there enough room? \n[92]I haven't danced in..... \n[93]Rock? \n[94]At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue. \n[95]Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic. \n[96]Want to what? \n[97]Yes. \n[98]I ahh, better go. \n[99]Goodnight Shelly. \n[100]\n[101]I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours. \n[102] \n[103]Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. \n[104]I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue. \n[105]Not at all. Lot of potatoes! \n[106]I'm looking forward to that. \n[107]HEY, OUCH, damn it!!

Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us? \n[121]Shelly? \n[122]Danny? \n[123]Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever. \n[124] \n[125]It's her home! It's where she lives!! \n[126]Danny..... \n[127]Who are you? \n[128]Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often. \n[129]Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front yard. \n[130]Is it really your camper? \n[131]You can get the general idea... \n[132]Yep, there they are...

She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl. \n[179]Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked. \n[180]That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.

Just for a minute. \n[96] \n[97]Home sweet home. \n[98]I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces. \n[99]You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush. \n[100]Are you mad at me? \n[101]I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and... \n[102]What happened to her? \n[103]Did she ever see Vada? \n[104]Dance with me? \n[105]This is where we are. \n[106]In ages, I know, me neither. \n[107]See, you're not that out of touch.

You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis. \n[153]Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine. \n[154]They were!! \"Popular Mechanics\", no \"Popular Science\". I don't know, popular. \n[155]\n[156]Oh look they're trying to hit that poor thing. \n[157]Perfect. \n[158]Oh great!! \n[159]Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish. \n[160]Vada we have something to tell you.

View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled up in a little ball on her bed Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings \n[178] \n[179]Hi. \n[180]Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone. \n[181]Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days. \n[182]Sure. \n[183]Bye. \n[184] \n[185] \n[186]\n[187]She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something Harry. \n[188]Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead. \n[189]Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, \"if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.\" \n[190]I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter. \n[191] \n[192]It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark. \n[193]We, no, we've been looking since this morning, her teacher called, and he said that she went there first..... \n[194]But I.... \n[195]Vada. Are you okay? Oh God. \n[196]\n[197] \n[198]I'm sure he knew. \n[199]It's okay sweetheart. \n[200]I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing. \n[201]Okay, get in to bed. \n[202]Goodnight. \n[203] ", "DeVoto": "", "Dr.": "", "Welty": "\n[1] \n[2]\n[3]You are perfectly healthy. \n[4]Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today? \n[5]Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you! \n[6]\n[7]No. \n[8]Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat. \n[9]Vada, what's wrong sweetheart? \n[10]Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look. \n[11]What Hurts Vada? ", "Bixler": "\n[1]Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you? \n[2]Really? Already? The summer's just begun. \n[3]No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J? \n[4]Better get on his case Vada. \n[5]Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up. \n[6]Well, you never can tell... I might get a pet. \n[7]Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work. \n[8]Thirty five dollars. \n[9]Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada? \n[10]It's summer! You're kids! Go play! \n[11] \n[12]The great way, is not difficult for those with no preferences, with the absence of both love and hate, everything becomes clear and undisguised. That was written by a Chinese Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I choose to bring that up in a creative writing class? Because, the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality. In other words, I want you to listen to your classmates writing, with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's gonna go first? \n[13]Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the part about the open heart... Vada, is there, something I can do for you? \n[14]For this class? \n[15]Vada, this is an adult writing class. \n[16]Vada, you sure you wanna do this? \n[17]Welcome to the class, go find a seat. Okay ahh, who's next? \n[18]The floor's yours Ronda. \n[19]Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada. \n[20]Please. \n[21]Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes and that's also good  but, you're not expressing to me what's in your soul. I want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets. \n[22]Before the class started, Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. \n[23]Vada, what did you feel. \n[24]Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J. \n[25]Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right? \n[26] \n[27]Oh, Vada... \n[28]Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you. \n[29]Suzanne, this is Vada. \n[30]Could you just give us a minute? \n[31]That's Suzanne. She and I are gonna be married this Fall. \n[32]I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please!
