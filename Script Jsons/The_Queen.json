Always warm. \n[22]And physical. Never afraid to show her feelings. \n[23]Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that, but still.. \n[24]That was always the extraordinary thing about her.

Gifts in tragically short supply around here. \n[37]I've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Highgrove? \n[38]Make sure we get a picture of that in the papers, would you? If my mother wants to make a mess of this, that's her business. I won't let her drag me down, too. \n[39]I've just been told.

CHARLES peers round the door..  He stares. Then, after a beat...  \n[45] of the WORLD's MEDIA whir and pop through the gates of Balmoral Castle.  It's an eerie, venal image. An unmistakable echo of DIANA's world, and her last moments in Paris.  The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid at the gates of Balmoral..  The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.  CHARLES holds his son's hand, and tries to concentrate on the flowers and wreathes and tributes.  uncomprehending looks. The beginning of a lifelong animosity. Suddenly.. ` in shock, and flinches privately.      Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the bullet at any moment..   \n[46] The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing the bag-pipes.       \n[47] The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS \n[48] The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress, emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being loaded with bags for the trip.  She climbs into a landrover, starts the engine.  SECURITY MEN stare quizzically at one another, then leap into life and dash to their own cars to follow  They drive out of the Balmoral Estate.

Is it his Lordship you've come to see? \n[5]There he is.. \n[6]Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An Imperial, Ma'am. Fourteen pointer. \n[7]Yes. We got our guest in very close, had him lined-up perfect, and still.. ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From London. \n[8]I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow him for miles - to finish him off. \n[9]I will, Ma'am. \n[10] ", "Ghillie": "\n[1] The HEAD GHILLIE listens, his expression changes in alarm, then..  \n[2]Are you sure, Ma'am? \n[3]And are you all right? \n[4]Mr Janvrin for you sir.

", "Robin": "", "Janvrin": "\n[1]The Prime Minister is on his way, Ma'am. \n[2]Yes. On the one hand his background is quite establishment. Father a Conservative. A public school education at Fettes, where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales. \n[3]On the other, his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years. \n[4]I wouldn't put it past him. He's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may remember her curtsey the first time you met. It could best be described as `shallow'. \n[5]And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal. Everyone on first name terms. At the Prime Minister's insistence. \n[6]Yes. \n[7] \n[8]I'm going to need to speak to her Majesty. Right away. \n[9]Tell Sir Guy I'd like everyone in. As soon as possible. \n[10]Good evening, Ma'am. I'm sorry to disturb.. \n[11]\n[12]  \n[13]Good evening, Sir. \n[14]Right. I see. \n[15]I've just spoken to our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am. \n[16]I'm afraid it's not good news. \n[17]I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've the Prime Minister, for you. From his constituency. \n[18]A bit over the top, don't you think? \n[19]Good morning, Ma'am. \n[20]Ma'am, there was a meeting at the Palace this morning. \n[21]The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these plans for you to consider. \n[22]There is now general agreement, Ma'am, that a public funeral would be more appropriate. \n[23]At the moment, they're suggesting.. And of course these are early days.. \n[24]...basing it on Tay Bridge. \n[25]Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the coffin. \n[26]And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe, the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen, fashion designers and other.. ...celebrities.. \n[27]o, Ma'am. \n[28]Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police Commissioner was keen that you consider the idea of a condolence book. It would give the growing crowds something to do. Make marshalling them easier. \n[29]Oh, and the flowers. \n[30]The flowers that have been left outside Buckingham palace. Currently they're blocking the path through the main gate, and will make things difficult for the Changing of the Guard. \n[31]Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we shouldn't leave the flowers, and send the Guards through the North Gate. \n[32]Right, we'd better have a look at these papers. \n[33] \n[34]Right... \n[35]Well, I'll try not to take that personally. \n[36]Yes, Ma'am. Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil. \n[37]Ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister is on the phone for you. \n[38]Prime Minister, I understand how `difficult' her behaviour must seem to you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. She's been brought up to believe its God's will that she is who she is. \n[39]She won't have seen anything like this since the Abdication. \n[40]And I cannot emphasise enough what affect that had on her. Unexpectedly becoming King as good as killed her father. \n[41]I'm most grateful, Prime Minister. \n[42]I'm afraid he's rather insisting. \n[43]I've done a draft of your television address. \n[44]No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes. \n[45]You think you can say it? \n[46]Prime Minister. "}}
