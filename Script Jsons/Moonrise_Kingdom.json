It might help also if you didn't wear fur. \n[13]Which way? \n[14] \n[15]He knows someone's watching him. \n[16] \n[17]It's my mother's. \n[18] \n[19] \n[20]Pretty good. I broke our school record for the back-stroke. \n[21]\n[22]The stick's moving! \n[23]Sit down! \n[24]Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you? \n[25]That's OK. He only eats cat food. \n[26]\n[27]This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music? \n[28]This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France. \n[29]These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want. \n[30]I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb. \n[31] \n[32]I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes. \n[33]Well, I can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our refrigerator. \n[34]It's not funny. \n[35]You really know how to make friends. \n[36]That's OK. \n[37]I know. \n[38]His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. \"My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and I no longer see his face in this reflection.\" \n[39]Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war. \n[40]Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got replaced as the raven because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue jay, but -- \n[41]Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter, especially trees and telephone poles. Is the girl in the water supposed to be me? My favorite color is -- \n[42]Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I threw a rock through the window. My mother still has glass in her hair. Also -- \n[43]Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended because I got in a fight with Molly. She says I go berserk. Our principal is against me. Why do -- \n[44]Dear Sam, I do think you should think of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad. It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves. Can you -- 38. \n[45]Dear Sam, My answer is yes. \n[46]Dear Sam, Where? \n[47]They found the canoe. \n[48] \n[49] \n[50]Oh, no. \n[51]He needs a doctor. \n[52] He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go? \n[53] Don't say that. \n[54] He's dying! We can't just leave him! \n[55] \n[56]Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me. \n[57]You're right. He's dead. 45. \n[58]Was he a good dog? \n[59]This is weird. \n[60]I like it here, but I don't like the name. \n[61]Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it. \n[62]Let me think for a minute. \n[63]It's pretty. Do the other one. \n[64]It feels hard. 52. \n[65]I like it. \n[66]You can touch my chest. \n[67]They're going to grow more. \n[68]It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power. \n[69]I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you? \n[70]That's true. \n[71] \n[72] \n[73]What's that one for? \n[74]Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much. \n[75]I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special. \n[76]I love you, too. \n[77]The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. \"It's windy,\" he said. \"Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers.\" Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people crazy. \n[78]Part Two. \n[79]That was a lie. \n[80]Good. I want to be. \n[81]What does it say? 57. \n[82] \n[83]Let me read it. \n[84]That's child abuse. \n[85] \n[86] \n[87]I wish I knew what makes you tick. \n[88]  \n[89]I hate you. \n[90]Why not? I mean it. \n[91]Exactly. I know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. You go to bed with him. \n[92]We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? \n[93]They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mach\u00e9 dummy in my bed. \n[94]Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again. 71. \n[95]\"-- but I'm not going,\" said Barnaby Jack. \"I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught.\" Annabelle whispered: \"I'm coming with you.\" Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. \"Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight.\" \n[96]He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow. \n[97]But we're not married yet. \n[98] \n[99]Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake. \n[100]Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to me. It might be better to just go steady permanently. \n[101]We're sure. \n[102]We might have to swim for it. \n[103]I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway.

A flash flood alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions. ", "Narrator": "\n[1]This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time. 3. \n[2]Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain Sharp? \n[3]As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. \n[4]What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. \n[5]This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community. \n[6]The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots.  The time is now four thirty-five A.M. \n[7]The Black Beacon storm was considered by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather to be the region's most destructive 102. \n[8]meteorological event of the second half of the twentieth century. \n[9]It lingered through six high-tides and inundated the islands with punishing winds and extreme high waters. \n[10]On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk and demolished the village bandstand and casino. \n[11]The coastal areas of New Penzance were battered and changed forever. \n[12]Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the map. \n[13]But harvest yields the following autumn far exceeded any previously recorded, and the quality of the crops was said to be extraordinary.

Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter? 29. \n[44]That's OK. We can share. \n[45]These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue. \n[46]Do you steal? \n[47]Why? You're not poor. \n[48]Are you depressed? \n[49]How come? 30. \n[50]Does that mean you? \n[51]To me, it is. \n[52]I'm sorry. \n[53]I'm on your side. 31. \n[54]Which one's the best? \n[55]Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice.

Unfortunately, it is -- 37. \n[58]Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard to make friends, but I feel people do not like my personality. In fact, I can understand why they might -- \n[59]Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you. That is more important. If they -- \n[60]Dear Suzy, Here is my plan. \n[61]Dear Suzy, When? \n[62]Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it. Turn right and follow to the end. \n[63]I will meet you in the meadow. \n[64] Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there. \n[65]What do you creeps want? \n[66]Why? \n[67]No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts. 42. \n[68]Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear? \n[69]Do not cross this stick. 43. \n[70]It was him or us. \n[71]They got Snoopy through the neck. \n[72]No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue. 44. \n[73]Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it. \n[74]They're after us. We got to move. \n[75] \n[76]I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never -- \n[77]Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die. \n[78]I know! \n[79]On three! \n[80]Me, neither. 51. \n[81]Let's change it. What should it be? \n[82]I made you some jewelry. \n[83]Are your ears pierced? \n[84] \n[85] \n[86]Why do you always use binoculars? \n[87] \n[88]What do you want to be? When you grow up. 53. \n[89] \n[90]It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean. \n[91] \n[92]Some people frown on these problems. \n[93]It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn. 54. \n[94]I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one. \n[95]I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. \n[96]I don't know. \n[97]Not to my recollection. \n[98] \n[99] \n[100]I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us. 64. \n[101] \n[102] \n[103]What happened? \n[104]Ah. \n[105]Thanks. \n[106]A drunk truck driver smashed into them. \n[107]Get out of my chimney. \n[108] \n[109]It's worthless to me.

Not without Suzy. 70. \n[110]How'd you get here? \n[111] \n[112]Where we going? \n[113]Can we trust him? \n[114]Did you leave another note for Lionel? \n[115]That's true. \n[116]Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned. \n[117]Yes, sir. \n[118]Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent? \n[119]I want to bring my wife. \n[120]I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him -- \n[121]What? Why? How? \n[122]I don't know what to say. \n[123] \n[124]We can't. It's her magic power! \n[125]You killed your dog, by the way. \n[126]Why do you consider me your enemy? \n[127]She's my wife now. \n[128]I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand. Why don't you like me? \n[129]I'm OK. \n[130] \n[131]Follow me! \n[132]How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket. \n[133]\n[134]  \n[135]they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me.
