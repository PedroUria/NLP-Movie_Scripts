He is anxious to make a. statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car. \n[102]No,. the old man's right. They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour...goin' to use them in the war, they say.

Tector backs off,. hands in the air. \n[104] \n[105]You're here with us,pardner -- any business you got with the general comes after we finish ours -- and that is selling horses.. \n[106]  \n[107]Let's get some beer and talk to the general about his automobile and our extra horses,,.nice and easy.

The others stand, hands an -theirguns,     58. \n[115]Mapache and the'others slowly rise, look at Angel, now realizing who shot the girl. 208 MAPACHE STARTS TOWARDS THEM. He pushes over chairs and shoves people aside as he approaches the group. Zamorra9 the Germans and other members of his retinue are close on his heels. \n[116]up to the'table and quickly scans the group.. Angel gets to his knees9 Mapache kicks him in the.head and when Angel. falls back, stamps him several times with his boot,, steps away. One of Mapache's men starts to bash Angel's head with a rifle` butt,. Mapache stops the man with a gesture,. then turns to the others. \n[117]He didn't, he was. after the girl... Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z'amorra with a puzzled expression. \n[118]He went a little crazy when he saw her with you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina. \n[119]Thought we might sell a few horses. \n[120]  \n[121]I. never heard of any American troops fighting down here... \n[122]We have vez\"y'few sentiments in common with our government. \n[123]Of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is the easiest to hit -- But I've got to figure where we can get out with. the wagon.     \n[124]Arms shipments are generally. kept secret ...how did you find out about this one? \n[125]'  \n[126]With your permission ...I need a bath. \n[127] \n[128]We better get him cleaned up...     \n[129]Por favor, General -- but I need him. \n[130]  \n[131]Some day I'm going to build me one of these and live in it.  I don't know why I \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 didn' t just let him kill you. \n[132]  \n[133]Move them a thousand miles away and buy them a ranch --. two -- three, ranches. \n[134]ANGEL PALES.. Both are ready to write Angel off. and forget about the problem. \n[135]Son -- twenty thousand cuts a lot of. family ties. \n[136]Twenty. \n[137] You can have one case and one case of ammo, You'll give up your share of the gold. \n[138]  \n[139]Pleasure-, Ma' ain. \n[140]WITH BARRELS) DRIVEN BY SYKES. The others are riding. behind. The walls of the arroyo tower above the men.

Aurora swings and catches him full handed across the face9 the groceries scatter on the floor -- Pike bounces off the wall,. looks at her, tries to grin. \n[145]Your husband due back? \n[146]No! He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops it, spilling hot stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking at the shambles on the stove and on the floor.' 236DD AURORA STANDS LOOKING AT HIM WITH LOVE, then smiling softly crosses to the side-board and pours him a drink. He takes it, suddenly both are laughing. \n[147]Suddenly Pike embraces her and pulls her to the bed. They begin to make love, then: THE DOOR SMASHES OUN AND LUKE, a skinny bad mouthed Texan steps into the room, a_double barreled shot gun in his hands ready to fire. AURORA SCREAMS and throws herself in front of Pike. Luke fires, the charge killing her as Pike dives out of bed -- jumping for his gun on a nearby table. LUKE FIRES AGAIN, the blast catching Pike across the thigh and knee. Pike goes down. Luke crosses to the bed and sits watching him writhing almost bleeding to death on the floor.     \n[148]She had a husband and I should have had enough sense to kill him. He wasn't around and I got careless. One night he.walked in on us - - got her with the first shot. He caught me here with the second then the damndd coward turned and ran. \n[149]Not yet but there-hasn't been.a day or an hour that I haven't thought about getting him - - he didn't want that woman he just. wanted to kill somebody - - well, he killed \n[150]This is the last go round - - this time we do it right. \n[151]266 THE ENGINE AND. TENDER AND FLAT CAR PULL\" SLOWLY away from \n[152] \n[153]290 THE CLOUD OF DUST OF THE APPROACHING BOUNTY HUNTERS. He yells down to the men: \n[154]Get the guns off and get on, out of here; He turns and scrambles down inside the cab. Outside the men quickly finish loading and the wagon pulls up alongside the cab. \n[155]Not yet - I want to return e. favor.. He.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2yanks the throttle into reverse and jumps off the locomotive onto the wagon. \n[156] \n[157] \n[158]Get on those rear. wheels'. The Gorch brothers scramble down into knee-deep water and begin to push. \n[159]heave against the wagon slowly moving. it up onto-the his.rifle but the range is far and the wagon has begun structure, then whirls as a bullet whines past his head. The shot has come from behind. Above and through the trees \n[160]Finally both turn and ride after the wagon followed by scat- tered ineffective shots of the soldiers, \n[161]is beside him. Sykes is still on the reins, Angel is sitting on the cases of guns. The Gorch brothers are both riding '14 horses on either side. Dutch looks up, shakes his head.- \n[162]Lyle; .Put your horse in the traces! 336 LYLE HANDS A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY TO TECTOR and nudges his horse forward.-As he swings off, it is obviaeas that he is a little drunk, \n[163]And you better dry out -- we got no cause to celebrate. \n[164]And we got a hell of a long way to go 'with a considerable number of people just waiting to take 'em away. \n[165]Agua Verde -- or before -- and when he \n[166]Last I saw he was ridin' four sticks of dynamite into the river. \n[167] \n[168]Let's move.- And they do, still chuckling-as we.; \n[169]Are they bluffing. or did they really miss it? \n[170]A lot depends on how hungry they are...

Angel., who.is sleeping _: his boot. \n[171]1. need some-help. 353 ANGEL QUICKLY GETS TO HIS FEET and follows Pike. to the wagon. Pike reaches into a box near the seat and removes a piece of fuse. \n[172]Get that case of explosives near the back. Angel climbs on the wagon. Lyle, hearing him,.crawls out from underneath. His brother also awakens and starts moving around. Sykes, hat. over his eyes, looks up but doesn't move.. \n[173]Protection. (as they look at \n[174]Now I'm goin' to make it real easy for something to happen. 35L PIKE SETS THE BOX ON THE GROUND and pries open the lid. He begins setting the sticks on the ground next to the box. Angel gets down and Pike hands.him a coil. of baling wire. \n[175]Wrap these in pairs and put a fuse cap between them. Angel takes the first two and starts to work on them. 355 LYLE WATCHES FOR A MOMENT THEN NUDGES HIS BROTHER and climbs 356 ANGEL AND PIKE ARM THE DYNAMITE STICKS in the shade of the wagon.. \n[176]You told them about our trail? \n[177]How? Angel puts the charge down and looks off at the horizon. \n[178].Whatever I don't know, I'm going to learn. \n[179] Hold up 1.. \n[180]Just hope. they don't belong to Villa. \n[181]Tell that one in front to come. over here ...Alone! \n[182] \n[183] Tell him to-come closer! \n[184] \n[185]You see this? He tickles. the end of the fuse-with the dead ash on his cigar. \n[186]Itts-a: very fast fus.e..,any trouble and no guns for the general. Herrera is solemn as he ponders for a moment, then begins to 'smile. \n[187]Nobody:..nunca nadiel \n[188]  \n[189]Go on back-and tell the General that one of us will. be there tomorrow for-the trade..1,any trouble -- no gunsb Herrera takes one last look at the guns. then he wheels his horse and. rides off.     \n[190]This isn\u00c2\u00b0t over yeti 376 HERRERA RIDES HIS HORSE TO THE BEND IN. THE RIVER then, reaching his men,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2reins his horse up and-turns him around. He whistles loudly and calls out : \n[191] Ride ahead a hundred yards and check the washes...  You and I will cover the flanks --  Keep on the gun -- watch the rim. \n[192] \n[193]Where? Angel smiles, then turns and calls softly. \n[194](his gun out, still hidden in the shadows Cut him loose 388 ANGEL SPEAKS, LED BY IGNACIO, THEY QUICKLY FREE TECTOR and hand him his weapons with murmured apologies. Tector looks at them, whistles, softly. \n[195] Don't break that fuse... Angel lifts a crate. \n[196]They part of your village? \n[197]How long have they been around? \n[198]How long have they been following us... close? 391 ANGEL EASES THE RIFLE CRATE DOWN, TWO PEONS TAKE IT. He turns to Ignacio. \n[199]If they ever get armed and led, this whole country'll go up in smoke. \n[200]Don't worry we got ' em...hidden. As soon as I. get 'my share of the gold I'll tell you where four cases are... $2500 worth..  The others are waiting at the wagon and unless I r eturn pretty damn quick they. blow it. 'Zamorra smiles, admiring Pike's caution. \n[201]Quicker I get back, the quicker the next load'll get here. 399 HERRERA BRINGS A SMALL WOODEN STRONG BOX. Kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and hands them to Zamorra. Zamorra hands them to Pike. \n[202]About two.. miles up the arroyo ... three cases of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it. \n[203]Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of ammunition -- for $10,000 -- not a machine gun. \n[204] I'll think it over. \n[205] \n[206]Just carryin' all this weight. He hold's up two bags of gold. \n[207] \n[208] You and your brother take in the next' load, and the machine gun - 'then Dutch and Angel. Sykes,. you follow them and pick up the pack horses...leave the wagon. \n[209]  \n[210]On a ridge above camp, using binoculars, they look across the badlands below and at the town far in the distance. \n[211]  \n[212] \n[213]PINPOINTS OF LIGHT APPEAR IN THE ROCKS ABOVE HIM. After a moment the noise of firing\u00e2\u0080\u00a2reaches them. .Dutch takes the glasses, watching.     \n[214]  \n[215]It'-9 his word2 \n[216]No water. \n[217]They'd be after us every step of the way -- I know Thornton. No, I'm tired of being hunted -- we go back to Agua Verde and let the General take,.. care of those boys. \n[218]He's so tickled with the guns he'll be celebrating for a week and happy to do us a favor. Thornton ain't going after us in there. While they're busy pick- ing over Freddy) we'll.' take the back trail off this mountain and head for town. The others look at him silently. Finally: \n[219]We take one sack to pay our way. \n[220]I hate to see an animal treated like that. \n[221]Maybe we- could buy him. They are silent for a long moment. Finally: \n[222]We,could use another gun. 450 MAPACHE, ZAMORRA AND THE GERMAN ADVISORS NOW GROUPED around the fire see the men. \n[223]I want to buy him back... Dutch and the others look at him surprised, \n[224]  \n[225]I'll give half my share to get him back. \n[226]You've had your fun with him... \n[227]Want to go hunting, General? Mapache looks at him confused. \n[228]Why not?. The group moves through the celebration out the main gate and into the village beyond. \n[229]SUDDENLY SWINGS OUT OF THE HAMMOCK and steps into the ad- \n[230]  \n[231]SITTING WITH A'BOTTLE BACK AGAINST THE WALL listening. to the plaintive sound of a distant guitar.. He.looks up as they come out. \n[232]Yeah. 464 THEY CROSS TO THEIR HORSES, THEIR DRUNKENNESS LESSENING with every step. Pike and Dutch pull rifles. or shotguns from their saddle scab- bards as do . Lyle.and-Tector,. then they move up the village street.. \n[233]We want Angel; Mapache stares at them without answering. \n[234]477 ANGEL'S FACE BEGINS to brighten with hope and he takes another step,. then: 478 MAPACHE GRABS HIM.BY THE HAIR and his other hand flashes across the boy's throat as he shoves Angel-into the Americans, the blood splattering them from his severed throat. .479 AS PIKE STEPS BACK TO AVOID-Angel's falling body, he draws his forty-five automatic and fires twice into Mapache. 480 THE BULLETS DOUBLE HIM AND HURL HIM INTO.HIS MEN.
