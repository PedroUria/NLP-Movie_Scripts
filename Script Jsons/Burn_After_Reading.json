You have to feel it or---- \n[3]I'll be back in a minute.     We'll work on opening those hips. \n[4]Oh wow.   Any good? \n[5]Click on, uh... yeah... \n[6]What? \n[7]Cripes.  \n[8]Did you have to send a picture?  \n[9]That guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.  \n[10]No, before.  \n[11]Yeah.    He uh, he might not be a loser.  \n[12]That's a Brioni suit.  \n[13]Shit yeah.  \n[14]He looks like his optometrist has a sense of humor.     \n[15]... Huh-huh-huh. What does he do? \n[16]That's cool. \n[17]Plugs. \n[18]Hi Linda.     Did you call that guy? \n[19]Holy shit... \n[20]This is some heavy shit. \n[21]No... fuck... \n[22]I can't believe this... This is like... intelligence shit. \n[23]This is, like, I can't believe this shit I'm seeing. \n[24]Manolo found this, like, CD just lying in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies' locker room. \n[25]And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or what, so I come in here and it's these files, man. \n[26]Like it's talking about SigInt, and signals and shit. Which, Signals means code, you know. \n[27]Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like, numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers... And numbers. I think                  * that's the shit, man. The raw intelligence. \n[28]Wul... Throw it out? \n[29]Put a note up? Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA shit? I don't think so. \n[30]Look,   Manolo... \n[31]...you didn't find this. \n[32]Yeah, I know, but\u00ad \n[33]Omygod. \n[34]Omygod. \n[35]Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you this on your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is. \n[36]The guy, the secret guy. \n[37]Um. I don't know if he's high up. Probably. I mean, I know his name, not like his rank. \n[38]Osbourne.    Cox. \n[39]Oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community. \n[40]Well I think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is. \n[41]Not what we know. \n[42]And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate. \n[43]Are you kidding? \n[44]Sources. \n[45]Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water? \n[46]... You know how far this is from my place? \n[47]I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie. \n[48]I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder. \n[49]Shall we give him a tinkle? \n[50]Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not. \n[51]Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            * Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary. \n[52]Hello? \n[53]Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox? \n[54]Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox? \n[55]I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried. \n[56]About the security.     Of your shit. \n[57]Your files----your documents. I know these documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing. \n[58]...

I'm just a Good Samaritan, like, a traveler on the road who has happened upon----  \n[64]Linda, I'll do it!  \n[65]You know, this is a major inconvenience for us and we thought, you know, a reward---- \n[66]Well, yeah, uh... why not? I mean, this is not----am I out of line here? \n[67]Hello?   We just---- \n[68](into the phone as he \n[69]... Geeze... \n[70]... I am very fucking surprised he did not give us the reward. \n[71]But it doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball. \n[72]Well, that's----he sounds very senior. I think this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time. \n[73]Yuh-huh. \n[74]Yuh-huh. \n[75]Right. \n[76]Yup.   It sure has. \n[77]Big time. \n[78]Well----you mean----go home and change? \n[79]I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have time? \n[80]Osbourne Cox? \n[81]Yes I am.    You have the money? \n[82]That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox. \n[83] \n[84]Appearances can be----deceptive.   I am a mere Good Samar---- \n[85]You think that's a Schwinn? \n[86]As soon as you give me the money, dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf! \n[87]... You fuck! \n[88]You fuck!

What is this? \n[100]   \n[101]Is there a men's room? \n[102]Very high up. \n[103]I'm just saying he's high up! \n[104]What?      Oh, yeah.   Yeah, he seems cool. \n[105]... That fucker really hit me. \n[106]Name, rank and serial number. \n[107]We, um... we know our rights. \n[108]I don't think so. \n[109]I'm at 1442 Westerly---- \n[110]I just---- \n[111]It was unavoidable.    This won't happen again. \n[112]Why did you tell him we could get more stuff? \n[113]That's all Manolo found! That was everything! What're we, gonna tell Manolo to scoop some more secret shit off the locker room floor! \n[114]What.  \n[115] \n[116]Yuh-huh.   I'm sorry.  \n[117]Right: Osbourne Cox.  \n[118]Um.

There are limits to my charity. \n[48]Yes.

Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom. He leaves the door open.  Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He rinses off, humming \"Born Free,\" and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau.  Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry stops, just outside the cracked door.  Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt. Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor.  Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again as Harry approaches.  Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.

I guess that's what's happened with me. You just... people change. We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You think it's forever. Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I'm not that person. The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia---- \n[24]... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too.

We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um---- \n[66]Of course not, but---- \n[67]Yes, but---- \n[68]No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You know that. I think he's an arrogant little geek.

Remember? \n[161]You never know what the important days are, until... until, um... \n[162]... I told myself I was gonna stop being paranoid, but... is that guy looking at us? \n[163]Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls. I don't think it'll take long. \n[164]Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke... \n[165]... Back when I was in PP there was still some art to finding people. Not any more. And now with the cell phones? Pretty soon they're gonna know where everyone is. Everyone. At any given moment. I mean it's almost the reality now. You would be amazed. \n[166]Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going? \n[167]Oh yeah? \n[168]Who are you? \n[169]\n[170]\n[171]", "Pfarrer": "\n[1] \n[2]  \n[3]    \n[4]   \n[5]    \n[6]   \n[7]    \n[8]     ", "Linda": "\n[1]And what about the face, you know, the window to the soul. \n[2]Baby crow's feet.

You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room. \n[52]Absolut Saketini, please? \n[53]You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling. \n[54]Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted! \n[55]Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body! I---- \n[56]That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel. \n[57]I am trying to get back in circulation. I have appetites and so forth, and, uh---- \n[58]Yeah----losers! \n[59]Omygod----is that you?! \n[60]Well jeez, that's a good job! \n[61]What happened? \n[62]Well that's my point!

You warn us? You know what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence? We warn you! We'll call you back with our demands! \n[89]Chad!    Don't play his game! \n[90]The nerve of that guy! \n[91]  \n[92]Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to let him know who's boss. \n[93]Yeah, that's why we got him, you know, we've caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer. \n[94]And us in the driver's seat. This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these. You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant. \n[95]Or this happens. \n[96]And right now this has happened. \n[97]This could put a big dent in my surgeries. \n[98]Harry?

I really do appreciate it, Harry. \n[107]That's not gonna go off, is it? \n[108]He's very very communicative. Very accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries. \n[109]He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor. \n[110]I told you, he's in the Treasury Department and he---- \n[111]Yeah, so am I! \n[112]No, you can't go like that!

If I'm going to reinvent myself I need those surgeries. And those surgeries cost money! This is not just fun and games!  \n[161]So let's figure this thing out!  \n[162]We know who he is  \n[163]So we can find out where he lives, right?  \n[164]You should change.   Into your suit.  \n[165]So you don't look out of place in the neighborhood. There are certain elementary things.  \n[166]Yes. We'll remove the laundry marks and labels. And you should not be carrying ID. \n[167]Deniability. \n[168] \n[169]   \n[170]    \n[171]I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry. \n[172]No no, I'm...
