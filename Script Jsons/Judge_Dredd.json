Anything you say will be held against you. Woozy from the blow to the head, Olmeyer nods, pleased. \n[21]You saved Mega-City, sir. You're a hero.

Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as re draws his massive LAWGIVER HANDGUN. Dredd speaks into the ::ny computer in the breech as he aims at the door. \n[6]Grenade. :'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBccM! The round knocks the steel door off its hinges. Dredd r:zxs :z aside and the Judges enter. \n[7]No. There. \n[8]This room is pacified. mcves carefully through the smoke. Behind him, Hershey and \n[9]spins around. Sees Brisco dead in the doorway. Snarls, enraged. Hershey whirls, KICKS down one of the wounded who tries to escape in the confusion. \n[10]You're all under arrest. Will you surrender, or would you like your trials now? a :.a_nsaw, and it's decimating Dredd's hiding place. \n[11]  \n[12]  \n[13]He's lost his Lawgiver! He reaches out for it - and gets kicked in the head! CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Twist, sudd enly courageous \n[14]Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:.

Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart. \n[20]Court is adjourned. \n[21]He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns. \n[22]  \n[23] The guide wire in the floor isn't working.  Five! Four! \n[24]Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, citizen. He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall. \n[25]- Let's see your Unicard. \n[26]FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers...  Cash machines, robot taxis... And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours. \n[27]Not at all. You could have climbed out a window, worked your way down. Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable. \n[28]Maybe. But it would have been legal. I sentence you to five years in. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away. s-': protesting, Fergie is hauled away. Hershey looks at Dredd. \n[29]Yes. And cowardice isn't one of them. \n[30] A rookie Judge died there, too. I guess he wasn't worth mentioning. \n[31] \n[32]Chief Justice? \n[33]They were unavoidable, sir. Out there... that's the reality. \n[34]With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook. \n[35]At the Academy... Sir. \n[36]It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your footsteps. \n[37]Kevlar nine helmet and body armor. WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one \"Q\" ran in the Bond movies. Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet off. The class OOOHS and AHHS. \n[38]Yours, when you graduate. If you graduate. \n[39] Lawgiver Two. Twenty five round sidearm with mission-variable voice programmed ammunition. Signal Flare. He turns, FIRES. The FLARE explodes on the wall. Again -000HS and AHHS. \n[40]Yours, when you graduate. \n[41]Now he moves to several Techs who are hurriedly tweaking the most awesome LAWMASTER CYCLE we've seen. \n[42]Mark IV Lawmaster, improved model. With on-board cannon, vertical take off and landing,. flight capacity and 500 kilometer range. The head Tech gives thumbs up while the other techs step back. The class waits, expectant. The lead tech throws a REMOTE. SPARKS fly. The motor COUGHS, dies. The class GROANS. Dredd glares at the embarrassed technicians. \n[43]Yours... if they ever get it to work. LAUGHTER. Dredd moves to a lectern. Faces the class. \n[44]All of these things are nothing but toys. Bottom line, final word, end of the day, when you're alone in the dark... all that counts... is this. takes something from the lectern shelf, throws it down. It's all-but holy book: THE LAW. \n[45]And you will be alone. Because when h T e': Frown; this is not what they expected to hear from a legend. They become increasingly unnerved. \n[46]For most of us t'here is only lonely death on the streets... or, for those few of us who survive to old age... the prouder loneliness of the Long Walk. \n[47] \n[48] Life, Liberty, and the Pursuitof Happiness. Old and noble ideas. But they are what we give to (Xi others... not what we will ever receive for ourselves. Class dismissed. The class breaks up on a definite low note. \n[49]   \n[50]Really. How long since you saw any of them? \n[51]You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial. \n[52]How many married Judges do you know? \n[53]Yes. Once. \n[54]  \n[55]Is this your car? \n[56]Of course not. Towing is the penalty for the first offense. This is your second violation.  Grenade. \n[57]  \n[58]They're Judge Hunters, Hershey. They're the ones who come out when a Judge has broken the Law. Hershey reacts; she's heard of them. \n[59]Judge Hershey. I don't have anyone else to ask... Will... will you be my defense attorney? \n[60]Murder. (X \n[61]That is the Law, Judge McGruder. I would expect no less. \n[62]Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me. \n[63]I'm still glad. CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward. \n[64]That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass. \n[65]They look at each other, as puzzled as everyone else. JUDGE DREDD 39 Rev. #2: 17/3/94 \n[66]Do your job. She nods, stands. \n[67]You did your best, Judge Hershey. He stands, takes her hand. \n[68]Thank you. \n[69]   \n[70]Okay. W::.h a SNAP and without looking, Dredd jerks his elbow ba_xwards. The prisoner is knocked unconscious. As he sags in .is :hains, CAMERA ADJUSTS. The prisoner on the side of Dredd we haven't seen is Fergie. Now, he stares at Dredd. Then \n[71]I was convicted of a crime. Wrongly convicted. \n[72]No. You got the sentence the Law required. The Proper sentence. \n[73]The Law does not make mistakes. \n[74]  \n[75]Angel: Maybe if your youngest fruit hadn't taken those hostages he could be here for the family reunion. As one, all the Angels lunge forward as much as their short chains will allow. Fergie recoils; Dredd doesn't. But two GUARDS turn at the commotion. (X' \n[76]No. \n[77]Look out - Misunderstanding his intentions, the nearest guardZAPS him with his Stun Club! At the same moment, Pa Angel getsthe other guard's weapon, turns it on him! The guard DROPS.One of the Angel boys grabs the key card! \n[78]turns, charges forward - but two Angels have already whisked the key card over their cuff's ,canners! They tackle the guard! \n[79] \n[80]punching, twisting, fighting the hands reaching for his throat. As the aircraft banks steeply, he slides alon the floor with his enemies. SEES a Judge's LAWGI trampled under the scrambling feet. Reaches for it - reaches - reaches - \n[81]\n[82]Hack the shuttle, now! Fergie pushes the pilot's body aside, hits controls. Meanwhile the convicts are swarming against the cage door. \n[83]What the hell's wrong? JUDGE DREDD 52 Rev. #1: 16/4/94 \n[84]CAMERA PUSHES IN on him. \n[85] Rico? That's impossible... O.S. SCREAM. Fergie wakes with a start, REACTS to the dramatic shafts of sunlight raking the cathedral ceiling. \n[86]You have just committed murder. The penalty isdeath. Reverend Angel HITS Dredd. \n[87]Ah... Fergie... \n[88]Actually, youre toast: I arrested the Angels oar Cannibalism. JUDGE DREDD 60 Rev. #1: 16/4/94 \n[89]seeing this, he jumps up. \n[90] \n[91]pulls the guy he's struggling with in front of him! The BULLETS hit him! Dredd wrenches the weapon from the man's dying fingers - SHOOTS the Hunter beside Fergie! \n[92]Fargo? BLOOD wells on Fargo's coat. e's been hit. As he sags, Dredd and Fergie rush towards him.H \n[93]No. You and the first Judges... you saved Mega-City. \n[94]But.., but the orphanage told me my parents were killed by lawbreakers -- they gave me that picture of them - \n[95]What do you mean, both times? \n[96]I have a... brother? \n[97]  \n[98]Like I trusted you? \n[99]  \n[100]  \n[101]To find Rico. \n[102]\n[103]The vent from the city incinerator. There's a burst twice a minute. That means that there's 30 seconds for someone to run through the tube before it flames again. \n[104]Actually, they were burned to a crisp. But the theory's sound. Let's go. FOOM. Another FIREBALL belches from the city wall. As Fergie stares at it, Dredd starts forward. It's a few paces before he notices Fergie hasn't moved. \n[105]What's wrong? \n[106]Fergie. There's a maniac loose in \n[107]My fault? \n[108]The Law doesn't apologize. \n[109]I was when I sentenced you. \n[110]Run! C=ouched over, they race up the slight slope. \n[111]Stop counting! \n[112]FAINT light starts to fall on him. 'Then he SEES it, up ahead -the lights of Mega-City! Dredd pushes on - reaches the opening! Turns to look at..,- \n[113]He looks outside - so close - looks back - so far - it's impossible to save Fergie! \n[114]Dredd looks down - SEES \n[115]'v::.- a-= :he strength in his body, he RIPS the conduit free from =^e floor - YANKS it forward - As he shouts \"TWO\" he is whipped forward like a trout on a line! \n[116]Has landed half-buried in a mound of ashes. He looks around. \n[117]Fergie? Dredd hears a muffled SOUND beneath him. He reaches down... YANKS Fergie into view. Fergie spits out a mouthful of ashes. \n[118]  \n[119]I don't. But I trust the Council. When I tell them about Rico... \n[120] \n[121] \n[122] \n[123]He shakes his head, gets up - sees Rico is gone, but Griffin is \n[124]You're mine. \n[125]They enter the training center and Dredd runs right towards the ,--_ Marie IV Lawmaster! Leaps into the saddle and kicks over the en=ine! Spins around and heads back the way he came, grabbing =ergie en route! \n[126]Turns again - he's flanked! He spins on the bike, takes the only direction left: Back into the training room - a dead end. Al; the Judges and Guards follow, BLASTING away. \n[127]He races directly for the WALL! His fingers stretch out, hit a control marked \"CANNON\". \n[128]  \n[129] \n[130] \n[131]Hershey. What is it - ? \n[132]You think I'm-part of this - r^ 40 CONTINUED: 24C \n[133]  \n[134]  \n[135]Him... and Griffin. \n[136]There is no Council, Hershey: They were all murdered an hour ago. \n[137]The same. Inhuman. Defective. He just broke down, first. \n[138]How many times have you said I had no feelings, no emotions? Now you know why. \n[139]It's not the same! They had parents, they embraced their humanity... they didn't hide it... fight it... question it! \n[140] Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much... \n[141] Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority. Pause. without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted emotional territory. \n[142]Will ...wi11 you help me, Hershey? Not as a Judge but... but... as my friend? ::'s the most ordinary request anyone could make... anyone but Dredd. Hershey understands how much it means. She fights back :ears, puts her hand on his arm. \n[143]Central, I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab, immediately! By now the CAMERA is in Olmeyer's student pod. Olmeyer, Fergie and Hershey are in a corner, watching and whispering. : edd is on the other side of the cubicle, at a Central Station. ' r e's wearing his own helmet and badge again. \n[144]  \n[145]You're helping them? \n[146]But they're breaking the law! Who the hell programmed you? \n[147]Fine! I'll file charges! \n[148]  \n[149]Fergie, you've got to have something - a password, a kluge - \n[150]Come on, you cracked the food robot... the shuttle computer - \n[151]Scared..? \n[152]First that Goddamn computer turned on me. Then, you! CRASH! Fergie's head hits a LIGHT FIXTURE. The bulb EXPLODES. \n[153]That's the idea! Another BULB EXPLODES. \n[154] The Lab was top secret. It had to be in an out of the way place to stay secret. Right? \n[155]  \n[156]Red Quad, Section 5: The oldest part of Mega-City. Olmeyer turns, looks off. \n[157]What? \n[158]Almost at the flying cycle. Hershey hesitates at the shots. Dredd grimly pushes her towards the bike. \n[159]  \n[160]       \n[161] \n[162]No.  Edsel, here still has another \n[163]  \n[164]I'm nothing like you. \n[165]Dredd reacts, startled to hear this twisted version of his own earlier words. \n[166]Drawn despite himself, he stands beside Rico, head turned up like his clone brother's. They never looked more alike. Dredd looks into the glass of the Incubator Chambers just above him. Inside, still forming HUMAN SHAPES, male and female, suspended in milky fluid. \n[167]You get nothing from me, Rico. You've betrayed the Law. \n[168]When Aspen thaws, Rico. Go to hell. Tense seconds. Rico grins boyishly, lowers the gun. \n[169]whirls, FIRES down at Rico. Rico dives for cover... manages to grab his Lawgiver! He FIRES back up at Dredd! \n[170]He's trying to keep Rico at bay, but he's clearly outgunned. Reloading behind cover, he SEES Fergie in the doorway. Crawls over to him. Fergie's ashen, his shirt soaked with blood. \n[171]Fergie. \n[172]I. I made a mistake. I... I'm sorry I misjudged you. \n[173]And I'll never arrest you again. \n[174] \n[175]He's a one man mobile artillery charge, AIMING, FIRING and snou;..nq commands to his computerized weapon! \n[176] \n[177]  \n[178]fumbling along in the smoke. Suddenly another half-formed CLONE rears up in his face! It mews horribly, clutches at him! Dredd FIRES a burst at it. It fa s away, vanishes in the smoke! \n[179]Rico. Dread is on top of a big console. \n[180]Here comes the Judge. - -IVES down on Rico! Each man grabs each other's wrists! h T e Lawgivers both FIRE wildly. Dredd and Rico carom off ec:u\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 pment , FALL! \n[181]The round HITS HIM like a pile driver! His SHIRT catches FIRE! He falls backwards over a railing as the SMOKE coils upwards! \n[182]On the floor below, chest blackened, trying to catch his breath. He REACTS as the lights go out. Seeing a LIGHT in the smoke, he crawls to it. His face falls when he sees its one of Central's \n[183]Central! Can you - \n[184]Okay, you win. I'll give myself up to Chief Justice Rico. Where is he? \n[185] \n[186]That's for Fargo! That's for the u Co ncil! That's for Fergie! \n[187]Signal Flare! And as he SHOUTS it, he uses his last strength to smack the weapon away! \n[188]He watches his brother fall. Starts to climb up... a boot steps on his hand. He looks up. bruised, bloody - angry! Then - WHAM! A FIST SMASHES into her \n[189].. It's over. \n[190]No. Just a Judge. I did my job.

We need them today! \n[6]Who knows if that's even possible? \n[7]Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name \"Janus\". \n[8]Yes.

Dredd WHISPERS. \n[30]You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else. \n[31]It clearly shows nothing! Your Honor, I have here an affidavit from Cadet Olmeyer, currently a Junior at the Academy. Svc IN THE AUDIENCE 102 heads of the other cadets around him swivel to look at him .:_` new regard. He does his best to look cool. \n[32]Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case.  I ask for a ruling. \n[33]returns to the defendant's table as the court quiets down. Olmeyer WHOOPS a second longer than everyone else. Embarrassed, he quiets down, but not before Dredd notices him., \n[34]Trust me. It's not your ass he's interested in. \n[35]They look at each other, as puzzled as everyone else.

Pause. We can almost hear Central thinking. Meanwhile, behind Hershey, a figure in a Judge's uniform approaches her Bike... \n[58]Central. I want an answer. \n[59]  \n[60]Mc%,inc carefully, Dredd and Fergie walk down the corridor. Dredd's still in the stolen uniform. They come to a nameplate with Hershey's name on it. ,We WIDEN. The door has been forced oiler.. \n[61]Up against the wall, now! The figure complies. It's Fergie. \n[62]  \n[63]Dredd! '_- a moment she's elated. Then her face hardens. She holds n steady. \n[64]Stay where you are. \n[65]They're dying out-there, Dredd. A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours. Everyone who's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin. I thought it was organized criminals, revolutionaries, something... then I was a target. \n[66]I don't know what to think anymore. Dredd moves like lightning - pins her gun hand against the wall - then freezes. It's a challenge, not a threat. She glares at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's deliberate check-mate on both their parts. \n[67]Secrets can hurt more than anything. She relaxes her hold on him. Throws something down. \n[68]Tell me about him, Dredd. Make me believe in you again the way I did when I defended you. \n[69]And he's doing it again? \n[70]Griffin? We have to tell the Council - ! \n[71]She's been on her feet for days and this is the last psychic blow. She sags. Dredd catches her. \n[72]  \n[73]  \n[74]No! \n[75] \n[76]Dredd. The Janus project didn't do that to you. You did that to yourself. He turns, startled. Realizes she's right. \n[77]Never the Law, Dredd. Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment. \n[78]I'd be honored. Dredd reaches over, squeezes her hand. There's absolutely nc:n.nc sexual about it - and that makes it even more powerful. \n[79]Central. This is Judge Hershey. I hereby file formal charges of murder against Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico. And I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab so that I may personally make the arrest! \n[80]Dredd, you're scaring him! \n[81]Central! I need to see the city power grid! \n[82]Scan through all the grid sections. Random selection. RAPID IMAGES now: Different neighborhoods of Mega-City, all depicted as COMPUTER GRAPHICS of color and pattern. \n[83] \n[84]What about you - \n[85]Almost at the flying cycle. Hershey hesitates at the shots. Dredd grimly pushes her towards the bike. \n[86]Down there. CAMERA ZOOMS BACK. They're on the artiall ruined HEAD of the STATUE OF LIBERTY! Now, t ey DESCEND into the torso. \n[87]  \n[88]  \n[89] \n[90]She flinches even though she knows Dredd is aiming around her. But Dredd's 30-30 bullets barely, dent the robot! \n[91]s-=a-: a dance towards each other... \n[92]Dredd! Catch! She throws the Remington \u00e2\u0080\u00a211sa dropped to Dredd! \n[93]Cor...nue to struggle hand to hand. Ilsa breaks free - goes into ^.er blurring Karate moves - finishes as always with a savage K7.--K to the crotch - \n[94]Hershey just grins. \n[95]You don't fight girls much, do you? She grabs Ilsa's ankle, flips her! \n[96]still fighting. Ilsa gets in one, two terrific blows. \n[97]Judge Bitch, to you! Hershey CLOBBERS her with a right! \n[98]S::rprised by the darkness, Ilsa falls, sliding on the slick floor. TILT up. Hershey, limping, comes towards her. :lsa foot-sweeps her to the floor! \n[99]Grenade. BLAM! The incubators EXPLODE. \n[100]No. That's not for him. ", "Rico": "\n[1]Hello, Warden. \n[2]Have you come for another... chat? \n[3]\"Innocent\"? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, \"Guilt\" and \"Innocence\" are merely a matter of timing. \n[4]Am I? When did you become a perpetrator? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account? Or the time I was sentenced to death? You've been taking bribes for years, Warden. You're a criminal. And a stupid one: You don't even know who's paying you. \n[5]If ignorance is bliss, Warden, then you must be very blissful. Miller, why are you here? \n[6]The Ancient Puzzle, Miller: The One about the Meaning of Life. \n[7]It's over. And he AIMS the \"puzzle\". BLAM! \n[8]You're holding a package for me. I'm.

Geiger hits the floor. \n[12]I must be a Judge. Rico bends, takes Geiger's keys and his cigars... then goes to the big cage. \n[13]Status: Personal bodyguard. Commander: Rico. Mission: We're going to war. Geronimo. \n[14]I like to do things my way. \n[15]  \n[16]Dredd only worships the Law. And he'd blow you away the minute he found out just how much you're pissing on it. Trust me: It's better this way. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen. Let him see what it's like I to be me! After all... He moves closer to Griffin, smiles. \n[17].Dredd and I have so much in common. Why not this? Griffin looks at him, decides to drop the subject. \n[18]Yes. The Janus lab - \n[19]Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can handle that. After all...  Look how quickly I brought fear in here. His smile fades and he exits. \n[20]  \n[21]Hello, Professor. \n[22] I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul. \n[23]Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do. He puts his arm around her. They step over her victim on their way out. \n[24]Come on, you piece of junk...  No offense. The bolt loosens. Rico can open the panel. \n[25]Let there be Light. He flips a switch. The OVERHEAD LIGHTS come on.

But it won't mean a thing if you can't get into Central's Janus files. They're still security locked. \n[28]\"Fear, Terror, Panic.\" Yes. My favorite emotions. \n[29]C'mon, Fido. Walkies. The robot follows Rico and Ilsa out the door. Griffin watches them go, slightly unnerved. \n[30]  \n[31]Who says politics is boring? \n[32]Why didn't you kill him when you had the chance? \n[33]Central... I'm touched. \n[34]Slight change,. of plans, Central. I want to purge that DNA sample. \n[35]The same thing you are: House-cleaning. Mock-annoyed, she throws a cleaning rag at him. She turns on he droid. It moves off, polishing the floor. Curious, she icins Rico. \n[36]Central, active the DNA sampling console. :4-nind Rico, another CONSOLE lights up.

Corners on the curves. \n[42]Me. \n[43]Yes. A mutat;on that made me the next step in human evolution. \n[44]Really? What's your excuse? \n[45]You're lying! All you care about is control! Well, the next batch of Janus Judges won't be the puppets you want... they'll be my brothers and sisters, mine to control! \n[46]Why not? I'm going to breed some more of me... the old fashioned way. \n[47]You will be. \n[48]Griffy. You shouldn't have done that. Fido is very loyal. \n[49]That's right, Griff. You gotta get with this hi-tech stuff. Robot: Tear off Judge Griffin's arms and legs. Save his head for last.

They got hit, toot CAMERA RAKES to the control panel... and a SMOKING, SIZZLING section. The craft tilts alarmingly. Dredd grabs the stick, helps Fergie try and pull up. It's useless. \n[22]Ohmigod, I'm dead. I'm dead! And in hell. \n[23] \n[24]Amen, brother! Say it! \n[25]Go tell it on the Mountain! \n[26]He smiles as the Angels start to release him. \n[27]Well, Dredd.

It's one of the Hunters Dredd took out earlier, still alive enough to aim his weapon! Dredd aims his stolen one \n[33]I buried him. Except for this. Dredd silently follows Fergie to the grave.
