Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about? \n[7]Wow. Fascinating. \n[8]The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time. \n[9]As we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. What are we really looking at here? \n[10]Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in. And finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live. \n[11]And that's the way the cookie crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News. \n[12] Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album. \n[13]So, what do you think? \n[14]It sucks. It's a story about a cookie. People with eating disorders will be riveted, Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece. I can't wait to vomit so I can make room for more cookies. \n[15]What? I'm cutting that. They made me wear that stupid thing. I don't even look like myself. The hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. Right out of the gate, I lost the hair advantage. \n[16]Grace. Try to stay focused here. I need your help. \n[17]It's sweeps Grace. It is serious. There's an anchor job open. This is important. This is our future! \n[18] \n[19] \n[20] \n[21]You look pretty intense, hun. \n[22]So, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say? \n[23]I was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, I may lose my resolve. \n[24]Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. From the diaphragm. That's the way the cookie crumbles. \n[25] \n[26] \n[27]...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty Minutes. \n[28]We are in. . .     \n[29] Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce. \n[30]No, I'm having a great dream. \n[31]Of course they lost, they're my team. \n[32]\"And that's the way the cookie crumbles.\" You know, I think there might be something to that cookie line. Everything great anchor has his own signature sign-off. \"And that's the way the cookie crumbles.\" \n[33]Oh no!   Grace, the dog! \n[34]Ah! \n[35]Whoops, sorry. \n[36]Oh, you're all done, huh? B-e-a-utiful. \n[37]Yeah, if you want to rub your success in people's faces. \n[38]What's with the hubbub? \n[39]Creepy. Needles, yech... \n[40]I mean, it's just s o . . . \n[41]C'mon, that's your...blood. It's in your body and I don't think it's supposed to come out. Besides, they stockpile that stuff. They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage. \n[42]Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive they aint touchin' me with no needle. \n[43]What's that? \n[44]Well, I hope they work, cause it's going take a miracle to get me to work on time. \n[45]This is just my luck. \n[46]The meeting's starting, perfect... Screw it. \n[47] \n[48] \n[49]Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go- I'm late... \n[50]Bobby, I can't, I-- \n[51]Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go. \n[52]Can you get Kelly- Ahh... \n[53]Really? \n[54] \n[55]Keep the change. \n[56]Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault. The traffic was -- You guys already played the spots? \n[57](re: Evan's perfect \n[58]Is you're posture naturally that good, or do you have to shove a stick up there? \n[59]Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you for a second? \n[60]Sweeps. \n[61]Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm getting desperate man, I am pushing forty and what have I got to show for it? The point is, I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. Some kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And Evan is just lovin' it, by the way. He gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more like Evan. \n[62]I can be an asshole. \n[63]Yeah, I'm sorry. \n[64]It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... \n[65]Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan. \n[66]Maid of the Mist. That's always live. \n[67]Evan gets the live feeds. \n[68]I'm going live. In sweeps. \n[69]Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. I will not forget you when I go national. \n[70]Grace? \n[71] \n[72]Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got sweeps and I'm live. You know what that means? \n[73]They're seeing if I can think on my feet, like you might have to do in a live news anchor situation. \n[74]This is happening for us, Grace. What we've always talked about. Jack practically came out and told me. \n[75]Well, he didn't spell it out, but this is exactly what happened to Susan Ortega right before she was bumped up to the desk. \n[76]I totally agree, but in the mean time you should start thinking about what coast you want to live on. \n[77]Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go. \n[78]I love you.                                            * \n[79]What for? I'll get soaked. \n[80]Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes. \n[81]And people who are insanely                    '     * thirsty, I get it.                                   * \n[82]90 seconds, going live. Think anchor, think dignity, Ignore umbrella. Just have fun. \n[83] Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in shock. Evan is seated next to Susan.    \n[84]Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist at Niagara falls. \n[85]First off, \"I want to add another congratulations to Evan Baxter. It's good to see what someone with real talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead of me. Anyway, I'm here, I believe with Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me, why did you toss the blue \"heart of the ocean\" jewel over the railing of Titanic? \n[86]Did you feel guilty at all letting Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you were safe floating on the big door? Do you think he would have survived if you had taken turns, or were you too afraid to freeze your big fat ass off? \n[87]Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it? Some people are drenched, freezing to death, on a stupid boat, with a stupid umbrella... while others who aren't fit to kiss my willy, are sitting in a nice, comfy news room, sucking up all the glory111 \n[88]Now, lets speak to the owner. Come on in here, Bill. \n[89]Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me, why do you think I didn't get the anchor job? \n[90]Do you think it's my hair? Maybe my teeth aren't white enough? Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life slowly erroding underneath me. Erroding. Erroooding. Errodiiiing... \n[91]I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness news. Back to you fuckers 1 \n[92]Hey, come on guys. What are you doin'? Just leave him alone. \n[93]Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'. \n[94]B-e-a-utiful. \n[95]Just what you get for trying to help someone. \n[96]Get a clue, buddy. \n[97]Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip. \n[98]God, yeah. Let's thank God. Thanks for everything, Lord. I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan. \n[99]Oh, don't worry, he's not listening. If he is he doesn't care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's God. They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. I think it's time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs. \n[100]Think about it, Grace. God is all- powerful . He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to. \n[101]But he doesn't want to. He doesn't like me. \n[102]Oh, Perfect! But you're aim isn't so good, I'm over herel \n[103]Of course not. It's part of the mysterious plan. \n[104]Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi And I'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. I'm not okay with a mediocre job. I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE! \n[105]Terrific. I'm drowning and you throw me a brick! \n[106]Perfect! I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please. I-- I don't need this. \n[107]Okay, God. You want me to talk to you? Then talk back. Tell me what's going on? What should I do? Give me a sign... \n[108]I'm right here. Speak to me. \n[109]All I need is some guidance. Please send me a signal. \n[110]Oh well, I guess you don't care. \n[111]Okay, we'll do it your way. Lord, I need a miracle. Please help me. \n[112]Come on, where'd you go? Ah ha! AHHH! \n[113]Okay, if that's the way you want it. The gloves are off, pal! Let me see a little wrath! Smite me oh mighty smiteri What, no pestilence no boils? Come on, you got me on the ropes, don't you want to finish me off?! You're the one who should be fired! The only one around here not doing his job is YOU! What are we, you're little pet project? A hobby you tinker with now and again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!! \n[114]Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't call you if I did. \n[115] Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up, begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.     \n[116]Well, hello again 772-5623, don't hold your breath. \n[117]Oh, no. \n[118]What's the point? \n[119] \n[120] \n[121] \n[122]Perfect. \n[123] \n[124]What about the elevator? \n[125]What? Yeah, I mind. \n[126]Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this joint... \n[127]Yep, seems to be. Kinda bright, though. \n[128]Oh, the elevator's broken, huh? \n[129]You installed a clapper? \n[130]I gotta go. \n[131]Oh, this is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor. \n[132]How do you know my father? And how did you get my pager number? \n[133] \n[134]Who are you? \n[135]Sorry, it's not ringing a bell. \n[136]Oh, you're God. Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me. That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly. Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse. \n[137]Okay, I don't know how you're doing that, but I really gotta go. This place is obviously rigged in some way. We're on some freaky hidden camera show. ...for which I will not sign a release, by the way! But you know what, I'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion. \n[138]Everyone with a      brain in their head would know that      the drawer is being \n[139]Okay.     That's good.   That's a good one. \n[140]Okay, God. How many fingers am I holding out? \n[141]Okay, how about now. \n[142]AH HAl \n[143]AAAHHHl \n[144]You stay away from me! I don't know what your doing. But whatever you're doing is probably actionable! \n[145]Job? Wh at job? \n[146]Sure, whatever you say, Pal. \n[147]Okay, that did not happen. \n[148]No. \n[149] Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't start. \n[150]I'm having a breakdown. That's what it is. Just a normal, everyday psychotic episode, brought on by tumor or brain lesion... \n[151] \n[152] \n[153]Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and I do not have his powers. If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. \n[154]\n[155] (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must \n[156]It isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real... \n[157]Oh hi, ah, coffee please. \n[158]No, that's okay. \n[159]Alright, okay. \n[160]Excuse me I need a spoooo... \n[161]That's alright, I found one. \n[162]What? \n[163]Okay. \n[164]You- He- Thy... \n[165]Rules ? \n[166]Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit. \n[167]Uh huh.   Can I-ask why? \n[168]This is amazing. \n[169]Where are you going? \n[170]God can't take a vacation. Can he? Can you? \n[171]\n[172]...Right. \n[173]And he saw that it was good. \n[174]B-e-a-utifull \n[175]Hey guys, remember me? \n[176]Look, I don't want to fight you guys. So as soon as you apologize, I'll be on my way. \n[177]What a coincidence. That's today. \n[178]Now I'm going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson. \n[179]Just me... and me... \n[180]And me, and me, and me, me, me, me, me and me and me. \n[181]\n[182]Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal \n[183]I'll take it from here. \n[184]Back home for you, little one. \n[185]He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the unpleasant aftertaste and walks off. \n[186] We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and proclaims to the world. \n[187]\n[188]\n[189] Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine, sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine. \n[190]What if God was one of us. . . Just a slob like one of us... Just a stranger on a bus... Trying to make his way. . . \n[191] \n[192]You can call me Bruce. \n[193]Who wouldn't be on a night like this? For you. \n[194]It's a totally new breed. A cross pollination between tulips and Daisies. I call them Todayzees. \n[195]Nothing of this world. Why? \n[196]Last night, I was only human. \n[197]CD 4, Track 7. \n[198]We shouldn't waste it. \n[199]Bedroom. \n[200]Don't rush yourself. Sometimes                        * anticipation can heighten the                         * pleasure.                                             * \n[201]It's a funny thing about, pleasure.                   * \n[202]It can be extremely pleasurable.                      * \n[203]Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a casual pose. Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal. She dives on Bruce, attacking him. \n[204]Sam. Uh uh uh. \n[205]Good boy. \n[206]Good morning. \n[207]Oo, my favey. \n[208]Heavenly? \n[209]Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the same to me. \n[210]You got me. Probably just a hormonal thing. Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've gotta run. \n[211]To get my job back. \n[212]Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling \"What if God were One of Us.\" \n[213] \n[214]He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window. \n[215]Well, it gets me from A to B. \n[216]And the last shall be first. \n[217]Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video camera. Phil spots him. \n[218]Yeah, I had a bad day. But things are lookin' up. \n[219]Just lookin' for a story. \n[220]I don't know. My instinct tells me there's something more. \n[221]Since the disapearence of Teamster president Jimmy Hoffa in the nineteen sixties, his whereabouts have remained one of this country's great unsolved mysteries. That is until just moments ago, when during a routine training session, a police dog named Hank sniffed his way right into the history books. As you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a hospital facility where DNA testing will confirm the identity. That, of course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records. Sort of a two-in-one for Hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with four kilo's of marijuana. \n[222] \n[223]That's the word. \n[224]No, thank you, I'm not hungry. \n[225]No. \n[226]I'm really not interested. \n[227]Bobby, I-- \n[228]No, I really- no... \n[229]No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I didn't want anything. Damn you... \n[230]* \n[231]No harm no foul, Jack. I needed some time off to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self. \n[232]Imagine what I can do with seven. \n[233]What's that? \n[234]Oh, I'm busy doing...things. \n[235]Jack, don't worry about that. Just give me a camera and a crew and I'll give you the news. \n[236](casual to an amazed news \n[237]Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems some type of meteor or asteroid has, by chance, hit the earth right behind the Mark Twain Chili Cook Off. . . \n[238]. . . So remember, it's sky diving season at Old Pete's airfield. This is Bruce Nolan.. My rip cord appears to be a bit stuck. \n[239]This is a very unfortunate turn of events. I'm heading toward the earth at a very precarious speed... \n[240]Ah ha!     You are real! \n[241] Bruce sits watching a hockey game on TV. He follows the puck intently with his eyes, as though controlling it's path. \n[242] \n[243]In the past, zoo officials have been unable to get these Panda's to mate, but that doesn't seem to be a problem today. \n[244]And the mood seems to be catching o. . . \n[245]Oh, say can you                                       * seeeEEEEeeeeeEEEEeeeee...                             * \n[246] Grace opens the bathroom door, revealing SAM, SITTING ON THE TOILET SEAT WITH A NEWSPAPER UNDER HIS FRONT PAWS. Sam BARKS and Grace quickly closes the door.  \n[247]...eeeEEEEeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEeeeee. . .                    * \n[248]Bruce finishes running a bath, gets into the tub but SLIPS as is UNABLE TO SINK and ends up sliding around ON THE WATER like on a sheet of glass. He tries to break through, can't. Then, he concentrates and finally LOWERS INTO THE WATER. \n[249]...of the                                              * \n[250]...and that's the way the cookie crumbles. \n[251]Very good. If you run out just bring me some water, I'll take it from there. \n[252]Huh? Oh, no this is fine right here. \n[253]I was going to wait until after the meal, but I think it's going to just bust out of me if I don't do it now. \n[254]You ready? \n[255]I got anchor. \n[256]Evidently, they're having problems with Evan. He's finishing up the week and I go live Monday. \n[257]Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor. We got anchor! \n[258](noticing her flat \n[259] \n[260]Well, sure. Just one second, hun. Fans. We better get used to this, huh? \n[261]Oh, thanks... \n[262]Wow.
