Huh?  \n[12]\tYou're insane. \t\t \tBut -- you might also be brilliant. \tAlright, Andy... let's do it.  George warmly extends his hand.  Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.

ABC has seen your foreign man \tcharacter, and they want to turn him \tinto -- \t\t(he checks his \t\tnotes \t\"Latka,\" a lovable, goofy \tmechanic!!!  Long pause.

Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his mind.  \n[39]\tBut Andy says he's fabulous. \t\t \tHe also says, these are the terms.

Where...?  \n[43]\tAlright, I'm here.  What do you \twant?  Tony puts down his fork.  He pauses... slowly turns around... and is Andy.  George GASPS.  His eyes bulge.  Andy smiles innocently.  He gestures to an empty seat.  \n[44]\tI... I-I don't understand this act. \n[45]\tYeah?  Well tell that to the poor \tschlub who you humiliated!  Beat -- then Bob strolls over.  His real name is BOB ZMUDA.  \n[46]\tSo your name's not Gorsky.  \n[47]\tThis has to stay in the room... but \there's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And \tTony is Andy!  They'll deny it up \tand down, but I swear to God, \tthey're the same person! \t\t \tIt's smart business!  You'll get two \tAndy Kaufmans for the price of one!  Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and then he cracks a smile...  \n[48]\tAndy!  \n[49]\tAndy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed \tto it all!  They thought your terms \twere a shining example of your \t\"irreverent wit\" -- and precisely \twhy they want you! \t\t \tYou're getting EVERYTHING!  Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.  \n[50]\t\t\t\t(worried at this \t\t\t\tresponse \t\t\t No... eh, the Special \t\t\t isn't all like this... \t\t\t just wait... it will be \t\t\t hysterical.  At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard scowls.  \n[51]\tNo, um... it's part of the snow.  An awful beat.  Maynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes.  \n[52]\tHey!  Could you clear this table and \tbring me a piece of poundcake?  Andy turns.  They stare down each other.  \n[53]\tAndy, this is ridiculous.  Take off \tthat apron.  \n[54]\tLook, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! \tBut we work in a creative business. \tYou can't predict what people are \tgonna like --  \n[55]\t\t \tTell you what.  I'll book you on \tsome concerts, and meanwhile, we'll \tshow the Special around... see if \tsomebody wants to buy it --  \n[56]\tYou signed for five years -- \t\t \tSo four years, seven months.  \n[57]\tWhat kind of show was this??! \t\t(angrily reading off \t\ta LIST \tThere were three-hundred walkouts! \tThe promoter wants a refund!  Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper.  \n[58]\tYou're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! \t\t \tAnd you -- you're the road manager! \tYou should be watchin' out for him!  \n[59]\tWhen you play the Midwest and South, \tyou DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! \tIt's not postmodern -- it's rude. \t\t \tIf you wanna perform in Texas, you \tgive 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em \tElvis!!  \n[60]\tAnd that's great.  But do it in LA \tand New York!  There you experiment! \tShow up with a sleeping bag and take \ta nap on stage!  I don't care!  Hmm.  Andy thinks.  \n[61]\tI don't know! \t\t(he composes himself \t\tand lowers his voice \t\tto a hush \tAndy... you need to look inside: Who \tare you trying to entertain?  The \taudience... or yourself?  \n[62]\tI'm worried about Andy.  His stress \tlevel is affecting his work.  \n[63]\tBob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if \tyou can get him away from all this. \tTake him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find \tsomething special.  Something \tnice...  Zmuda mulls this over.  \n[64]\t\t \tI'm not sure how Andy's gonna take \tthis...  \n[65]\tBut that's Tony down there.  That's \tnot Andy.  Trust me, it's like \t\"Sybil\" -- Andy's nowhere on the \tpremises!  Ed glares.  \n[66]\t\t \tOkay.  But we'll have to warn Andy \tfirst.  I think he's up in San \tFrancisco, doing a concert.  Heh?  Ed raises his eyebrows.  \n[67]\tHi, Diane, this is George.  I'm \ttrying to reach Andy up in San \tFrancisco. \t\t \tYeah, I'll wait.  Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no longer there.  He's magically vanished.  Beat.  George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy voice pops on the line.  \n[68]\tHi, Andy.  How's the weather up \tthere?  \n[69]\tI'm here with Ed over at Taxi. \tThere's been some trouble with Tony.  \n[70]\tThere'll be other shots.  \n[71]\tEhh -- Andy doesn't really like \tplaying casinos.  The audiences \tdon't work well for him.  \n[72]\t\t \tReally?!  You want Tony Clifton to \theadline Harrah's Tahoe??  \n[73]\tLook -- I gotta be clear with you. \tTony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.  \n[74]\t\t \tNo, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, \tdo NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.  \n[75]\tFine, be my guest!  Book him.  \n[76]\tGene, you misunderstood!!  You're \tnot getting BOTH of them! \t\t \tIt's physically impossible!  \n[77]\tYeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- \ttrust me, it's not gonna happen!  \n[78]\tYou're so proud.  You're like some \tretarded kid comin' home from \tschool: \"Look, Dad, I got an F!\"  \n[79]\t\"Funny\"?  I dunno.  But \t\"intriguing\"... \"mindboggling\"... \tperhaps \"headache-inducing\"... sure. \t\t \tLike, that moment, when you both \tcame onstage...  Andy excitedly jumps up and down.  \n[80]\tSo you've got this big elaborate \tjoke, which is really only funny to \ttwo people in the universe. \t\t \tYou... and you.  \n[81]\t\t \tBut what's the POINT?  How will any \tof this make you the biggest star in \tthe world?  Hmm.  Andy contemplates this.  \n[82]\tBut I feel you're extending this \tphilosophy to real life.  It's \tobsessive.  Nothing's ever on the \tlevel anymore.  A perplexed beat.  \n[83]\tMerv Griffin has received 2000 \tpieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv \tGriffin doesn't GET hate mail.   \n[84]\tNo, I'm not gonna take it.  If I \ttake it I'll break my back.  He crosses his arms.  Andy frowns and lowers the weight.  \n[85]\tBuddyboy, they detest you!  Next \ttime you make an appearance, women \tare gonna picket.  \n[86]\tWRONG!  You haven't given them any \tclues that it's a parody!  \n[87]\tAndy, do you realize you don't do \tcomedy anymore?  Where's that sweet \tguy who used to do \t\t(he SINGS Mighty \t\tMouse \t\"Here I come to save the day!\"? \t\t \tPlease, enough with the wrestling! \tYou've lost touch with reality!  \n[88]\tHe is the Southern Heavyweight \tChampion.  He'll kill you. \t\t \tFirst, you piss-off women.  Then you \tpiss-off the South.  Then you get \tkilled! \t\t \tAnd I did the bookings.  Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake.  \n[89]\tAndy, look... there's a job I want \tyou to take -- guest-hosting the TV \tshow \"Fridays.\"  It's not so hot... \tbut this is a great opportunity for \tyou.  The show's live, they'll give \tyou carte blanche, and you can get \tback to the business of making \tpeople laugh.  Andy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing.  \n[90]\t\t \tYeah, he's just laying low, waitin' \tfor his comeback. \t\t(he sees an article \t\tand winces \tGod, listen to this!  \"It was \tmorally wrong to take advantage of \tsuch an unstable individual...\"  \n[91]\tThanks for seeing me on such short \tnotice. \t\t(he takes a careful \t\tbeat \tI... I wanted to talk to you about \tbooking Andy on \"Saturday Night \tLive.\"  Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably.  He chooses his words.  \n[92]\tWe agree completely. \t\t \tAndy has to reconnect with his core \taudience.  So I got him on Letterman \ttonight.  He's gonna apologize to \tJerry Lawler, then repent for all \this bad guy shenanigans.  Lorne Michaels mulls this over.  \n[93]\tHe's very sincere. \t\t \tAnd he needs your show...  Beat.  Lorne Michaels nods.  \n[94]\tAnd this wasn't \"Merv.\"  This was \tthe hippest audience on television. \t\t \tThey've turned on you.  At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to Andy.  But only the back of his head is visible.  \n[95]\tIt's like you two guys wanted to \tdestroy Andy's career!  Upsetting \tall those people... putting out that \ttoxic venom... \t\t \tWhat did you THINK would happen?!  \n[96]\tYou're BLIND!  There is no envelope \tanymore!! \t\t \tIt hurts me to say this... but \tthere's only one solution -- \t\t \tI don't want you two to ever work \ttogether again.  We WIDEN...  And the other person is JERRY LAWLER.  He feels bad.  \n[97]\tAndy!  You don't get it! \t\t \tThey don't want you back.  Andy's face drops.  \n[98]\tAndy... it's me.  I've got some \tcrummy news. \t\t \tTaxi's been canceled.  Silence.  Andy has no response.  \t\tGEORGE  (cont'd) \tDo you want me to come over?  Talk \tabout it?  \n[99]\tHey, what's going on here?  \n[100]\t\t \tWhy...?  Andy, why...?  \n[101]\t\t \tAndy, they don't think you suck. \tThey've just... lost a reason to \tlove you.  The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks.  \n[102]\tYou've gotta make the public embrace \tyou again.  You have to win back \ttheir sympathy...  \n[103]\t\t \tExcuse me -- but could Andy tell us \twhy we're here???  All heads turn.  A long pause.  Then -- Andy stiffly speaks.  \n[104]\tFORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! \tI want nothing to do with this.  Pause.  Lynne is puzzled.  \n[105]\tThat's ridiculous.  You don't even \tsmoke.  \n[106]\tAndy... you look me in the eye, and \ttell me this is true.  Andy gulps.  \n[107]\tIf I find out you're behind this, \tI'll kill you.  \n[108]\tExactly.  That's the sort of thing \tyou guys would work out to fuck me \tup.  \n[109]\tWhat was that all about?  \n[110]\tHe's an actor.  I remember him in \t\"The In-Laws.\"  Ah.  Andy's eyes widen.  His wheels are spinning fast.  \n[111]\tYou must take a little pleasure in \tit.  \n[112]\tAndy, you're surrounded by what you \tcreate.  You are the KING of \tnegative energy.  \n[113]\tSo how can I help you...?  \n[114]\tDo you wanna tour the clubs?  \n[115]\tThat's great... but this show's \tgonna cost a fortune.  Even if it \tsells out, you'll still lose eighty \tgrand.  Andy smiles.  \n[116]\tSo who's gonna pay for it?  \n[117]\t\t \tYou know Tony doesn't have that kind \tof money.  \n[118]\tOkay, Andy.  Will do.  \n[119]\t\t \tYou've got good days and bad days.  Andy softly sighs.  \n[120]\t\t \tYeah...  George silently pats Andy.  Andy's energy is sapped, but he forces himself to be upbeat.  \n[121]\t\t \tI think we can sell that.  Silence.  George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.  Andy smiles gratefully.  \n[122]\tDid your -- doctor say it's okay for \tyou to go back to work?  \n[123]\t\t \tReally?  \n[124]\tThe Philippines?  I dunno...
