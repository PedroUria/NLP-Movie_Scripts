After a beat:  \n[31]\t                Thank you, sir.

But Decker has an \t      obvious reply:  \n[64]\t                The carbon units are of no \t                consequence; V'ger will determine \t                their purpose.  \t                              McCOY \t                Their purpose is to survive.  \n[65]\t                That is also V'ger's purpose.  \t      Decker's face reflects his bemusement:  \n[66]\t                That is how V'ger will survive.  \n[67]\t                I wish to continue my observations.  \n[68] \n[69]\t                By the Creator.  \n[70]\t                To learn all that is learnable; \t                to deliver all collected data to \t                the Creator on the third planet. \t                That is the programming.  \n[71]\t                There is no logical reason for \t                carbon units to control Enterprise's \t                power systems.  \n[72]\t                        (to Decker; \t                         interrupting \t                As I stated, V'ger calls to the \t                Creator.  \n[73]\t                'To learn all that is learnable.'  \n[74]\t \t                Decker...

During which:  \n[18]\t                I have accepted service here as \t                a Starfleet officer... sir.  \n[19]\t \t                We are being scanned, Captain.  \n[20] \t      as Kirk whirls toward Spock's station, calls out:  \n[21]\t                Intruder scans emanate from \t                the exact cloud center. \t                Energy of a type entirely un- \t                known to me.  \n[22]\t                Twelve power energy field --  \n[23]\t \t                Captain, I suspect there's an \t                object at the heart of that cloud.  \n[24] \t      Decker turning to Spock  \n[25]\t                They have... they <u>have</u> been \t                communicating with us.

I sensed \t                <u>no</u> emotion, only... \t \t                ... pure logic.  \t      Kirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on \t      the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex- \t      pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's. Kirk faces \t      Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to- \t      ward his chair, calling to Ilia.  \n[36]\t                Recommend we proceede, Captain.  \n[37]\t                Instruments fluctuating, Captain. \t                Patterns unrecognizable.  \n[38] \t      (This will be the first time we've seen Spock dislay- \t      ing a definite reaction, almost an emotion.) So \t      engrossed is Spock in the main viewer IMAGE that he \t      appears not to have heard Kirk, whose AD LIBS a sharp \t      \"<u>Mr. Spock</u>...!\" Spock looks absently at Kirk an \t      instant, then:  \n[39]\t \t                That vessel is generating a \t                forcefield measurably greater \t                than the radiation of the Earth's \t                sun.  \n[40]\t \t                A probe from their vessel... \t \t                A plasma-energy combination...  \t      Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who \t      sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.  \n[41] \t      as the \"probe\" withdraws an energy-tendril from one \t      bridge station and \"inserts\" it into another console.  \n[42]\t                This served the purpose.  \t      Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now \t      turns abruptly, and:  \n[43]\t                Captain, we have been seized \t                by a tractor beam...!  \n[44] \t      as Spock studies his readings, and:  \n[45]\t                We cannot break free, Captain. \t \t                We do not have a fraction of \t                the power necessary. \t \n[46]\t                Break free to <u>where</u>, Commander...? \t \t                Any show of resistance would not \t                only be futile, Catain...  \n[47] \t      as Kirk reacts somewhat curiously to Spock's remark, \t      but it is Decker who articulates it:  \n[48]\t \t                Something about us puzzles them... \t                perhaps even concerns them.  \n[49]\t                The tractor beam has released \t                us, Captain.  \n[50]\t                        (manipulating \t                         controls \t                Commencing sensor scans.  \t      Kirk rises, goes to Spock's station.  \n[51] \t      at his Science consoles, working rapidly, shifting from \t      one set of controls to another. Now he hits a master \t      control -- his console monitors FLASH, then go dark.  \n[52]\t                Captain...  \t      Spock brings a monitor IMAGE ON again, indicates a \t       pattern showing a line hitting something, \t      then reversing direction.  \n[53]\t \t                <u>All</u> scans are being reflected \t                back, Captain.

How?  \n[57]\t                Who is the Creator?  \t                              McCOY \t \t                Mr. Spock, be careful.  \n[58]\t \t                Doctor, a thorough examination \t                of this probe might provide some \t                insight into those who manufactured \t                it, and how to deal with them.  \t                              McCOY \t                Let's get her to sickbay.  \t      And he grasps \"Ilia's\" arm to escort her. But is as \t      though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is \t      thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's\" remaining sta- \t      tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:  \n[59] \t      as everyone reacts to \"Ilia's\" utterance of Decker's \t      name. It seems to make the deepest impression on \t      Spock, confirming something he has suspected. \t \n[60]\t \t                Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?  \t      \"Ilia\" continues peering at Decker with just a hint \t      of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition. \t      It's the first time we've seen her expression look \t      anything but cool and bland. This results in the \t      quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.  \n[61]\t                Captain... this probe may be a key \t                a key to the Aliens.  \n[62]\t                We have just seen that its body \t                duplicates our navigator in \t                <u>precise</u> detail. Suppose that \t                beneath its programming, the \t                real Ilia's memory patterns are \t                duplicated with equal precision.  \n[63]\t \t                ... they may have followed it \t                <u>too</u> precisely.  \n[64]\t                Exactly. \t \t                And you did have a 'relationship' \t                with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.  \n[65] \t      looking very troubled as they watch Decker and \"Ilia\" \t      leave. Kirk notices.  \n[66]\t                I am uneasy with that being \t                our only hope of more information.  \t      Spock EXITS.  \n[67] \t      His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly \t      with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention. \t      Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant \t      has applied a <u>Vulcan nerve pinch</u>. The Tech slumps over \t      his console.  \n[68]\t                Computer, commence recording. \t                Captain Kirk -- this message \t                will detail my attempt to \t                contact the aliens...  \n[69] \t      His features now set into an almost trance-like expres- \t      sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations. \t      Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he \t      moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue \t      jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins \t      to move off in the direction he was concentrating \t      upon.  \n[70] \t      His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber \t      then dropping down into a deep \"trough\"-like area \t      which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A \t      cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS  become \t      visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis- \t      tance and does not attract them.  \t      We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall \t      of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an \t      unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem \t      to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance. \t      (Here, also, we will become aware of \"sensor-bee\" \t      swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall \t      from all points of the chamber.  \n[71] \t      Spock's spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA, \t      as we HEAR:  \n[72] \t      as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now \t      is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's \t      expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster \t      JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall, \t      then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the \t      way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call; \t      he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS \t      FLARE, and:  \n[73] \t      as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.  \n[74] \t      with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the \t      CAMERA. As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his \t      phaser. Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS -- \t      he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete- \t      ly encased spacesuit. Spock makes a quick phaser \t      adjustment.  \n[75] \t      Spock levels the phaser carefully. FIRES. The PHASER \t      BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces \n[76] \t      facing each other while hovering in space.  \n[77]\t                I am seeking answers, Captain.  \n[78]\t \t                Captain, I believe there we will \t                find an indication of whoever -- \t                or whatever -- is aboard this \t                vessel...  \t      Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster \t      controls and begins moving in the direction Spock \t      indicated.  \t      Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the \t      point on the inner wall.  \n[79] \t      as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE \t      THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless. \t      Then Spock sees something, indicates.  \n[80] \t      This \"sensor swarm\" has been coming from a direction \t      that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then, \t      as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs. \t      He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.  \n[81] \t      Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something \t      with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask \t      -- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it \t      tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE \t      VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the \t      one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's \t      throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts \t      to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner \t      wall.  \n[82] \t      From this closer distance, <u>we SEE that an opening ap-</u> \t      <u>pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes</u> \t      <u>immediately</u>.  \n[83] \t      closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their \t      movements to coincide with the arrival of another \t      \"swarm\" -- the wall begins OPENING. The \"swarm\" \t      through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and \t      Kirk slip in before it closes.  \n[84] \t      The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside. \t      But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes \t      widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:  \n[85] \t      as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what \t      they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder \t      again, propels himself toward the memory crystals. \t      Kirk follows.  \n[86]\t                It would appear that the atomic \t                arrays of these crystals store \t                information. A remarkably \t                efficient system.  \n[87]\t \t                New crystals: they must contain \t                the most recent data obtained --  \t      And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be \t      <u>shinier</u>, more <u>pulsating</u> than the others): ANOTHER  \n[88]\t \t                Exact patterns. The energy bolt \t                that hit them wasn't simply a \t                weapon -- it dematerialized them, \t                stored them. But why?  \t      And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall, \t      consulting his tricorder.  \n[89]\t                Captain, I do not believe there \t                <u>is</u> a crew -- or that this is a \t                vessel as such.  \t      A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.  \n[90]\t \t                I am almost certain now that all \t                of this <u>i</u>s V'ger -- I believe \t                that we are inside a life form, \t                a <u>living machine</u>.  \t      Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to- \t      ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di- \t      rection. Then a glance to Kirk.  \n[91]\t                I <u>mus</u>t attempt mindmeld with it, \t                Captain.  \t      Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER \t      JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.  \n[92] \t      preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the \"liv- \t      ing area,\" the invisible force even stronger -- but \t      Spock's strength unwavering, and now he <u>touches the</u> \t      <u>surface</u> -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the \t      touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses \t      as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are \t      charging through him.  \n[93] \t      as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA \t      CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth \t      open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF \n[94] \n[95] \t      MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES \t      . Symbolizing V'ger's \t      incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge, \t      these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules, \t      galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human \t      knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or \t      twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us \t      through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.  \n[96] \n[97]\t      ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His \t      eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a \t      catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings. \t      Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical \t      scanner over the brain area.  \n[98]\t \t                Jim...  \t      And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised \t      Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance \t      with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend- \t      ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.  \n[99]\t \t                This <u>simple</u> feeling... \t \t                ... is so far beyond V'ger's \t                comprehension.  \n[100]\t \t                A life form of its own; a \t                conscious, living entity.  \n[101]\t                I saw V'ger's planet: a planet \t                populated by living machines. \t                Unbelievable technology. \t \t                V'ger has knowledge that spans this \t                universe. \t                And... in all this order... all \t                this magnificence, V'ger feels \t                no awe...no delight... no beauty... \t \t                I should have known...  \t      Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too \t      weak.  \n[102]\t \t                No meaning...
