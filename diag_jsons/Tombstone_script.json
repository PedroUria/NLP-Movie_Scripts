But it's Not too late for you, Morg. \n[104]All the years I worked the Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job.  I don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but... I don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain.  At First I just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside.  But When it finally sunk in what I'd Done... Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way. Not ever. Didn't even make a dent, did I? You're both makin' a big mistake. \n[105]This Hooker's ranch? \n[106]You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion? \n[107]Well you must've seen somethin', The trail runs right by your Waterhole.

You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours. \n[117]They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one? \n[118]And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand. \n[119]This brand. \n[120]Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business... \n[121]Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it. \n[122]Oh, hell... \n[123]We've never actually met.  My Name's- \n[124]I know what it means. \n[125]Easy now...

That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. All right, what's your idea of heaven? \n[139]You mean Behan? Then why are you with him? \n[140]The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that. \n[141]Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it. \n[142]I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.

Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason. \n[262]Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust. \n[263]We should get moving. \n[264]I don't like it. \n[265]You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there. \n[266]I made a promise. \n[267]But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.

Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it. \n[276]What happened? \n[277]All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way. \n[278]So're the Cowboys.
