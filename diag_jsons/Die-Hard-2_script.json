She already hates me because I'm not a \n[4]I can relate to that. Hate it myself-  Hey, that's a plastic fender, Jesus-  See, I used to be a New York cop still got my ID somewhere -I only moved 'cause my wife got promoted - look, maybe we can settle this right here, we're in Washington, heartbeat of Democracy, one hand washes the other He realizes the truck is DRIVING AWAY one way while the cop is i going off the other way - McClane votes for the cop - \n[5]Hey, c'mon, it's Christmas - \n[6]You son of a - BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat, finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into the terminal. \n[7]Ho - ho - ho... thru OMITTED thru \n[8]Hello. This is Lieutenant McClane - Somebody there beep me? \n[9]Holly! Did you land? \n[10]As far as I'm concerned, progress peaked with the frozen pizza. \n[11]Just speeding on sugar, thanks to your parents. I really appreciate you coming a day late, honey. Nothing I like better than a weekend with the Munsters. \n[12]No... not yet. Uh...how 'bout if when you land, we don't drive over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house, but check into the Airport motel? \n[13]You and me both, pal. The hell with it. Now it's Stuart's turn to look at McClane oddly; then he moves off. McClane looks after him, trying to place him... shrugs... heads for the bar. \n[14]Excuse me, officers. This may be a total wild goose chase, but I think I just saw - He STOPS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. The cop he's talking to is the asshole who towed away the car. \n[15]Elvis. McClane turns, throws money near his glass and quickly exits the bar. \n[16]Open this.  Got a cop on duty around here? \n[17]Get 'em. \n[18]This is a restricted area. You boys too impatient to wait for the skycaps? \n[19]Brilliant, asshole. I'm a cop -that was the bad guy! ' \n[20]Cleveland? \n[21]Whoa, wait a second. This is a crime scene. Aren't you going to seal off this area? \n[22]Up to the Captain? Take me up to the Captain, too. \n[23]Lorenzo? \n[24]I'm the one who - \n[25]No. Just a little professional courtesy. \n[26]Okay. Forget the courtesy. How about lust the professional? Your boys dust walked away from a crime scene - you need to seal it off, get a forensics team in, dust it, shoot \n[27]You store them somewhere - \n[28]Luggage? That \"punk\" pulled a Glock Seven on me. Know what that is? A porcelain gun from Germany. It doesn't show up on airport x-ray machines... and it costs more than you earn in a month. \n[29]If it's more than a dollar eighty nine, yeah - \n[30]One question, Carmine: Which sets off the metal detectors first: The shit in your brains, or the lead in your ass? \n[31]Excuse me. He reaches over, gently takes typing paper and a stamp pad. \n[32]Whoa, guys. (ver quickly showing \n[33]Didn't you ever have an airport stiff \n[34]Yup, he's dead,. all right. Thanks. And he's gone as they look after him, puzzled. \n[35]Excuse me, honey - can I borrow your office for a minute? Before she can answer, he's over the counter and reaching for her phone. \n[36]Hey, partner. Get that twinky out of your mouth and grab a pencil. \n[37]Vacation? Holly stood me up for a last minute meeting. I'm alone in DC with the in-laws. \n[38]R' ht. Listen, Al, what's our FAX n u mber in the station there? \n[39]Yeah, well my wife's company makes 'em, I figure it's time to get one of them pregnant.  This way? This way. The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at Powell's office. \n[40]From a stiff down here at Dulles. I marked the whorls with a pen in case the transmission's fuzzy. Can you run that through State and Federal for me - throw in Interpol if you got it. \n[41]I don't know. Just a feeling. \n[42]The FAX number is uh - \n[43]-on the top edge of your transmission. \n[44]Break out the chlorine. \n[45]Al? \n[46]What can you tell me? \n[47]You needed a computer for that? \n[48]What? \n[49]Yeah, I see it. Thanks a lot, Al. I owe you. He hangs up. The girl gives him the eye. \n[50]Just the FAX,, ma'am. Just the FAX. \n[51]Depends who you are. \n[52]Yeah. Now he's on the Network interviewing Transsexual Gum Surgeons and laughing all the way to the bank. \n[53]Nah. I do needlepoint. And he's at the end of the walkway and he quickly disappears into the crowd, leaving Sam pissed, puzzled... and out of breath. \n[54]I'm a police officer, Mr. Trudeau- \n[55]I think something serious is going to happen here tonight - \n[56]Anybody try and fix the deck tonight?  Anything weird going on besides the shooting? \n[57]What's that? \n[58]Okay. You clot back-up - back-up for everything you think can go wrong. What about something nobody anticipated? Not accidents, not \n[59]Damned straight the human element. You've got the world's biggest drug dealer on the way, one body and a'- lot of questionsl Doesn't anyone want to look for answers? \n[60]Jesus... \n[61]This? This ain't it, pal. This is just the beginning. A PHONE RINGS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. It's a prominent RED PHONE. \n[62]Maybe they don't. Maybe... it's them. \n[63]Esperanza? Trudeau nods - \n[64]What's all that about? \n[65]Meaning they pull Esperanza off his plane and take him anywhere there's no extradition treaties. \n[66]About time, Carmine. Guess you have to light a fire under your ass to light a fire under your ass. \n[67]Monday morning? My wife's on one of those planes these aasstards are fucking with! That makes me a player on the fucking field, you putz! And if you got off your fat ass when I told you to, maybe we wouldn't be knee deep in shit right now! \n[68]Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing with pros? You can't fuck with these \n[69]Anything you can think-of, they'll think of, too! But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie. \n[70]Shit! \n[71]\n[72]Stuart! The guy who got canned by Congress - that's who he was- \n[73]I don't believe this... another fucking elevator... another fucking basement... why does this always happen to me? He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC. Moves towards it. And arrives in - \n[74]Who the fuck are you? In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls. \n[75]You're what, the janitor? \n[76]Yeah. Just like you're not supposed to be living here. \n[77]Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out? \n[78]I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married? \n[79]My wife may be in some trouble upstairs. I gotta find out. This set up of yours? I won't tell a soul... provided you patch me into this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the tower. What do you say? \n[80]Christ. They're gonna try something cute... where's this annex skywalk? \n[81]Shit, it's a fucking bottleneck. Anybody smart enough to shut down the airport is smart enough to figure this... it's a perfect place for an ambush... \n[82]Tunnels. \n[83]Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy jog. \n[84]Whoa. \n[85]I owe you one, Marvin. How about a sixpack of malt liquor? \n[86]Oh, fuck \n[87]You okay?. \n[88]Bait. Something to jerk you off, make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men, and make you waste time. \n[89]Time you don't have... Time they don't have. \n[90]What...? \n[91]So are you. Break the code - \n[92]There's five dead officers here, Colonel Stuart - Isn't that penalty enough? \n[93]Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous for five minutes. Saw you get shit canned by Congress on TV. How much drug money is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor? \n[94]And lesson one starts with killing policemen? What's lesson two - the Neutron bomb? \n[95]Whatever the fuck I can, Barnes... whatever the fuck I can. \n[96]No... no, Jesus, Mary, Mother of God, \n[97]Relax, pal, I'm not a survivor. I'm just another victim. He grabs the rescue worker by the collar. \n[98].the last fucking victim he'll ever have. \n[99]Trudeau... I... I... \n[100]Do you? Do you? I've been a cop 13 years... Everything from... lost kids to hostages... but... all of it was... taking care of business... taking care of peoplle... until tonight. Tonight, everything I did, everything I tried... I never felt so useless. \n[101]And...? \n[102]This is it? A dozen men? Pause. Grant stops, looks at him. \n[103]John McClane. \n[104]Unfortunately the pros are on the other side. Colonel Stuart is one of your boys - \n[105]Yeah. But what if he took some night courses? Grant REACTS, recovers. \n[106]Trudeau.  Did things just get better... or worse? \n[107]That's all we keep hearing. Can you do anything with it? \n[108]My wife has less than two. \n[109]Except Colonel Stuart? The kid can't answer. Then Grant appears, the MAN from the Justice Department in tow. \n[110]They kind of busted me down to buck private. \n[111]The lining's ripped and it needs some invisible mending. Keep it. Think you can get me on line upstairs again? Marvin chuckles, moves over to a table and pulls aside a cloth. All electronic stuff there. \n[112]The code... the code's still punched... where did you get this? \n[113]How about I let you live? \n[114]Marvin... you show me a shortcut to runway fifteen and you got yourself a liner for that coat. \n[115]Eleven West? What the fuck happened to fifteen?  ;up to my ass in fucking terrorists again. I gotta start reading my Goddamn horoscope... \n[116]Not if I can help it, asshole. \n[117]Come to poppa, you son-of-a-bitch- He flies up the ladder - and BRUISES his shoulder against the locked grid. \n[118]Shit! \n[119]Thought you'd pull this off, didn't you? I guess you didn't count on me being here. Actually, I didn't count on me being here. \n[120]Just a cop who's spent half his career busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers. Looks like it's business as usual. Think this will look good on my record? Suddenly BULLETS PING on the hatch inches from McClane's head. \n[121]\n[122]\n[123]Christ! He DROPS from frame. \n[124]Esperanza's down... but he's hurt. I killed one more man... that's six they've lost all together. \n[125]Last I heard, they can't do that again. And if I grabbed Esperanza, the situation would be over. \n[126].The story of my life. But the enlisted men seem sympathetic. And so does \n[127]Stuart's guys? Yeah. That means they're on the field or close - \n[128]So - if they know this too - they could be sitting around the fireplace and hanging their fucking stockings in one of these houses? \n[129]Are you sure or not? \n[130]You didn't do that - you did your \n[131]Then how would you feel about a volunteer? \n[132]Hell. These people are hanging their Goddamn stockings. They DROP down into the snow, CRUNCH to the next fence. Look \n[133]- and these people aren't. r.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 55A NEW ANGLE 255A They've come to a corner; now they go back to the street, spread Barne's map out on the hood of Barne's still humming CAR. Far behind them, we SEE the illuminated airport TOWER, centered in the dark blot that should be brightly active runways. Barnes reaches inside his jacket, fumbles in his jammed plastic pocket thingie for a little flashlight. He checks the map. \n[134]Could be a sentry - \n[135]Then why is he going over his own footprints? \n[136]Stay here. Get ready to call the marines. \n[137]Who the fuck cares, just be ready. \n[138]I was wrong. You're not an asshole. \n[139]\n[140]Fuck... They're. pulling out!

Second clip - blanks CAMERA PUSHES in on McClane until he looks at the red/blue tape and -makes the connection. \n[144]Oh, my God... He gets. to his feet and RUNS. \n[145]Grant - the Terrorist Team -where are they? \n[146]They're not gonna do that -they're gonna get on the same Goddamn plane and leave with him! Before the Army canned him, Stuart must have loaded that unit with his own guys - \n[147]A side show to jerk us off - buy them \n[148]These are the bullets they used out there tonight. \n[149]Thanks; but I'm looking for a different kind of ride.

All REACT - McClane as much as anyone. \n[14]A plane is going to be landing at this Airport in 58 minutes. It is FM 1 - Foreign Military 1. \n[15]This plane is scheduled to be met by a continigent from the U.S. Justice-department. But now there will be a change of plans. This plane will not be met by anyone. It will land on a runway of my designation where it will not be molested. That will conclude my interest in that plane and your responsibility for it. At the same time, I want a 747 cargo conversion fully fueled. \n[16]I am doing this. \n[17]Except losing our own team wasn't part of the plan. He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the improvised screens and terminals. \n[18]Attention, Dulles. You were warned not to try and restore your systems. \n[19]McClave? John McClane? The... policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi hostages? I read about you in People magazine. You seemed out of your league on Nightline, though... \n[20]I think Cardinal Richlieu said it best: Treason is merely a matter of dates. And this country has to learn it can't keep cutting the legs off men. like General Esperanza -men with the guts to stand up to Soviet agression. \n[21]I think we can find something in between.  Give me a flight number - one low on fuel. Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to another mike . \n[22]Windsor flight one-four-teen, this is Dulles Approach... do you copy? \n[23]\n[24]Probably our runway systems coming back up. Don't worry about it you're coming in on instruments. \n[25]Looking good, Windsor... watch it - there's a 30 knot cross wind and the runway's icy - atta boy -atta \n[26]That concludes our object lesson for this evening. If the 747 we requested is ready on time and General Esperanza lands unmolested, further lessons can be avoided. \n[27]Don't worry, Captain. If this goes into extra innings... Well, we'll just call an our man in the other team's locker room. And - almost in afterthought - he wipes the flight number from the clear glass board. CAMERA PUSHES to the TELEVISION. \n[28]We've pussied out around the world, over and over again. We drop the Shah, fuck Marcos, throw Noriega overboard. You know what they think around the globe?

If there's another attempt to stop us like the one-you just made, I will fire several Stinger missiles into your terminal. Do I make myself clear? \n[43]Good. Please have a ground crew there to confirm the plane's condition. \n[44]Major Grant, .isn't it? \n[45]Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here. You have a green light.

Get your thumb out of your ass and get over to the elevator. Get them out and post a guard or you're gonna have a pink slip in your Christmas stocking!

Looks - \n[28]Lorenzo. Terminal Police. You want something... you got it. \n[29]Maybe if we knew how many they had to start with, we could get excited. But if they got fifty guys, it's a little early to break out the champagne. \n[30]You're where - you crazy idiot, why' didn't you - \n[31]McClane, what the hell do you think you're doing, playing John Wayne?

A radio beacon, that sends out this \"boop-boop-boop\" so they know they're over it, right? \n[26]So, who says that radio signal has to be just \"boop-boop boop\"? \n[27]-and we can talk to the planes and those bas ar s w o did this will never know! And as faces brighten for the first time in hours, we \n[28]-repeat, do not accept any instructions claiming to be from our tower unless you hear your own flight recorder access code. We will get this from your respective airlines and use it for confirmation. \n[29]What do we do? \n[30]McClane. You said they showed up there right away? \n[31]I think I know where. Interested, McClane'follows Barnes around the corner. \n[32]These are the old plans when the longer runways went in... that's twelve years ago. And it looks like they did some modifications on site... moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the underground stuff -so they could handle drainage. If I'm right, all of it would run along the edge of the airport property - and go right past this neighborhood. \n[33]Maybe. Yeah. Well, seventy eighty per cent, five percent either way- \n[34]I was sure about tying into the antenna array. And... and I got five officers killed. \n[35]I had a choice and I made it. But those cops didn't have a choice, and neither do those soldiers now. I'm an engineer, McClane. It's supposed to a wires and circuits... iron and steel. Not flesh and blood. Not lives. If...if I'm wrong again... I don't want anyone else to get orders that could get them killed. \n[36]Four more possibles. Three houses... and a church. They cross the intersection on foot, walk over a lawn. It's further to the next place; more prosperous yard.

What's your problem- Lieutenant McClane? \n[5]Hey. Something serious happens every night, only it doesn't make the newspapers. Ever see those guys on TV, juggling knives and cha n i saws? That's what we're doing with those planes up there, only we do it one handed 'cause the other hand's playing 3 card monte with the planes on the ground. \n[6]One way we manage the planes. But we've got backup - Long look from McClane. \n[7]The human element..? \n[8]Lorenzo. Have all your shift Commanders report in... now. \n[9]I want them to report anything out of the ordinary --no matter how trivial. You got that? \n[10]What is it? \n[11]\n[12]Shunt to another terminal! \n[13]We're on the same Goddamn grid and we're hot! Already the SPEAKER BOXES are beginning to CHATTER - \n[14]Jacoby, Strauss. Get your controllers on the horn - every plane approaching our Vortacs that's not in our pattern yet gets turned away'now. Everyone already inside our patrn holds at the outer marker. Stack 'em, pack 'em, and rack 'em. Move.  I want every off duty controller and technician here in five minutes. Page the terminal - no, better, beep them. McClane.

Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator. \n[19]Get what you need. Borrow, steal, kill. \n[20]Damn it, you can't do this -! \n[21]Put me on all bands... Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack from the ear/phone he wears and jacks it into a panel. \n[22]This is Dulles approach to all aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac. We are experiencing... Severe technical problems here. \n[23]Our NAV and Approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute.

He'll get himself killed - \n[29]Barnes. We have to warn those planes we got a lunatic down here who likes to pretend he's the tower. Get up to the cab and get us on the air. \n[30]With your Goddamn brain! Barnes leaves. McClane blinks, coming around to reality. Sees Trudeau. \n[31]You don't have to say anything, McClane. We all know how you feel. \n[32]Our own SWAT team's gone. We called the Government for help. They're sending in a special Army unit. Tactical Terrorist Team... McClane sees something else there in his eyes. \n[33]Your wife's plane...?  They keep broadcasting, even though we can't answer. They... they'll run out of fuel in 90 minutes.

But now that stewardess reaches up and turns on the TV PROJECTOR. As the lights DARKEN, Thornberg decides this is perfect cover. pretending he's getting a blanket overhead, he slips his credit card in one of airphones. Then he moves down the aisle, phone I inside his jacket. \n[20]I- I'm going to be sick - He makes a croaking noise to sell it, stumbles into the lavatory. \n[21]This is Richard Thornberg. Put me through to the News Director. I know he's getting ready for the broadcast, that's why I want him! Now get him or start typing your resume! \n[22]Well, none of them is me. You want proof?

What if they decide to crash another plane in retaliation for your little stunt? \n[7]Maybe they're more creative than you \n[8]Gentlemen. We have... a situation here... CLICK CLICK SNAP.

Now! \n[15]You're quite capable of confirming it yourself, Colonel.
