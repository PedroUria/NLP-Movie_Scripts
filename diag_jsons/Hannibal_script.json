Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids. \n[95]Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property. \n[96]Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources. \n[97]Due respect, sir... \n[98]Due respect, after your, after your... \n[99]Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. \n[100]...sir...? \n[101]Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings. \n[102]...will he be alright...? \n[103]What would that be? \n[104]Now, why in the world would he do that? \n[105]What reaction? \n[106]Please, I do not...

Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books. \n[149]And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. \n[150]Waal, because your selling'em...

I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know God? \n[12]Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life.
