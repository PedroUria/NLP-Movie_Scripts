{"dialogues": {"NORMAN": "\n[1]The zombie is eating her head, Grandma. \n[2]Because he's a zombie. That's what they do. \n[3]Coming, Dad! \n[4]Sex and violence. \n[5]I thought you said kids my age were too busy shoplifting and joyriding? \n[6]Dad? Grandma says, \"Can you turn up the heating?\" Her feet are cold. The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face, Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales. \n[7]I know! \n[8]Because she talks back! \n[9]I'm not making this up! I swear! She talks to me all the time! \n[10]She said it's not very ladylike to hide photos of the High School quarterback with his shirt off in your underwear drawer. Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows. \n[11]No I haven't! Grandma told me! \n[12]No she's not, she's in the living room. Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair. \n[13]Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late for school. I need to go. Hi, nice to see you guys. Good morning. Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me. Pardon me. See ya. At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper across the other side of the street. MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of raccoon road kill. \n[14]Hey there little buddy! C'mere! He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to face the onlooker, then hurries away. Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole host of ghosts are meandering through the streets. \n[15]Yeah, good to see you! How you doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look nice today. I like what you've done with your hair. \n[16]Totally. \n[17]Sir, yes sir! \n[18]No no, I'm just late for school. Sorry, I gotta go.  How you doin'? ParaNorman 8. \n[19]Hi! How's it hanging? \n[20]What do you want, Alvin? \n[21]Flies don't talk. Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy, but he is already being hurried along by his friend SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces. \n[22]The founding fathers of Blithe Hollow discovered an evil witch amongst them... \n[23]Sorry, Mrs Henscher. \n[24]I keep telling you, Neil. I like to be alone. \n[25]Why? \n[26]Doesn't it bother you? ParaNorman 14. \n[27]Yes. I know. I was told not to talk to you. Sorry. Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to Norman and whispering conspiratorially. \n[28]Actually, we're learning about it in school..? \n[29]He's my uncle. \n[30]What? Norman just stares at him. \n[31]Uh, yeah? \n[32]Maybe. \n[33]No. My grandma told me it's usually people who still have stuff to figure out. Or sometimes it's the ones who died suddenly, or in a bad way. A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly into two halves. \n[34]Bub? \n[35]Uh... good. Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby calves, then doubles back for another try. \n[36]He's happy to see you. \n[37]Yeah, I guess. Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making a \"coochy-coo\" face. \n[38]Uh... that's not his chin. Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up. Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him. \n[39]He can't fetch it, y'know. ParaNorman 19. \n[40]`Cos I don't really, uh... You can go. \n[41]No I don't want to. \n[42]No it's okay. You can throw it. \n[43]Here. You go first. \n[44]Okay, what do I do? \n[45]Neil? Sorry! As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth. \n[46]Are you okay? CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play, the sun above them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky. \n[47]Oh no! Not again! All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and through the darkness in the distance are occasional lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot looked three centuries ago. \n[48]No! \n[49]\n[50]\n[51]The tree told me! ParaNorman 24. \n[52]This is ridiculous. I wish everyone could see what I see! I didn't ask to be born this way! Perry mutters as he slams his door shut. \n[53]He's my dad. He shouldn't be afraid of me. ParaNorman 25. \n[54]You died?! \n[55]Ew! Couldn't you use another stall? \n[56]Me? No, you must have it wrong! \n[57]But I... I don't know what any of it means! ParaNorman 27. \n[58]But I'm just a kid! How am I supposed to stop it? In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten away, the school bathroom reappearing through the holes. \n[59]What book? \n[60]But this is crazy! \n[61]\n[62]Y-you mean like the \"f\" word? \n[63]Okay, okay, I promise... \n[64]No! Mr Prenderghast, wait! Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around the corner of his stall. \n[65]Wait! No, you can't leave now! Please! I don't understand. Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched up as he awaits his release, CACKLING crazily. The ghost explodes into a million particles of light, blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin backwards across the room. The mirrors behind him crack and the light bulb shatters. From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges. He reaches over and flushes the toilet. \n[66]Uh... yeah. You might want to give that a few minutes. He grabs his bag and runs out of the room. ParaNorman 29. \n[67]I've kinda got other things on my mind right now. Neil looks a little uncomfortable. \n[68]Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in the bathroom! \n[69]No, his spirit! He says the witch's curse is real and I have to go up to the old graveyard to stop it! Before the sun sets tonight! Neil shifts uneasily as he processes. \n[70]Didn't you hear what I just said?! \n[71]Just go home, Neil. I'm better off on my own anyway. \n[72]Go home! Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders sag and he turns away. Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls himself over the garden fence. \n[73]No one. Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion. \n[74]Dad says I'm not supposed to talk to you any more, Grandma. \n[75]So why did you stay? \n[76]So it's your... duty? \n[77]And you'd do it no matter what? \n[78]Even if it was something really scary... Grandma eyes him curiously. \n[79]Hello? Mr Prenderghast? Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself. He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken typewriters, a suspended bag of spoons, a closet full of identically soiled hobo suits, a Nordic track... \n[80]Let go! Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free. With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING, Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door. \n[81]This is it! The sun continues its descent, casting an ever lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard. \n[82]Read from the book, stop the curse, go home and pretend this never happened. Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read. \n[83]\"Once upon a time, in a far-off land there lived a king and queen in a magnificent castle...\" He pauses, confused by what he's reading. \n[84]What? A fairy... tale...? A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping the book out of his grasp. He spins around to find Alvin standing behind him. \n[85]Give it back! \n[86]No, don't! Alvin! \n[87]Uh-oh. \n[88]It's her! Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and the wind instantly cuts out. The boys stand stock still. Reaching down like a colossal arm, a great plume of cloud spirals over the cemetery, enveloping the tumbledown chapel and seeping around the gravestones. Fingers of murky fog slither across the ground, occasionally pausing and hanging in the air as though sniffing it. There is something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils. The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through the fog like a heartbeat. Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into the earth in front of the boys. ParaNorman 37. \n[89]Once upon a time in a far-off... Once upon a... In a... \n[90]It's not working! The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns, confused, because he can hear words. \n[91]Wait! Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones. \n[92]I think you'll be safe. \n[93]I don't get it! Why didn't it work? He opens the book and leafs through page after page of ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations. \n[94]\"The Story of Sleeping Beauty\". This doesn't make any sense! His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway. \n[95]Mr Prenderghast, I don't understand! Tell me what to do! \n[96]He told me to read from the book to stop the curse! I thought it was a spell or something, but... Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's desk, still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings. He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess, scattering papers across the floor. \n[97]Come on! There has to be something... \n[98]Seven victims... Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old book tacked to the wall. It is an illustration of a hideous old crone, cackling evilly. Another THUMP from down the hall. Norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to the image of the old witch. There's something he's not seeing... He looks at the pictures in front of him. Graves. Jurors. Witch. \n[99]Seven graves. The witch's grave! It wasn't there! He turns to Alvin. \n[100]I was reading the book in the wrong place! Down the hallway, another loud THUMP. \n[101]Hide! ParaNorman 43. \n[102]Come on! \n[103]Run! The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening its mouth. Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the road sits up and reaches out its arms. Mitch drop kicks it like a football. It flies, WAILING, into the bushes. ParaNorman 47. \n[104]Uh, guys... maybe we should actually drive away now. \n[105]Well, you weren't supposed to follow me, were you? \n[106]You don't understand! I'm the only one who can stop this, Courtney! \n[107]I'm supposed to read from the book at the witch's grave! \n[108]She wasn't buried with the others. I don't know where else to look... \n[109]Uh... yeah. \n[110]Salma! We need to find out where the witch is buried! I went to the old graveyard but her grave wasn't there! \n[111]Salma! Please! Hurry! Y'know, I would Google this myself if there wasn't a 300 year old dead guy trying to rip my face off! With a SIGH, Salma types at her computer. \n[112]Quick! She said go to the Town Hall! \n[113]Uh oh. C'mon! \n[114]Hurry! This way! Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem. Townsfolk fill the streets, SHOUTING and acting generally mob-like. One or two of them have even got hold of burning torches from somewhere. It's apocalyptic chaos. The fat woman from the Drive-Thru runs past SCREAMING, her face and T-shirt covered in blood-red ketchup. \n[115]C'mon! They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding flying bottles and limbs as best they can. Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of expressing horrified shock. After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face, turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby. The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away, rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances, then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered companions before running off into the shadows. Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint. \n[116]Is everyone alright? Nobody got bitten? Neil flops down heavily against the statue, panting and holding his mouth. \n[117]Does anyone know how to pick a lock? Everyone immediately looks at Alvin. \n[118]This is it! ParaNorman 61. \n[119]Now we can find out where the witch was buried! Norman pushes his shoulder against the door and steps inside. \n[120]Uh-oh. Courtney follows, faking enthusiasm. \n[121]Come on! No, that's not it. Time is running out! \n[122]If I'd known there was so much reading involved, I would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me. Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to him, hardly believing he might have found the answer. He waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at everyone. \n[123]Guys, come on! \n[124]We have to keep trying! ParaNorman 66. \n[125]You never listen! No one ever listens! I'm scared too, but I've still gotta do this. \n[126]I should've known you wouldn't understand! No one ever does! \n[127]Everyone in the real world thinks I'm a freak! And you know what, maybe they're right, maybe I am a freak! But I never asked for your help... just go! Get out! Courtney, Mitch and Alvin back off a half step as Norman advances on them. \n[128]Hello? He turns around to face his friend and finds himself staring up at a zombie, moving toward him along the dark aisle, pale moonlight shining off its exposed bones. Norman GASPS. He realizes zombies are converging on him from all directions, barring his way out through the door. The Dead Judge GROANS as he approaches. Norman backs away, clutching the book to his chest. Out of the corner of his eye Norman spots another doorway in the shadows of the wall behind him and moves toward it, calling out desperately. \n[129]Help! Somebody help me! \n[130]You horrible old witch! Is this what you want? The roiling face above him seems to CACKLE mercilessly. \n[131]Once upon a time in a far-off land there lived a king and queen... in a magnificent castle... The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously, drowning out the story. \n[132]Why won't you listen to me? Why are you doing this?! The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of lightning spits out. It SMACKS into the book held in front of Norman's chest, lifts him up off his feet and throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof. The air is knocked out of Norman as, trailing smoke, he SMASHES through the wood into the fiery chasm of the building beneath. ParaNorman 71. \n[133]No! A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds further ammunition to the prosecution. \n[134]Wait! No! You can't do this! The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She backs away, tears flowing down her face. \n[135]How could you?! She was just a little kid! She was no different than me! The Dead Judge takes a step forward. \n[136]Keep away from me! The Dead Judge stops, then opens his horrible mouth and speaks in a guttural voice. ParaNorman 74. \n[137]What? You don't want to kill me? The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book beside Norman's feet. \n[138]But it didn't work! It's a fairy tale! Just a bedtime... story... He narrows his eyes at the Judge. \n[139]That's it, isn't it? A bedtime story to keep a little girl asleep for another year. And now you need my help because I'm the only one who can read it to her! He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge. It hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD. \n[140]Here's your book! Try reading it yourself! The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred paper, and several of them GASP. The Dead Judge's eyes are filled with fear and desperation. \n[141]Why did you do it? \n[142]Of what? \n[143]Every year someone reads the story at her grave. Before me it was Mr Prenderghast, and before him there were others, but the curse doesn't ever go away. Nothing gets better. It's not enough. Norman looks at it a moment, thinking. He knows what he has to do. \n[144]Something nobody ever did before. I've gotta go talk to her. \n[145]Come on! This way! \n[146]Wait! Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from within the doorway. \n[147]No! I won't! Sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm. \n[148]No! You don't understand what's happening here! I spoke to them and it's not what you think! Courtney edges forward out of the doorway, shocked but transfixed. \n[149]The curse isn't about the zombies hurting you! It's about you hurting them! I figured it out, and I know a way to stop this! \n[150]Listen to me! \n[151]No, does it look like any of them are trying to hurt you? They're just people. At least they used to be. Just stupid people who should have known better. Norman looks at the line of Puritans. They look quite sad and pathetic really. Hardly monstrous at all. \n[152]They did something unforgivable because they were scared, and they were cursed for it. Now it's happening all over again. Don't you get it? They were just like you. But now it has to stop. For good. Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are starting to look a little guilty. There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the line of three hundred year-old townsfolk. Throughout the crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground. A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one of the zombies his arm back. The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a hellish wind. The street lamps around the square shatter in bursts of sparks, raining down on the amassed people. The sky above is blood red, clouds twisting and contorting into a vast unnatural vortex. The Town Hall erupts in a fireball, tongues of white fire ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the crowd scatters in terror. Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a parked car, and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind. \n[153]I... I really don't know... \n[154]But... \n[155]I thought we did. \n[156]Dad, could I borrow the car? \n[157]She wants you to move over. The Judge MUMBLES. \n[158]Can you quit using the \"z\" word? \n[159]He says \"take a left here\". Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering wheel. He peers out through the raging storm, windscreen wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris. \n[160]Turn down there! \n[161]Someone's gotta talk to her, Dad. \n[162]Mom! \n[163]I'm okay Mom! Wait for me here! Don't worry! \n[164]Hello? Words echo around him in response. \n[165]Uh... I really need to speak with you. \n[166]I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You don't actually know me, but I know you. We're actually kind of the same, you and I. Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind. ParaNorman 85. \n[167]Well, no, apart from that. \n[168]Well, yes, that too. \n[169]Well, I know how you feel? \n[170]I know your name is Agatha Prenderghast. The ghostly voice wavers for the first time. \n[171]And I know you're probably tired. Right? Because, I mean, it's really late and it's been a long night and we're, like, only eleven years-old, and... The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder. \n[172]No. I'm not leaving. Just listen to me.  Uh... once upon a time... long ago... there was a little girl... ParaNorman 86. \n[173]A little girl who was different from the other people in her village. The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its demonic fingers in its ears. \n[174]She could see and do things that no one could understand, and that made them scared of her. \n[175]She turned away from everyone, and became sad and lonely, and had no one to turn to. \n[176]But the more she turned away from people, the more scared they were of her, and they did something terrible! Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they hit the ground, they send up white flames. \n[177]They became so scared that they took her away and killed her! \n[178]But even though she was dead something in her came back. \n[179]And this part of her wouldn't go away, not for three hundred years... \n[180]And the longer it stayed, the less there was of the little girl! \n[181]Why? Aggie goes to shout, but stops, unsure of her answer. \n[182]Because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are! So whenever you wake up you play this mean game, but you don't play fair! \n[183]So you hurt them back? \n[184]You're just like them, Agatha. \n[185]You're a bully. \n[186]They did something awful, but that doesn't mean you should too! ParaNorman 88. \n[187]All that's left of you now is mean and horrible! He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the ground, and her hair is writhing madly about her, and plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body, but she's still just a little girl underneath. \n[188]Then stop. This is wrong and you know it! You've spent so long remembering the bad people that you've forgotten the good ones. There must have been someone who loved you and cared for you. You don't remember them? \n[189]But you're not alone! You have to remember! \n[190]Remember! There is a flash of white, and silence. \n[191]Sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things. I think you got so scared, that you forgot who you are. But I don't think you're a witch. Not really. Aggie looks into his eyes. \n[192]I think you're just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her. He smiles softly. \n[193]So we're not all that different at all. \n[194]Well, yeah, but what good would that do? You think just because there's bad people out there that there's no good ones either? I thought the same thing. ParaNorman 90. \n[195]For a while. But there's always someone out there for you. Somewhere. Aggie frowns, looking lost. \n[196]I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone. \n[197]I think that's up to you. Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet. \n[198]It's a pretty good place to sleep. Then you can be with your mom again. Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground, her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands. Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes. Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny frame shifting softly under her long hair. The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie softens as though out of focus, and the whole world becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up into the clouds high above his head. Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES softly through the sky, as if moving away. \n[199]Sleep tight. He clambers down through the roots back toward the path. \n[200]Mom, you're embarrassing me. \n[201]Hey Neil. He climbs up beside his friend, who beams at him gleefully. \n[202]I guess. I just wanted to say thanks. You stood by me. All the time. \n[203]As normal as it could be. \n[204]Hi Dad. \n[205]A scary movie. ", "NEIL": "\n[1]Ooh! This is my moment! He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around, not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around Norman's neck. Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on stage. The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER. ParaNorman 13. \n[2]Sorry! Mrs Henscher flings her script into the air, her face beet red. \n[3]Norman, wait up! \n[4]So do I. Let's do it together! You shouldn't let them get you down. They always do stuff like that to me. \n[5]Because I'm fat. And my allergies make my eyes leak. And I sweat when I walk too fast. And I have a lunchbox with a kitten on it. And I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I guess there's a whole bunch of stuff. \n[6]Nah. You can't stop bullying, it's part of human nature. If you were bigger and more stupid, you'd probably be a bully too. It's called \"survival of the thickest\". \n[7]That statue just \"pissst\" at us! Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of them, startling them as he staggers closer. \n[8]The weird stinky old bum who lives up the hill? \n[9]I'm a tree! Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and leans close to Norman. \n[10]Leave him alone! An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition. \n[11]Don't make me throw this hummus! It's spicy! Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the scene. He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman. ParaNorman 16. \n[12]Jeez, what a dirty old creep! \n[13]So is it true? \n[14]Can you see ghosts? Like, everywhere? All the time? \n[15]Awesome! Do you think you can see my dog Bub? He was run over by an animal rescue van. Tragic and ironic. We buried him in the yard. Could you see him? Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback. \n[16]Sweet! Come on! \n[17]Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play with the dead dog in the garden and we're not even gonna have to dig him up first! Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round flip-flops. \n[18]Can you stop doing that? It's kinda stupid. \n[19]Don't blow this for me, Mitch. This one's not weird. He talks to dead people. Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his brother. \n[20]He's around here somewhere... So does everyone come back as a ghost? ParaNorman 18. \n[21]Is he there? How's he look? Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs behind to sniff his own backside. \n[22]Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy! Can he feel it if I pet him? \n[23]Go get it! \n[24]Yeah well, it's still fun. Good boy! Bring it back! Go get it, Bub! Good boy! CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his feet and he bends down to pick it up. \n[25]Why don't you try? \n[26]No, no, it's fun! Try it! \n[27]You throw it. It's really easy. \n[28]No, c'mon, it's really fun. \n[29]No, you try it. I already went like fifty times. \n[30]You get the stick, you pull it back, and you throw it! Norman throws it and accidentally hits Neil in the head, knocking him over. \n[31]I fetched it! ParaNorman 20. \n[32]What? \n[33]Hey buddy! Are you okay? Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS. \n[34]Norman? Alvin tears around the corner in pursuit, but Neil stands in his way, waving his arms indignantly. \n[35]Hey! What's the big deal? \n[36]Or what? \n[37]I don't have boobs. These are pectorals! Alvin jabs him in the chest. \n[38]Ow! My boobs! Neil swiftly steps aside. Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along the path as fast as he can. Alvin YELLS after him. \n[39]You wanna play some hockey? Norman SIGHS. \n[40]Is it all that walking dead stuff again? \n[41]Ew. ParaNorman 31. \n[42]So you wanna come play a bit later? \n[43]Yeah, but I thought my idea was less likely to get us eaten. Norman knows he's on his own in this. \n[44]But... \n[45]I'm busy! \n[46]No! The doorbell RINGS again. \n[47]Neil? \n[48]Oh no... ...idea! I have no idea where he is. Sorry. Bye! Neil goes to turn around but his brother stops him short. \n[49]I didn't really think he was serious about going up to the old graveyard on his own! \n[50]I don't know. Maybe we should go look for him. \n[51]Uh, is Norman in trouble? \n[52]Kill me now. \n[53]He is your brother. Courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely, but Mitch's attention has been drawn by something else. \n[54]Look out! Mitch slams on the breaks, twisting the wheel. \n[55]That was Norman! Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of the darkness in front of them. He slams on the brakes again, but too late. The tall dirty-looking figure stands stock still as the van plows straight into him. Dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to an eventual stop in the center of the road. \n[56]Sorry. My fault. When I'm nervous I get mouth diarrhoea. \n[57]Whaddawedo? Whaddawedo? Mitch?! \n[58]You're the oldest! \n[59]We've got to go back to the graveyard? \n[60]I have an idea! ParaNorman 51. \n[61]Oh yeah! Neil HUMS his very own action movie score as he runs to follow Norman out of the parking lot. ParaNorman 57. \n[62]I bid dy tongue! Dud dat count? Norman moves toward the steps leading up to the Town Hall's doors, the rest of the gang falling into line behind him. Another flash of lightning paints the kids' shadows across the width of the square. Norman nervously watches the clouds above them. \n[63]This is? \n[64]This'll be a piece of cake, you'll see. He pauses, and frowns, squinting up his eyes as he reads aloud, very slowly. \n[65]Page... One... Okay, page one. Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He seems to read the filing notes written across its front, then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell. ParaNorman 62. \n[66]Yes! Book number one! Finished! That is right, twenty six pages, oh yeah! Everyone GROANS and turns back to their bickering. ParaNorman 65. \n[67]I'm not going anywhere. You can't make me. Mitch shrugs and picks his brother up, scooping him under one arm and carrying him out the door. \n[68]I'm not speaking to you. You can't make me. Norman watches the doors shut behind them, and his anger begins to ebb. Alone in the archive room, he slumps to his knees feeling useless and frustrated. \n[69]All night he's been trying to save you from the witch's curse! \n[70]Jeez, what is her problem? Norman takes in the chaos around them... ParaNorman 80. \n[71]So what do we do now? \n[72]You did it! You stopped the witch's curse and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything! \n[73]Yeah, of course. Don't get weird or anything. So you think now everything's gonna turn back to normal? Norman looks across the square. The smoldering buildings, the fallen signposts, the warped trees, the rubble... ", "COURTNEY": "\n[1]Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d. Like, a seven pack at least. Ew! Watch it! She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the garbage outside. \n[2]Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve him. I mean, she's nice and I really like her, but she's a complete loser. Yeah, I know. Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger. Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a moment as if thinking something over. \n[3]O-M-G, you are such a liar! ParaNorman 4. \n[4]Oh yeah? Prove it! Norman levels her a look that says \"you asked for this\". \n[5]I knew it! You've been sneaking around in my personal stuff! \n[6]You are the worst! Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her. Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily sympathetic smile. \n[7]So I said to her, \"Girl, come back and talk to me when your basket toss gets twelve thousand hits on YouTube!\" Yeah, no, I said that.  Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol. Tonight's gonna be a total yawn. From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her hand over the phone and shouts out. \n[8]Norman?! \n[9]You better not be sneaking out you little weirdo! \n[10]I'm gonna kill them. She impatiently leans down to push open the mail slot. \n[11]I know you're in there! Slumber party's over, dorks! The door opens and she finds herself face to navel with Mitch, out of the shower with a towel around his waist. ParaNorman 39. \n[12]Hell yeah. Courtney catches herself and quickly affects a LAUGH. \n[13]Sorry to bug you so late, but does, erm...  ...Neil live here? \n[14]Oh wow! That's great! Your brother and my brother are like best friends! I'm Courtney. She tries to regain her composure as Mitch turns away. \n[15]Hey there! How ya doin'... little guy... \n[16]Yeah, Neil. Do you know where Norman is? He kinda disappeared. \n[17]So Norman! \n[18]No, it's fine. He sucks. But I really gotta make sure he doesn't die or anything tonight. Will you help me? Please? Mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act, then SIGHS. \n[19]And she said I could totally consider a career in formation swimming. But I was like, \"I wanna do something that helps people less fortunate than me\", thank you very much, y'know, like the poor or people who are like dying or ugly or something, `cuz I really think that ecology and world peace are like totally important today. Do you use free weights? Your deltoids are huge. \n[20]Thank you for doing this Mitch. He means an awful lot to me. I love him like he was a brother. \n[21]Is he dead or what? \n[22]So he's okay? \n[23]What? What did you just say? Mitch looks from the head back to the van, then at the head again. He licks his lips nervously as he thinks. \n[24]That was insane! \n[25]Norman, what just happened?! \n[26]Sorry, who are you? \n[27]I just knew something like this was going to happen tonight! \n[28]Why d'you have to go and get everyone involved in all your weird stuff?! \n[29]Oh my gosh, I think I'm having an aneurism! This is so typical of you! \n[30]Oh, I understand! I understand that this is all getting completely out of... The van's sunroof is suddenly ripped open, and the Dead Judge's arm reaches down into the vehicle, clawing inches above Courtney's head. \n[31]\n[32]Norman! How do we stop them?! Norman looks again at the book in his hands. \n[33]Well you better think of something quick! Norman wracks his brain. \n[34]Mitch, do something! Mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers, which wipe the zombie's rotten flesh from side to side across the glass. Mitch and Courtney's eyes follow the Judge's movements from side to side. ParaNorman 52. \n[35]Oh, I broke a nail! As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's arm, as if it were a dead animal, and dangles it limply in front of his face. \n[36]Perfect. Now the geeks are in charge. The kids make toward the parking lot exit. \n[37]Oh, this is awful! The zombies are, like, eating everyone! Norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the Old Town Hall in the plaza. \n[38]Great! I'm super psyched! This is turning into the most fun night ever! The overhead light clicks on as Alvin steps into the room behind her and GROANS. \n[39]We're not going to find it in here, Norman! This is useless! \n[40]I can't believe this is your plan! I'm gonna get bitten and start eating peoples' brains! I'm supposed to be Vegan! Mitch suddenly SHOUTS out from the doorway. \n[41]We tried and look what happened! I'm scared, Norman, and I can't listen to this any more. Norman looks at the faces in front of him. The kids are scared and confused and angry. Even Neil has nothing encouraging to offer. Norman's brow furrows. \n[42]I do too listen! And whatever it was you just said, it's not working! You think you're going to go out there and do your talking to the dead thing and this is all going to be okay? What are you going to do, ask the zombies not to eat you? \n[43]Norman, you need to stop all this weird stuff and start living in the real world! \n[44]C'mon! ParaNorman 67. \n[45]Um, excuse me? Hello? Unmistakably living hands and arms suddenly SMASH through the barricade, clawing into the Town Hall. The kids recoil from the windows, SCREAMING as they bat ineffectually at the grasping hands. \n[46]We're all gonna DIE! \n[47]Mitch, if we die tonight, this might be the last chance I get to tell you how I feel. ParaNorman 76. \n[48]Norman? \n[49]You've gotta be kidding me... Norman, his mouth shielded by his sleeve, heads purposefully toward the front doors. \n[50]Leave him alone! Courtney suddenly emerges, standing right in front of Norman. Following her lead in true \"I'm Spartacus!\" fashion, Neil, Mitch and Alvin step forward too, creating a barrier all around him, all joining hands in solidarity. CLOSE ON Courtney's face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin. \n[51]Hand, Alvin! My hand! A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd. \n[52]Everybody, listen up! You all need to stop trying to kill my brother! You're adults! Stop it! I know that this seems crazy, believe me I'm with you on that, but I think he does actually know what he's talking about! \n[53]Yes you do, Norman! You've got to get to that witch's grave! \n[54]But nothing! You listen to me, buster, we didn't turn away when Daleridge High was slaughtering our volleyball team, did we? \n[55]No we didn't. I've cheered the uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not letting you give up now! Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business. \n[56]Norman! He's on my side of the seat! \n[57]I heard that! Mom! Tell the zombie to stop saying stuff about me! \n[58]Good job, Norman. Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes. \n[59]So I was thinking, maybe we could catch a movie sometime? Nothing scary. ", "MITCH": "\n[1]Neil? That you? ParaNorman 17. \n[2]What'd you say? Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman, who stands awkwardly a little way away, surrounded by cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary. \n[3]Neil, isn't he that weird kid? Y'know, \"Look at me, I talk to ghosts so people will pay attention to me.\" Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically. \n[4]Now listen to me, you don't need to be hanging out with weird people. That's a tip. Neil scowls at his brother. \n[5]Did he say the dead are coming? \n[6]Neil! Will you get the door? \n[7]Are you freeze-framing Mom's aerobics DVD again? ANGLE ON TV, with a still image of a Lycra-clad instructor bending over. Neil quickly turns it off. \n[8]Neil! Would it kill you to get off your butt and answer the door? \n[9]Um, can I help you? \n[10]Yeah, he's my brother. \n[11]Hey Neil! You come here a minute? There's a girl asking for you. Neil's face emerges dubiously from a room down the hall. Courtney flashes her widest fake grin and puts on a high pitched sing-song voice. \n[12]Whoa, Neil! Better start talking, buddy. ParaNorman 40. \n[13]Oh, man. That place is bad news! Total slasher movie vibe! Why'd he go up there? \n[14]I told you he was trouble. Sorry. But I did. \n[15]Okay... I guess I should go get some clothes on. Courtney gives a disappointed WHINE as he heads off down the hall, shoving Neil's head as he goes. \n[16]I've never used deltoids in my life, I swear. You can test me. Neil lies back in his seat, eyes rolling. \n[17]Whoa! Look at that sky! ParaNorman 45. \n[18]Oh no! \n[19]Is everyone okay? Courtney and Neil answer in unison, both of them upside down in their seats with their legs sticking up in the air. \n[20]Er... hello, sir? He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench. A mud-encrusted face stares up at him. ANGLE ON the van, as Courtney leans her head out. \n[21]I... I don't know! He's not moving! The figure's head lets out a faint GASP. \n[22]He's still breathing! Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figure's head but as he does, there is a CRUNCH and it comes off in his hands. \n[23]Uh... not exactly. \n[24]Does anyone know CPR? Further down the road, Norman runs back toward the van, Alvin still in tow. He sees Mitch ahead of him, getting dizzily to his feet, still holding the head. \n[25]Did you see that? \n[26]I know, right? I kicked that like a hundred yards! \n[27]Oh, right. ParaNorman 48. \n[28]You did? Wow, `cos that zombie bit really threw me. Courtney turns in her seat and glares at her brother. \n[29]I don't know! I don't know! \n[30]Not mentally! Mitch hears a SIREN wail out behind him, and looks in his mirror to see the flashing light of Hooper's bike. \n[31]Oh great. The cops. Hooper pulls level with the passenger seat window, waving angrily. \n[32]Oh my gosh! I'm gonna be sick! \n[33]Baby, I'm so sorry. You'll be alright. We're gonna get through this together. Courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words aren't for her. Norman looks up at the sky. A thick bank of cloud looms over the town, and in its center is the unmistakable otherworldly face, ebbing in and out of visibility, and grinning horribly. \n[34]I really hate these places. Norman sizes up the masses of documents all around them, face panicked. It would take days to go through them all. \n[35]I thought I was driving the van. No one told me I was gonna have to do this other dumb stuff. \n[36]Guys! There's something moving out there! I think it's the zombies! \n[37]Oh, no it's not. It's just grown- ups. \n[38]That sound. Y'know what that is? That's not awesome... things... \n[39]Jeez, that was dramatic. Courtney shoots him a look as if she's about to fight back, then shakes her head and shoves her way through the door. She turns to go, snapping at the other kids behind her. \n[40]Dude, you're really heavy. \n[41]Guys! Guys! Under here! Under here! The kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as more glowing embers rain down around them. Courtney grabs Mitch by the bicep and whispers weakly. \n[42]Uh, well, no. Unless we get brought back as zombies, and then technically you'll have longer. Courtney opens her mouth to continue, but her love train is thoroughly derailed by the nearby CRASH of breaking wood, and the archive door beside them CLATTERS to the ground. The cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several dark figures limp and shamble out of the smoke and make their way past them across the room. It's the zombies, and they're being led by Norman. \n[43]Yeah, and all you want to do is burn and murder stuff, burn and murder stuff! Just burning and murdering! ParaNorman 79. \n[44]That sounds great, Kathy! Y'know, you're gonna love my boyfriend! He's like a total chick-flick nut! Courtney stares at him, at a loss for words, then successfully reads between the lines and turns away ", "PERRY BABCOCK": "\n[1]Norman! Didn't I tell you to take out the garbage? \n[2]Can't you be like other kids your age and pitch a tent in the yard, or have a healthy interest in carpentry? \n[3]How many times do we have to go through this, Son? Your grandmother is dead! \n[4]Then why do you keep on talking to her? \n[5]Your grandmother was old and sick, and she died. That's all there is to it! \n[6]Stop indulging him! I'm nothing if I'm not liberal, but that limp- wristed, hippie garbage needs to be nipped in the bud! Norman SIGHS and steps between his parents as they argue. He mutely heads out of the room. \n[7]This behavior might be okay with your side of the family, but I'm not putting up with it anymore! Not me! \n[8]This isn't the West Coast, Sandra; people talk! They do! \n[9]Oh please, \"sensitive\" is writing poetry and being lousy at team sports... not this! I won't have him turn out like that uncle of yours! If that crazy old tramp has been around here putting ideas in Norman's head... \n[10]Great, now we'll never get to remember this moment. ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her hands theatrically at the other children. \n[11]No, no, no! \n[12]This is where it stops! It's one thing being a mental case in front of your family, but not the whole freaking town! There's not gonna be any more talking to ghosts, or grandmas, or, or... what is it now? \n[13]You're grounded! You hear me? Perry pulls the car up in the Babcock's drive and gruffly climbs out of the car. \n[14]Funny, neither did we. Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut. His mother hears it too, and leans over her seat with a look of sympathy. A beat as she sees the pain in her son's face. \n[15]I really don't think we should be leaving him. \n[16]He's probably up there right now fiddling with his ouija, or his orbs, or whatever it is he's got up there. This is not good. \n[17]I don't want to. \n[18]I have no idea what you're talking about. Seriously, where did you learn that? \n[19]Delinquent drivers! Where are the police when you need them? Hooper's bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the hood of the station wagon with a CRUNCH. Before Perry can react he is buried under the mass of Sheriff Hooper, dropping like a meteorite onto his head. \n[20]Of course not! He is interrupted by a SHOUT as someone sees Norman's tiny figure silhouetted against the raging sky on the roof of the building. \n[21]Norman! Get down from there this instant! You're supposed to be grounded! ParaNorman 70. \n[22]Son! Step away from the zombies! \n[23]I'll come back and haunt Norman! Maybe then he'll start listening to me! \n[24]Excuse me? ParaNorman 81. \n[25]So help me I will stop this car right now if all three of you don't quit it this instant! ParaNorman 82. \n[26]We've already been this way. We're going around in circles! \n[27]Oh, right, you think maybe we should stop at a graveyard and dig up some other eighteenth-century corpses? \n[28]I wish I understood you. \n[29]Please don't tell me he needs to use the bathroom. Norman listens as the Judge continues GRUMBLING, then leans forward over his father's seat, pointing. \n[30]So, why are we here? \n[31]Yeah, um, why's that person you, exactly? As they continue, the surrounding trees press in on them, just like in Norman's vision. Branches and thorns lash at their faces while thick roots entangle their feet. Norman's family are falling behind and realize too late that the encroaching trees are about to crush Norman. \n[32]I'm trying! \n[33]Well done, Son. You did it. The Judge, stood some way behind them, lets out a GROAN, and the Babcocks turn to look at him. ParaNorman 92. \n[34]Son. \n[35]What're you watching? \n[36]Your, uh, your grandma here is she? Norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother sitting side by side on the sofa. He nods. \n[37]Right. Of course she is. Perry tries his best to maintain his composure, and wriggles a little in his seat. \n[38]Is she... Is she sitting next to me? Norman nods. Perry \"hem-hems\" and turns awkwardly to face her, nose to ear. She doesn't seem to notice. \n[39]Hi Mom. Perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to concentrate on the movie his son is watching. Sandra and Courtney enter from the kitchen carrying snacks. Sandra takes a seat on an armchair and Courtney lies down on the floor beside her brother, munching popcorn. They all settle in to watch the movie. A beat, then Perry and Grandma speak at the same time. ", "SANDRA BABCOCK": "\n[1]Hi. Whatcha watching in there? \n[2]Oh. That's nice. Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage. \n[3]Perry... \n[4]Norman! He hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot. ParaNorman 3. \n[5]Courtney, be nice. \n[6]Now, Perry... \n[7]Norman, I know you and Grandma were very close, but we all have to move on. Grandma's in a better place now. \n[8]Perry, this is just part of the mourning process. ParaNorman 5. \n[9]Oh, not this again! PAN UP to find a light go on in Norman's bedroom window. \n[10]He's just sensitive, Perry. \n[11]Perry, no one's had anything to do with Uncle Prenderghast in years! I bet he doesn't even know what Norman looks like! Norman quietly closes the door, and the room goes black. ParaNorman 6. \n[12]Gosh, aren't they adorable? Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams of the gymnasium. Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS. ParaNorman 22. \n[13]Norman! \n[14]I think it's trees. \n[15]Y'know, sometimes people say things that seem mean, but they do it because they're afraid. \n[16]He's not afraid of you. He's afraid for you. Sadly, Norman climbs out of the car. \n[17]Perry, you promised me a meal that someone else microwaved. ParaNorman 30. \n[18]I really think it might help if you tried to see things from his point of view. \n[19]Perry, not believing in the Afterlife is like not believing in Astrology. \n[20]Calm down. Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS. \n[21]Oh my gosh, do you think this has got anything to do with Norman? Perry waves her hand away irritably. \n[22]Perry, do something! He cups his hands around his mouth and YELLS at Norman. \n[23]Norman! Perry feels the shift in the crowd. They're not just baying for blood. They're about to start baying for his son's blood. \n[24]Oh my gosh! Far above, the clouds THUNDER like demonic laughter. Perry steps forward, face red. \n[25]Perry, calm down! You're going to have a heart attack and then what are you going to do? \n[26]Can you stop being a mob for just one minute?! \n[27]Oh, Norman! \n[28]Boy, the traffic tonight! \n[29]Maybe we should pull over and ask someone? \n[30]It's not a bad idea. \n[31]Oh my, do you think that's it? ParaNorman 83. \n[32]Oh my goodness, look out! \n[33]Perry! Do something! Perry is finding it difficult to move; a tree bears down on him, its roots snagging his thrashing limbs. \n[34]Kick it in the knothole! Norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they SMASH together, blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood. Sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches. \n[35]Norman?! ParaNorman 84. \n[36]Be careful! Now separated from the others, Norman turns to go ahead on his own. Ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off the trees, and he knows he is very close. \n[37]Norman? Norman! Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms, hugging him tightly. \n[38]My brave little man! I thought I was going to lose you! \n[39]That's my job. ", "ALVIN": "\n[1]Hey, ghost jerk! You know what? Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom wears a T-shirt emblazoned with \"TEAM ALVIN\". Norman SIGHS. \n[2]Why don't you see some more ghosts, goober? ParaNorman 10. \n[3]Hey! Hey! Norman! Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker beside him. He swats it flat with his hand. \n[4]Talk to that. The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER. \n[5]That is so Alvin! The bullies strut away, content in the psychological damage they've managed to inflict. \n[6]That was good, right guys? Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as anyone might hear. \n[7]Boom, baby! \n[8]Don't get your bra in a twist, fat boy, this has nothing to do with you! Keep out of my way! \n[9]Or I'll punch you in the boobs! \n[10]You're dead, freakshow! Do you hear me? D-E-D! DEAD! You're gonna be so dead you're gonna have to talk to yourself when you're dead! \n[11]What ya got there, Geekula? Norman launches himself at the book, but Alvin holds him back at arm's length. \n[12]Can't wait to see everybody's faces when they hear about this one! ParaNorman 36. \n[13]Hey! Nobody makes me miss out on a possible date with a girl that almost had some interest in talking to me. Yeah? Thought so! You got nothin' to say! \n[14]Dang straight \"uh-oh\". That's what happens when Alvin gets around here. Uh-oh is that Alvin? Uh-oh Alvin's gonna make me run home to mommy. As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face. The face of a witch. There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning silhouettes the boys. \n[15]Uh-oh. What is that? The wind has picked up, HOWLING through the gravestones. Norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds. \n[16]What's that sound? Norman watches, horrified, as the wet earth atop one of the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through! Norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth. The air is filled with anguished MOANING, the glowing fog dancing and whirling about the hatching figures. The two boys are rooted to the spot, mouths hanging open. CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground into a patch of moonlight. Ragged and rotten it wears the mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan. It stares down at its hands, almost in disbelief, then lifts its face up to the sky and lets out a HOWL. Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes through the turbulent clouds. The boys find themselves backed up against another headstone, this one engraved with the name \"JUDGE HOPKINS\". They leap aside as the ground swells beneath their feet, and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt, bolt upright. His face wears a rictus grin and he looms over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig. He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in Alvin's hand, and HISSES through yellowed teeth. Norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as the Dead Judge approaches, the other zombies gathering behind him. \n[17]Make it stop right now, please! \n[18]Norman? What are you doing? I think I peed my pants! Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run for it, scrambling through the graves toward the gate. \n[19]Are they gonna try to eat our brains?! \n[20]Oh, thank God! ParaNorman 41. \n[21]Wait! Where are you going? \n[22]Dude, what are you doing? \n[23]I really need to get home! I've got like a seriously early curfew. ParaNorman 42. \n[24]My mom gets really upset when I'm not... Something CLUNKS loudly from down the hall, sending Alvin into a desperate babbling panic. \n[25]We gotta defend ourselves! We gotta shoot them in the head with like silver stakes or something! I'm way too awesome to get eaten! Norman, are you listening to me? You really have to do something! Norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old graveyard. One is of the seven tombstones, the other is of the stone marker, which reads \"HERE LIES BURIED THE \n[26]Zombies! I swear, okay? We saw them burst out of their graves! For real! He realizes Mitch and Courtney are staring at him, and tries to disguise his raw panic with nonchalance. \n[27]I'm Alvin. I'm in his class. Norman, not so easily distracted from the problem at hand as the others, glances uneasily through the window. NORMAN'S POV - The zombies lurch arthritically toward the van, GROANING and GURGLING. \n[28]Ha ha! Diarrhoea! \n[29]Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I got you... The hand suddenly bends back on itself, slaps him on the face, and as he SQUEALS it drops to the ground and skitters away into the shadows. Mitch sizes up what's left of his van, and bids a tearful farewell. \n[30]Sure. Picking locks is my thing. Alvin walks over to a notice board beside the door, upon which is a poster for a \"CRIME PREVENTION SEMINAR\". He yanks it out of the ground, hefts it through the window, then reaches through to unfasten the door latch. \n[31]Boom. \n[32]Man. Zombies take over the world and we lock ourselves in a library. Are you kidding me? There's an adult video store just across the street! Neil is more optimistic, and brightly makes his way over to a shelf, and pulls down a slim ledger. \n[33]Yeah, I know, and it's also really boring. \n[34]Hide! \n[35]Hide! \n[36]Just give it up, weiner! \n[37]Shame on every single one of you! How dare you all! Amongst the crowd, doubt is beginning to show. Even the rumbling clouds have gone quiet. \n[38]Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot of the same classes. Pretty much inseparable. Best buds. And we do a lot of psychic investigations together. We have a blog actually, you should check it out. Nearby, Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch. ParaNorman 93. ", "AGGIE": "\n[1]No! Norman reacts with horror. The \"witch\" cowering next to him is no more than eleven years-old. Her long hair is unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from her eyes. Her manacles have been specially made to fit her tiny wrists, and weigh her to the floor. She SNIFFS, scared and confused. \n[2]I was only playing! \n[3]I didn't do anything wrong! A terrible panic comes over her face. \n[4]Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make you sorry! I'll make all of you sorry! Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to spin around him. The faces of the townsfolk, pale and skull-like, swirl around and around, blurring together. In the center of it all, glowing like a bonfire, Aggie \n[5]You're not welcome here. Go away. Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly. The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around. \n[6]Who are you? \n[7]You're not dead. \n[8]And you're a boy. \n[9]You're not like me at all. Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground. \n[10]No you don't. You don't know anything about me. \n[11]What? \n[12]I don't want to go to sleep, and you can't make me! I burnt the book into dust, and now I don't have to listen to that stupid story any more! Leave me alone! Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks under his feet churning. \n[13]What? \n[14]I'm not listening! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA- \n[15]I don't like this story! \n[16]Stop it! If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground, she'd be stamping her feet. Her voice blows bits of bark off the surrounding trees. \n[17]No! \n[18]Stop! ParaNorman 87. \n[19]Shut up! \n[20]I'll make you suffer! \n[21]Because... because... \n[22]They hurt me! \n[23]I wanted everyone to see how rotten they were! \n[24]No I'm not! \n[25]No I'm not! Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos. \n[26]That's not true! Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her. \n[27]Leave me alone! \n[28]Keep away from me! Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggie's tiny hand, as though the air is fighting against him. \n[29]Aggie. My name was Aggie. ParaNorman 89. \n[30]I... I remember my mommy brought me here once. We sat under the tree and she told me stories. They all had happy endings. And then those horrible men came and took me away and I never saw her again! She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground. There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore. \n[31]You don't? \n[32]But what about the people who hurt you? Don't you ever want to make them suffer? Norman thinks this over, and shrugs. \n[33]I just want my mommy... \n[34]That story you were telling. How does it end? \n[35]Is this where they buried me? ", "MRS HENSCHER": "\n[1]You stink of illiteracy! Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any of you know anything about the history of this town? Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed. \n[2]Puritans were strict and devout settlers, who came here to build a home, a place without sin. What is it now Salma? Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased. \n[3]It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to sell postcards and key chains. So let's try it again. Top of page six, Norman. Norman skips ahead on his scroll. \n[4]No no, Norman, with gusto! Like this! Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines, milking every syllable for effect. \n[5]They put her on trial and hanged her! ParaNorman 12. \n[6]But the vengeful witch cursed her accusers, seven of them in all, to die a horrible and gruesome death, and rise from their graves as the living dead; their souls doomed to an eternity of damnation! Now I want you to try that again, but with conviction! My reputation is at stake here, and I won't have this turn out like that wretched Kabuki debacle of oh-nine! As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up, and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes. Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split second the children are replaced with faded figures in real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures. As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows... \n[7]Norman! Are you listening to me, boy? Norman is brought back to the real world with a start, and nods timidly from behind his scroll. \n[8]So am I. Now, unless there's any other issues, let us resume... They put her on trial and hanged her! Neil turns excitedly to Norman. \n[9]Oh, you useless bunch of... The school bell RINGS drowning out her howling voice. \n[10]I saw them! I saw them! The zombies are in the Town Hall! The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire. Several faces turn to Henscher, who is pleased to have an engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly, coming on like Braveheart in curlers. ParaNorman 64. \n[11]Cry \"Havoc!\" and let slip the dogs of war! The faces around her don't react; waiting patiently for a clearer translation. \n[12]Let's rip `em apart! Mrs Henscher points the crowd toward the Town Hall. Despite Hooper's protests, the townsfolk are on lynch mob auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the Main Street toward the Town Hall plaza. \n[13]Let's burn `em out! Obligingly, a couple of townsfolk hurl Molotov cocktails at the windows. \n[14]Necromancer! \n[15]He's in league with them! A few members of the crowd try to push past Perry toward the steps. \n[16]You know what it's like. You join a mob and you say things. I was merely inhabiting the role. ", "PRENDERGHAST GHOST": "\n[1]Aw, nuts. ParaNorman 21. \n[2]Yeah, but I got unfinished business here! \n[3]My ghost isn't going anywhere until I pass on my duty to another! And that would be you! \n[4]Oh it's you all right! I've been holding back the witch's curse for years, but now I'm dead. It has to be you! \n[5]It means the past is coming back to haunt you! Time is running out! The anniversary of the witch's death is tonight. Her ghost is going to wake up, and when she does she'll raise the dead! You gotta keep her in her grave! The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Norman's feet, sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that reach for him as he shrinks back. \n[6]Read from the book at the spot the witch was buried! \n[7]The one in my hands! Norman looks at the ghost's wispy hands. \n[8]Not these hands, my other hands! The me that's at home in my study starting to smell a little funny! Norman looks sick and overwhelmed, but the ghost doesn't let up, swirling right up to his face. \n[9]Get the book and read from it! Before the sun sets tonight! \n[10]Do I look crazy to you? Norman pauses a beat. Mr Prenderghast is floating upside down, various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around him. A piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose. ParaNorman 28. \n[11]Tell me you'll do this! \n[12]Swear! \n[13]I mean promise! \n[14]That'll do! Mr Prenderghast's ghost begins to disappear, bubbling and melting at the edges like a burning photograph. \n[15]Sorry kid, I'm done here! I'm free! I'm finally free! ", "MR PRENDERGHAST": "\n[1]Not much time, not much time... He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover; an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars. Wincing with pain, the man drops the book and clutches at his chest, COUGHING and GASPING horribly. CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs, newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings. It is a shrine of sorts; a madman's recondite genealogy project, and at its center is a photograph of Norman, posing with his family on vacation. ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and through dense trees further and further into a dark forest. \n[2]Psssst! The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch. \n[3]You know who I am? \n[4]I was asking him. \n[5]And you know why you're not supposed to talk to me? Norman tries to back away. \n[6]I can see ghosts too! And I know that's not all you've been seeing lately, is it? Bad omens? Things you can't quite explain? Strange faces peering through the veil? Norman's eyes widen further. ParaNorman 15. \n[7]And I'll bet no one told you about the witch's curse, did they? \n[8]There's something you really need to know! This is the most important thing you will ever hear! The fate of everyone depends on it! Now listen close... The witch's curse is real, and you're the one who has to stop it! Mr Prenderghast grabs Norman's arm and leans closer. \n[9]You've gotta use your gift of talking to the dead! He breaks into a HACKING COUGH, face turning beet red and bloodshot eyes bulging. \n[10]Because if you don't the witch's ghost... And this is the most important thing of all... You have to go up to the old graveyard and... \n[11]This ain't done with! You'll see it soon enough! Watch for the sign! As he hobbles away, Neil peers down the street after the old man. \n[12]I'll show him, and that scary little fat kid... He shakily rummages around the collected papers and trinkets, and pulls out the leather bound book, all the time GRUMBLING crazily. \n[13]Doesn't he realize we're running out of t... With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest, then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with a THUMP. Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of him, sculpting his shape in the air. With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit back in, and he staggers back to his feet. \n[14]No! Not yet! Not yet! He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down onto the ground. The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body. He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body lying at his feet. ", "GRANDMA BABCOCK": "\n[1]What's happening now? \n[2]That's not very nice. What's he doing that for? \n[3]Well he's going to ruin his dinner. I'm sure if they just bothered to sit down and talk it through it'd be a different story. Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as he hears his father shout from the kitchen. ParaNorman 2. \n[4]Tell him to turn up the thermostat too, will ya? My feet are like ice. Norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door. \n[5]Jeez, who rattled your chains? \n[6]Jackass. If I were a poltergeist I'd throw something at his head. Y'know, by rights I'm supposed to be frolicking in paradise with your grandfather, but I'm not. ParaNorman 32. \n[7]I was never one for frolicking. I'll bet there's no cable or canasta up there either. Besides, I promised I'd always look out for you. She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of Norman's bed. She bobs gently, like a balloon. For a second, this seems to comfort Norman, but then another thought crosses his mind. \n[8]In a manner of speaking... \n[9]Of course. \n[10]There's nothing wrong with being scared Norman, so long as you don't let it change who you are. Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She goes to rub his head affectionately, but her ghost hand just passes right through his spiky hair. She gives him a wink, and drifts away through the wall. He is still scared, but now determined too. He steels himself and grabs his jacket from his bed. ", "SHERIFF HOOPER": "\n[1]Watch and learn. \"Parking violation\" is my middle name. \n[2]Pesky kids with their cell phones burning up the oh-zone, that's what this is! She finishes her shake and throws the non-recyclable cup into the bushes. Mitch's van shoots past at high speed in a cloud of dust. \n[3]What the..? Hooper watches the van tear away, the dark shape of the Dead Judge visibly clinging to the back doors, his voluminous cape flapping out behind him like a windsock. \n[4]Pull over the vehicle! The Dead Judge leans further into the van, Neil hanging off him like a pendulum. \n[5]Would've been a quiet night too, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids. Huh! As Perry and Sandra exchange uneasy glances, Hooper suddenly points through the windshield to the riot in progress on Main Street. \n[6]Sweet baby jinkies! \n[7]What do you think you're doing, firing at civilians? That is for the police to do! \n[8]Move along now people, there isn't anything to see here! The townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this. Perry and Sandra have emerged dubiously out of their car and watch from the periphery, utterly bewildered. Mrs Henscher, newly arrived and wearing her avocado face mask like war paint, shakes her shotgun and points down the street. \n[9]You stay right where you are! You may be dead already, but I will still shoot you! ParaNorman 77. ", "DEAD JUDGE": "\n[1]\n[2]You... must... stop... the... curse. A beat. Norman is stunned. \n[3]You can speak to the dead. To us.

QUICK CUTS of the accusers, one after the other, as the Judge finishes his verdict. The notary, the preacher, the townsfolk. All point at Norman. \n[3]...execution. Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE PRENDERGHAST, standing in chains right behind him. \n[4]Do you have anything to say for yourself? \n[5]Aye, with fire! You were speaking with the dead! The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully. \n[6]I'll not risk damnation on these good people. The town Sheriff grabs Aggie by the shoulder.

The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and begin a slow ominous chant. \n[4]So Norman, let me get this straight; you guys all go on this big supernatural adventure and you're calling me in the middle of the night because you need someone to help you do your homework? \n[5]Well, duh. People found guilty of witchcraft weren't considered people anymore. Norman, your witch was buried someplace else... in an unmarked grave! If you cared to pay attention some of the time, you would know that we covered this in fifth grade history class. \n[6]Okay. It says here she was tried in the old Town Hall on Main Street. There may be a record of her execution and burial in their archives. ParaNorman 53. "}}
