How's that sound? \n[5]Give me 30 years, I'll get it. \n[6]Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! \n[7]Feed the dogs. \n[8]I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it. \n[9]On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did? \n[10]Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh? \n[11]Sexy, hm? What was I before? \n[12]coffee, he fumbles with the new glasses \n[13]Let's see... \n[14]Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll meet both of you at the beach in ...20 minutes, okay? Okay. First goddamn weekend of the summer. \n[15]his shirt on over his glasses \n[16]Here? You gotta be kiddin'. \n[17]Love ya. \n[18]Christine what? \n[19]You picked her up on the ferry. \n[20]And nobody else saw her in the water? \n[21]Think she might've run out on you? \n[22]You from around here? \n[23]You here for the summer? \n[24]What d'you pay for a place just for the summer? \n[25]Pretty stiff. \n[26]Maybe that's your girl. \n[27]If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay? \n[28]Jesus, Santos. \n[29]leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks her head and removes the phone from his ear. \n[30]Polly, I want to know what water recreation is on for today. \n[31]Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs? \n[32]Call me later in the day, okay, Harry? \n[33]Get out of there \u0096 take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. \n[34]Do I need any more authority? \n[35]Now tell me something I don't know. \n[36]So we should set out a smorgasbord? \n[37]What else could've done that? \n[38]Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was! \n[39]I was only reacting to what I was told. \n[40]I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. \n[41]What? \n[42]How's the water? \n[43]Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water... \n[44]Michael! Sean! Out of the water. Everybody out of the water! Michael! Get out! \n[45]Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering. \n[46]I'm responsible for public safety around here... \n[47]I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... \n[48]I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. \n[49]Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time. \n[50]I didn't agree to that! \n[51]his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's mood. \n[52]Love a cup of tea. With lemon. \n[53]Where is he? \n[54]Son! -- Out of the water now! \n[55]I want him out of the ocean. \n[56]Michael! Come inside! \n[57]I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself... \n[58]That wasn't funny. \n[59]Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer. \n[60]Hey! You know how many men that's supposed to hold? \n[61]What you got ain't safe. You take some guys off or you don't go out. \n[62]You going out too, Ben? \n[63]Just back up! No, the other way! Cut it to your left! Your other left! The big boat, your front end is out way too far. Little boat, stay still! \n[64]Thanks. \n[65]If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port. \n[66]Hand it over. \n[67]You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. \n[68]Who are you? \n[69]Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident. \n[70]No, it was local jurisdiction. \n[71]No, we just checked the beach... \n[72]You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this? \n[73]Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him! \n[74]Sure he is. \n[75]Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute. \n[76]What d'ya mean? \n[77]Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way. \n[78]She's right. \n[79]I'm going home. \n[80]C'mere and give Daddy a kiss. \n[81]Because he needs it. \n[82]Swell. \n[83]How come you have to tell them that? \n[84]Let's all have a drink. \n[85]You too, sweetheart... \n[86]Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach? \n[87]Something else. Do most attacks go unreported? \n[88]There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh... \n[89]Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts? \n[90]And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing? \n[91]Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. \n[92]I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come? \n[93]What stinks so bad? \n[94]What's that? \n[95]What? What?! \n[96]How can you tell? \n[97]He ate a car? \n[98]What do we do? \n[99]Chum? \n[100]What is all this stuff? \n[101]Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? \n[102]Where'd you get all this? \n[103]You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? \n[104]We gotta get back soon... \n[105]Hey! \n[106]What the hell? \n[107]That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the Flicka! Ben? Ben! \n[108]What happened? \n[109]Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? \n[110]Why don't we just tow it in? \n[111]Be careful, for chrissake. \n[112]You all right? \n[113]No shark did that to a boat! \n[114]There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. \n[115]There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. \n[116]A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! \n[117]We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up. \n[118]He lost it on the way up. \n[119]We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. \n[120]That means closing the beaches. \n[121]Wait a minute! I need you. \n[122]Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August. \n[123]What is this? \n[124]I signed on the wrong line... \n[125]I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here. \n[126]We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay? \n[127]I wish it would rain... \n[128]I'm sorry, I just don't have the time. \n[129]Hey Mikey -- ! \n[130]You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? \n[131]Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. \n[132]Just a favor for your old man. \n[133]Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- \n[134]No whistles! No whistles! \n[135]He's in shock. Get blankets! \n[136]Here -- Take him home. \n[137]No. Home here. \n[138]Got a pen on you? \n[139]There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. \n[140]I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. \n[141]Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? \n[142]The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs. \n[143]Just sign it, Larry. \n[144]This has got to be one big violation... \n[145]What? \n[146]I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000. \n[147]You got it. \n[148]You got it. \n[149]You got it. \n[150]Two cases. And dinner when you land. \n[151]This is Matt Hooper... \n[152]He's from the Oceanographic Institute. \n[153]Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... \n[154]It's my charter. My party. \n[155]You got it. \n[156]Colorful, isn't he? \n[157]Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. \n[158]Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. \n[159]Tell 'em I went fishin'! \n[160]Who's driving the boat? \n[161]Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? \n[162]You got it? \n[163]The wire's showing! \n[164]What's the point with hooks and Lines? -- \n[165]gesturing at rod and reel \n[166]What do we do? Get some help? Radio in? \n[167]How're we gonna handle this? \n[168]Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow. \n[169]Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour... \n[170]C'mon. Middle appendix -- \n[171]What's that one, there? \n[172]What's that, a ship? \n[173]What the hell? \n[174]Where...? \n[175]The barrel! \n[176]Shark! Starboard! \n[177]That's it! Radio in for help! \n[178]Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call. \n[179]Some great idea! Now where are we? Some goddamn skipper you are. You're certifiable, y'know that? You're a real treat! Certifiable! Bananas! \n[180]Did you get him in the head? \n[181]I can't stand here doing nothing! \n[182]What about us? \n[183]Where'd he go? \n[184]Have you ever had one do this? \n[185]There! \n[186]He's trying to sink us! \n[187]He's chasing us! I don't believe it. \n[188]You gotta go in the water... \n[189]He's taken him! \n[190]No... \n[191]What day is this? \n[192]Think the tide's with us? \n[193]Y'know, I used to hate the water... ", "QUINT": "\n[1]Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay? I ordered them. \n[2]They choke on it. \n[3]You all know me. You know what I do for a living. I'll go out and get this bird for you. He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow a man whole. A little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go. You gotta get this fellow and get him quick. If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis. A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks. I'll find him for three. But I'll kill him for ten. \n[4]The bastard is costing you more'n that every day. Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter. I'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether I do it now -- or at the end of summer. \n[5]Did you bring a check? \n[6]Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise? \n[7]And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not. \n[8]And incidental damages, if any... \n[9]And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property. \n[10]And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch. \n[11]Try some of this. I made it myself. \n[12]Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women. \n[13]You want to get paid, you go. \n[14]This is the last time I hear from you. I don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel. Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning. Then you're on the beach. \n[15]I know who he is... \n[16]Transplants? \n[17]I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking. \n[18]Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank. \n[19]Let me see your hands... \n[20]Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. \n[21]What do you mean 'We...?' \n[22]All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast. \n[23]5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons... \n[24]Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. \n[25]Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? \n[26]Who's inside, you or the shark? \n[27]You're in the cage? The cage is in the water? The shark is in the water too? You're in the water with the shark. \n[28]Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'. \n[29]'Here is the body of Mary Lee. For 15 years she kept her virginity. Not a bad record for this vicinity.' \n[30]Cast off the bow line! Now your stern! \n[31]Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... I'll throw your ass through that little round window. \n[32]Now hear this. You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. You'll jump when I holler. We're doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard. Ship with me, and you'll do all right. Cross me, and I'll slap you upside your heads. Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'. \n[33]Here's something for you... \n[34]These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts. \n[35]Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it! \n[36]Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap... \n[37]Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. \n[38]Nobody. We're drifting with the current. \n[39]Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing... \n[40]Get a fresh barrel. \n[41]Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me. \n[42]It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. \n[43]...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do. \n[44]Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we? But he scared 'em all away. Big lonesome son of a bitch... \n[45]-- he'll gulp it down now... Hooooooo! \n[46]Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick! \n[47]Starboard, for Chris'sake -- \n[48]Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... \n[49]Neutral! Where the hell is he going? \n[50]Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- Sure -- try it! \n[51]Makin' believe it's easy now. \n[52]Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now! \n[53]Down here, Hooper! \n[54]Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here! \n[55]Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never -- \n[56]Watch your hands -- Grab onto this! \n[57]A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge. \n[58]Fasten the pole. \n[59]Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle. \n[60]What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does? \n[61]Over there! \n[62]At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine. \n[63]25 feet. And three tons of him there. \n[64]I never saw one that big. \n[65]Orca here. \n[66]Put her on. \n[67]This is Quint, Missus. \n[68]He's busy. \n[69]Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out. \n[70]Here. Rig this to the forward keg up there. \n[71]Get up there and steer her. Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head. \n[72]Hurry up, rig the line! \n[73]Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady now... \n[74]The line, man, the line! \n[75]Get clear, damn you! \n[76]Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch! \n[77]Now you've done it, you piss-ant. Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear. Let the bastard fight the keg for a while. He can't stay down with that on. \n[78]We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him. \n[79]You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark... \n[80]He's up again. \n[81]That's not so bad. Look at this: ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, in Boston, where some sunovabitch winged me upside the head with a spittoon. \n[82]Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off. \n[83]Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas. \n[84]Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here -- \n[85]Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look just like somebody caressed me with a nutmeg grater... \n[86]And I'll drink to yours. \n[87]Wait a minute, young fella. Look. Just look. Don't touch... \n[88]...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last. \n[89]And here's to the ladies. And here's to their sisters; I'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters. \n[90]Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima. \n[91]I almost had 'im. \n[92]Tattoo. Had it taken off. \n[93]'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. \n[94]Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half minutes past midnight, two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side. Two or three. We was still under sealed orders after deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima bomb...we was goin' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn near eleven hundred men went over the side. The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we couldn't cut a single one adrift. Not one. And there was no rafts. None. That vessel sank in twelve minutes. Yes, that's all she took. We didn't see the first shark till we'd been in the water about an hour. A thirteen-footer near enough. A blue. You measure that by judgin' the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... of course the Captain knew...I guess some officers knew... was the bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signals was sent. What the men didn't know was that they wouldn't even list us as overdue for a week. Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't an officer -- just as well perhaps. So some of us were dead already -- in the water -- just hangin' limp in our lifejackets. And several already bleedin'. And the three hundred or so laying on the bottom of the ocean. As the light went, the sharks came crusin'. We formed tight groups -- somewhat like squares in an old battle -- You know what I mean -- so that when one come close, the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the water and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away, but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man -- right into his eyes -- and in spite of all shoutin' and poundin' you'd hear that terrible high screamin' and the ocean would go red, then churn up as they ripped him.  Then we'd reform our little squares. By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred. Hard for me to count but more than a hundred. I don't know how many sharks. Maybe a thousand. I do know they averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. In the middle of the second day, some of us started to go crazy from the thirst. One fella cried out he saw a river, another claimed he saw a waterfall, some started to drink the ocean and choked on it, and some left our little groups -- our little squares -- and swam off alone lookin' for islands and the sharks always took them right away. It was mainly the young fellas that did that -- the older ones stayed where they was. That second day -- my life jacket rubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water. Oh my. On Thursday morning I bumped up against a friend of mine -- Herbie Robinson from Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it seemed he was asleep but when I reached over to waken him, he bobbed in the water and I saw his body upend because he'd been bitten in half beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it went on -- bombers high overhead but nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, sharks, and all this goin' crazy and dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low. Yes. He did that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And early evenin', a big fat PBY come down out of the sky and began the pickup.  That was when I was most frightened of all -- while I was waitin' for my turn. Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up. Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean -- three hundred and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen hundred and forty five. June the 29th. Anyway, we delivered the bomb. \n[95]Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed. I had a little drink about an hour ago, and it went right to my head. \n[96]Start the engines. \n[97]He's busting the shaft! Start the pump! \n[98]The bilge pumps. There -- \n[99]Cut the engines! \n[100]Get up forward! Watch for him! \n[101]Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper! \n[102]Nobody sleeps! Nobody. \n[103]Show me the way to go home... I'm tired and I want to go to bed. \n[104]More left rudder! More! Left hand down now, Chief. \n[105]He's bent the housing. You can hear it. \n[106]It's him. \n[107]He's under the keg. Careful -- \n[108]Easy -- just want to goose him up. The minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands. \n[109]Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's been doin'. \n[110]Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us! Start the engine! \n[111]Easy! It'll tear right out! \n[112]Shut up! Just pump her out! \n[113]Beg your pardon -- \n[114]Duty first and pleasure after -- \n[115]Excuse me! \n[116]No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on -- Slower! Throttle back --- \n[117]Hard to port! \n[118]Try shakin' that out! \n[119]No! No! No! Swing around! After him! \n[120]More gas... go to half! Get me right alongside him -- \n[121]Watch it! \n[122]Atta boy! \n[123]Take two, they're small! \n[124]Order in the court! \n[125]Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble with two! \n[126]Grab yourselves a couple of poles! \n[127]Get ready! Now snag 'em! \n[128]Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom -- free ride. \n[129]Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a little reverse for you! \n[130]Haul in -- watch the prop! \n[131]Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us to pieces. \n[132]Damn head is too far away. He's too big. \n[133]He can't go so deep. Not with all those on him. \n[134]Have to pump her steady, s'all. \n[135]Follow him -- You start pumpin' out here. \n[136]No way! He can't! \n[137]He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?! \n[138]No! \n[139]Follow him! \n[140]Dead astern! Zig-zag! \n[141]Full throttle! To port! \n[142]Throttling back! \n[143]What can that gun of yours do? \n[144]Let go of it! \n[145]He's comin' up -- ! ", "HOOPER": "\n[1]Hello. \n[2]Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, scull it out! \n[3]Just cast off in turn and make for the channel, OK? \n[4]Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me... \n[5]Is that dynamite? \n[6]There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater. \n[7]Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? \n[8]Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. \n[9]Victim One, identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian... \n[10]...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard? \n[11]Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around? \n[12]It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark. \n[13]Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck. \n[14]Who, me? Okay... \n[15]It's a tiger shark. Very rare in these waters, and definitely a maneater. \n[16]I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one... \n[17]There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside. \n[18]Let's just cut him open and see what's inside... \n[19]Wait a minute... \n[20]Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure... \n[21]Martin Brody residence? \n[22]Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him. \n[23]Is anyone having this...? \n[24]Dynamite! How was your day...? \n[25]Here... one red, one white. \n[26]Ummm. Really good. \n[27]I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks. \n[28]I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere. \n[29]They caught a shark, not the shark. Big difference. I could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents. Also, his bite was too small. \n[30]I was lucky to find that in town -- it's an estate bottled vintage year... \n[31]We ought to let it breathe... Whatever. \n[32]Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one. \n[33]Going out on the 'Aurora.' \n[34]Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months. \n[35]Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding... \n[36]Yep. \n[37]Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... \n[38]About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims. \n[39]Rogue? \n[40]It's called Territoriality. It's a theory. \n[41]You could say that. \n[42]I'm flattered you should ask. \n[43]...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence. \n[44]Our friend, the shark. \n[45]We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I figured I'd major in something I knew about. Oceanography, marine biology. It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. Hold the light. \n[46]We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. Simple. \n[47]Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha! \n[48]Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. \n[49]Florida license plate. \n[50]No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here... \n[51]...Nothing. \n[52]If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. \n[53]Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders... \n[54]That's the Cape Light -- we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here. \n[55]Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel. \n[56]Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us. \n[57]I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal. \n[58]It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life! \n[59]I want to check something. Hold my feet. \n[60]They must've hit something. \n[61]He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull. \n[62]We will. There's something I've got to find out. \n[63]A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate... \n[64]Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd believe it! We're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a Shark! \n[65]You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water. \n[66]A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it! \n[67]I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. \n[68]I don't have it. \n[69]Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White. \n[70]I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply... \n[71]That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye. \n[72]Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks. \n[73]I hope we get some more help. \n[74]What I've heard and what I've seen are two different things. I believe there is a large Great White Shark -- Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again... \n[75]Block the estuary! The estuary! \n[76]This is quite a place. \n[77]You're going to need an extra hand... \n[78]I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- \n[79]-- and an America's Cup Trials... \n[80]And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White. \n[81]I don't need to pass basic seamanship. \n[82]Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... \n[83]Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage... \n[84]All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for me. And tell Borack I'll catch up with them in New Zealand. \n[85]An eye for an eye, you know. \n[86]I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. \n[87]Anti-Shark cage. \n[88]Comin' aboard... \n[89]What's that supposed to prove? \n[90]Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. \n[91]Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh? \n[92]That's pilot whale, isn't it? \n[93]Easy for you -- they got a brain the size of a radish. \n[94]Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. \n[95]Let it go, don't waste your time. \n[96]I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark. \n[97]It's too wild, too erratic. It's a marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish. \n[98]I'm okay... \n[99]What do you see? \n[100]20 feet, if it's an inch... \n[101]There's a formula! Girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 -- son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this! -- divide by 2000... three tons! You're right, you old fart! Three tons! \n[102]Damn it! I need something in the foreground to give it some scale. Martin! Stand here! No, to your left! \n[103]Clear! \n[104]Rig another keg! I'm bringing her around! \n[105]God damn it! We had him! I'm coming about! \n[106]Look here. Steve Kaplan bit me during recess. \n[107]Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit. \n[108]Ever see one like this? \n[109]Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples... \n[110]I'll drink to your leg. \n[111]I think I can top that, Mister... \n[112]Gimme a hand, here. I got something to show you -- \n[113]There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary Ellen. \n[114]Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? \n[115]You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus... \n[116]It's a whale out there. \n[117]Rudder bearings? \n[118]Lemme get a better angle on it. Now. \n[119]The shaft is giving. \n[120]Coming right to us! \n[121]We can't rev it up this high -- \n[122]Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already! \n[123]He's heading under -- ! \n[124]He's under! \n[125]Hold her. \n[126]Keep him there! Keep him! \n[127]Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close. \n[128]Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts. \n[129]Take me up. \n[130]Lower away, Chief. Try and keep him off me till I'm under. \n[131]Quint...? \n[132]Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think. \n[133]Just keep kicking. \n[134]I can't imagine why.

You come with us, Lenny. \n[4]C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say. \n[5]Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority? \n[6]That's just going by the book. We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer. \n[7]All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. \n[8]Boat propeller? \n[9]Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along -- \n[10]I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. \n[11]It's all psychological, anyway. You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. I think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July. \n[12]Martin, we hired the best man we could find. \n[13]We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things. \n[14]Now then. We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about... \n[15]Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt. Everybody, could I have your attention? Since this affects all of us, I suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room... \n[16]Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions? \n[17]That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. -- Chief -- \n[18]No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin. \n[19]Only 24 hours! \n[20]Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement \n[21]That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper. \n[22]Who's that young man? \n[23]I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster. \n[24]That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater! \n[25]Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need? \n[26]offstage, with low intensity  \n[27]Chief, I'll take responsibility for this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink. \n[28]I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. \n[29]Let's all get out of here, this place stinks. \n[30]Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? \n[31]What kind of a shark did you say it was? \n[32]Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished. \n[33]I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems... \n[34]Come here, I want to show you something. \n[35]Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns! \n[36]You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic. \n[37]August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend. \n[38]How about them indeed. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship.' \n[39]...I'm pleased and happy... \n[40]Why don't you get in the water? \n[41]Nobody's going in! \n[42]Why? \n[43]I don't know if I can do that without a... \n[44]Maybe we can save August... \n[45]I was acting in the town's best interests... \n[46]My kids were on that beach...

I think it's for the kids, but I love them. \n[35]I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one.
