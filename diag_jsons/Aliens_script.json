They won't tell me anything. \n[6]How long? \n[7]Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... \n[8]No...noooo! \n[9]No.. I've slept enough. \n[10]We made it, Jones.  We made it. \n[11]Dumbshit. \n[12]Have they located my daughter yet? \n[13]Is she...? \n[14]Amy. \n[15]I promised her I'd be home for her birthday.  Her eleventh birthday.  I sure missed that one. Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt.  When it came to flight schedules, anyway. \n[16]You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can.  I never can. \n[17]You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. \n[18]I get the picture. \n[19]Do you people have earwax, of what?  We have been here three hours.  How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story? \n[20]Look, I told you... \n[21]Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder.  Who had access to it? \n[22]That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said. \n[23]I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship.  We homed on its beacon... \n[24]Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... \n[25]...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching... \n[26]That's not all, Goddamnit!  If those things get back here, that will be all.  Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss it goodbye. \n[27]They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. \n[28]Why won't you check out LV-426? \n[29]What are you talking about. What people? \n[30]How many colonists? \n[31]Sweet Jesus. \n[32]No.  There's no way! \n[33]I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it. \n[34]What about you?  What's your interest in this? \n[35]Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial. \n[36]That's right. \n[37]It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse. \n[38]If I go. \n[39]Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month. \n[40]No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you. \n[41]Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever. \n[42]All right.  I'm in. \n[43]And you my dear, are staying right here. \n[44]You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not? \n[45]Just stay away from me, Bishop! You got that straight? \n[46]I've dictated what I know on these. \n[47]Okay.  It's important to understand this organism's life cycle.  It's actually two creatures.  The first form hatches from a spore...a sort of large egg, and attaches itself to its victim.  Then it injects an embryo, detaches and dies. It's essentially a walking sex organ. The -- \n[48]The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it... ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly -- \n[49]Yes? \n[50]Am I disturbing you conversation Mr. Hudson? \n[51]I hope you're right.  I really do. \n[52]I feel like a fifth wheel here.  Is there anything I can do? \n[53]I can drive that loader.  I've got a Class Two rating.  My latest career move. \n[54]Where you want it? \n[55]How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? \n[56]That the atmosphere processor? \n[57]The structure seems intact.  They have power. \n[58]You bet. \n[59]Wait!  Tell him to... ...Hicks.  Back up.  Pan left. There! \n[60]Burke! \n[61]Christ, Wierzbowski! \n[62]Over there. \n[63]Watch it, Burke... \n[64]Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off. \n[65]One of us? \n[66]Come on out.  It's all right... \n[67]It's okay, it's okay.  It's over... you're going to be all right now... it's okay...you're safe... \n[68]Gorman!  Give it a rest would you. \n[69]Here, try this.  A little instant hot chocolate. \n[70]Poor thing.  You don't talk much do you?  That's okay by me.  Most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much. \n[71]Uh oh.  I made a clean spot here.  Now I've done it.  Guess I'll just have to do the whole thing. \n[72]Hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. And a pretty one at that. \n[73]I don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, Rebecca. \n[74]What did you say? \n[75]Well, Newt it is then.  My name's Ripley...and people call me Ripley. \n[76]Pleased to meet you.  And who is this?  Does she have a name? \n[77]What about me? \n[78]Why not? \n[79]Oh, Newt.  You mom and dad went away like that, didn't they? \n[80]They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would. \n[81]Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise. \n[82]Cross my heart. \n[83]And hope to die. \n[84]The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts? \n[85]You're really something, ace. \n[86]I don't know. \n[87]Oh God... \n[88]And the colonists...When they were done with them. Newt, you better go sit up front.  Go on. \n[89]They're right under the primary heat exchangers. \n[90]That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. \n[91]So...then the fusion containment shuts down. \n[92]Pull you team out, Gorman. \n[93]\n[94]They're but off!  Do something! \n[95]Newt, put your seatbelt on! \n[96]Newt?  Where's Newt? \n[97]You okay? \n[98]Looks like it stung him. \n[99]You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. \n[100]No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure. \n[101]Why not? \n[102]They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second? \n[103]Bullshit! \n[104]Look, Burke.  We had an agreement. \n[105]You son of a bitch. \n[106]What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. \n[107]This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right? \n[108]We're going home, honey. \n[109]Run! \n[110]I'm sorry, Newt. \n[111]How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? \n[112]She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training. \n[113]So you better just start dealing with it.  Just deal with it, Hudson...because we need you and I'm tired of your bullshit.  Now get on a terminal and call up some kind of floor plan file. Construction blueprints, maintenance schematics, anything that shows the layout of this place.  I want to see air ducts, electrical access tunnels, subbasements.  Every possible way into this wing. \n[114]Fine.  You do that. \n[115]This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. \n[116]All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door. \n[117]That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here. \n[118]Thanks. \n[119]Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted. \n[120]I'll bet Casey doesn't have bad dreams. \n[121]Nothing bad in here.  Maybe you could just try to be like her. \n[122]Oh.  Sorry, Newt. \n[123]Yes, there are, aren't there. \n[124]Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. \n[125]I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth. \n[126]No, it's different, honey. \n[127]Yes.  A little girl. \n[128]Gone. \n[129]I think it's not the worst idea I've heard all day.  Let's talk about it later. \n[130]I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there. \n[131]Here.  Take is for luck.  Now go to sleep...and don't dream. \n[132]How is he? \n[133]Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those... \n[134]Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least. \n[135]But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from. \n[136]You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs? \n[137]Could it be intelligent? \n[138]I want those specimens destroyed as soon as you're done with them. You understand? \n[139]Burke! \n[140]You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code. \n[141]But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here -- \n[142]You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J. \n[143]You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them? \n[144]Bad call?  These people are fucking dead, Burke!  Well, they're going to nail your hide to the shed... and I'll be there when they do. \n[145]Sorry to disappoint you. \n[146]They're at the fire door. \n[147]How long until it blows? \n[148]And it's too late to shut it down? \n[149]We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow. \n[150]I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something. \n[151]What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that? \n[152]Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually. \n[153]What? \n[154]All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need? \n[155]It's going to be closer.  You better get going. \n[156]On my way. \n[157]Now many? \n[158]They retreated.  The guns stopped them. \n[159]But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile. \n[160]They'll get us. \n[161]Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that? \n[162]What do I do? \n[163]What's this? \n[164]Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself. \n[165]How do you feel? \n[166]Forget it. \n[167]There, there.  Sssshh.  It's all right. \n[168]Newt.  Newt, wake up. \n[169]Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble. \n[170]Hey...hey! \n[171]Hicks!  Hicks! \n[172]I know, honey.  Me too. \n[173]Burke...it was Burke. \n[174]He wanted an alien, only he couldn't get it back through quarantine.  But if we were impregnated ...whatever you call it...and then frozen for the trip back at just the right time...then nobody would know about the embryos we were carrying. We and Newt. \n[175]The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked. \n[176]You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage. \n[177]Just find someplace to lock him up until it's time to -- \n[178]They cut the power. \n[179]Newt!  Stay close. Let's get some trackers going. Come on, get moving.  Gorman, watch Burke. \n[180]Anything? \n[181]Hudson, stay cool.  Vasquez? \n[182]Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations. \n[183]Just get back here! \n[184]Seal the door. \n[185]They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed. \n[186]I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know! \n[187]They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing? \n[188]Can't be.  That's inside the room! \n[189]Medical!  Get to medical! \n[190]Burke!  Open the door! \n[191]Locked. \n[192]Stay behind me. \n[193]DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? \n[194]Back.  Go back! \n[195]Newt, wait! \n[196]Newt! \n[197]Hicks, get down here.  I need that locator. \n[198]Newt!  Star wherever you are! \n[199]Climb down, honey.  We have to cut through this grate. \n[200]Newt!  Newt! \n[201]No!  Noooo! \n[202]No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to -- \n[203]Come on, you can make it. Almost there. \n[204]\n[205]\n[206]She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it. \n[207]Hicks, don't let him leave. \n[208]See you, Hicks. \n[209]Ellen. \n[210]Here. \n[211]Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight. \n[212]\n[213]\n[214]Close your eyes, baby. \n[215]Punch it, Bishop! \n[216]It's okay, baby.  We made it.  It's over. \n[217]You did okay, Bishop. \n[218]Go! \n[219]Here! \n[220]Get away from her, you bitch! \n[221]Come on! \n[222]Right here, baby.  Right here. \n[223]That's right. \n[224]Yes, honey.  I think we both can. ", "HICKS": "\n[1]You just got three weeks. \n[2]Looks like that new Lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts. \n[3]It's a bug-hunt. So what are these things? \n[4]Save it. \n[5]Nothing.  No movement. \n[6]You seeing this okay?  Looks melted. \n[7]Looks like somebody bagged them one of Ripley's bad guys here. \n[8]Just finished our sweep.

Back off, right now. \n[24]Looks that way. \n[25]None taken. Ferro, you copying? \n[26]Prep for dust-off.  We're gonna need an immediate evac. I think we'll take off and nuke the site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure. \n[27]Are you finished? You okay? \n[28]This is all we could salvage.  We've got four pulse-rifles with about fifty rounds each.  Not so good. About fifteen M-40 grenades and two flame throwers less than half full...one damaged.  And We've got four of these robot-sentry units with scanners and display intact. \n[29]About seventeen days. \n[30]We gotta figure on them getting into the complex. \n[31]Outstanding.

That's it. \n[38]We got problems. \n[39]Well, they're into the complex. \n[40]They're in the approach corridor. \n[41]Twenty meters and closing. Fifteen.

But look... \n[44]Newt time then can walk right up and knock. \n[45]I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand. \n[46]How long since you slept? Twenty-four hours? \n[47]Maybe.  Maybe not. \n[48]If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

Now, pull the bolt. \n[52]You're ready again. \n[53]Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that. \n[54]Yeah.  I've noticed. \n[55]Roger.

The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional. \n[11]You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo. \n[12]You are a head case.  Have a donut. \n[13]Hi, Ripley.  This is Lieutenant Gorman of the... \n[14]Ripley we have to talk. They've lost contact with the colony on Acheron. \n[15]Hear me out... \n[16]Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all. \n[17]These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant? \n[18]Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.' \n[19]I heard you were working in the cargo docks. \n[20]Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing? \n[21]What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract? \n[22]If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse... \n[23]Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over... \n[24]Think about it. \n[25]Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi... \n[26]That's the plan.  My word on it. \n[27]Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board. \n[28]A synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out.  Some deaths were involved. \n[29]Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2. \n[30]I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you. \n[31]Still nothing from the colony? \n[32]Here we go. \n[33]Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way. \n[34]Looks like my room in college. \n[35]Hmm.  Acid for blood. \n[36]It's insured. \n[37]Are these the same...? \n[38]These are dead.  There's just the two alive. \n[39]What's he scanning for? \n[40]Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built... \n[41]She's right. \n[42]We're talking thermonuclear explosion. \n[43]Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action. \n[44]Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it -- \n[45]This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them -- \n[46]I know, I know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here.  This thing is major, Ripley.  I mean really major.  You gotta go with its energy.  Since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money. \n[47]Don't make me pull rank, Ripley. \n[48]Corporal Hicks!? \n[49]Look, this is a multimillion dollar operation.  He can't make that kind of decision.  He's just a grunt! No offense. \n[50]This is absurd!  You don't have the authority to -- \n[51]May be could build a fire and sing songs. \n[52]Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life. \n[53]You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it. \n[54]Now, wait a second -- \n[55]Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing. \n[56]It was a bad call, that's all. \n[57]I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this. \n[58]Excellent. \n[59]This is total paranoid delusion. It's pitiful. \n[60]Ripley...help me.  I can feel it...inside.  Oh, God...it's moving!  Oh gooood... ", "GORMAN": "\n[1]You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety. \n[2]We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations. \n[3]At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but... \n[4]Yes, Hicks? \n[5]What's the question? \n[6]All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved. \n[7]Are there any questions?  Hudson? \n[8]All right.  I want this to go smooth and by the numbers.  I want DCS and tactical database assimilation by 0830. Ordnance loading, weapons strip and drop-ship prep details will have seven hours... \n[9]Dead on all channels. \n[10]Thirty-eight...simulated. \n[11]Well...two.  Three, including this one. \n[12]Let's see.  Everybody on line. Drake, check you camera.  There seems to be a... \n[13]...that's better.  Pan it around a bit. \n[14]Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex. \n[15]Okay, let's do it. \n[16]Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station. \n[17]First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear. \n[18]Second team, move up. Flanking positions. \n[19]Quarter and search by twos.  Second team move inside.  Hicks, take the upper level.  Use your motion trackers. \n[20]All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us. First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower... \n[21]...We're coming in. \n[22]Okay, stand by in operations. Let's go. \n[23]Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony. \n[24]No bodies? \n[25]Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block? \n[26]What's her name again? \n[27]Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.  Just start at the beginning... \n[28]Where are your parents?  You have to try... \n[29]Total brain-lock. \n[30]Come on, we're wasting our time. \n[31]PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted. \n[32]Alive? \n[33]Let's saddle up. \n[34]Forty meters in.  Ramp on axial two-two.  Access to sublevels. \n[35]B-Level.  Next one down. \n[36]We're not making that out too well.  What is it? \n[37]What is it? \n[38]Proceed inside. \n[39]They ripped apart the colony for building materials. \n[40]So. \n[41]So?  So? \n[42]Shit. Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there. \n[43]Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung. \n[44]Any movement? \n[45]We can't see anything back here, Apone.  What's going on? \n[46]Who's firing?  I ordered a hold fire, dammit! \n[47]Shut up.  Just shut up! \n[48]Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over. \n[49]I said... \n[50]...lay down  ...by squads to... \n[51]I told them to fall back... \n[52]Ripley, what the hell...? \n[53]What are you doing?  Turn around!  That's an order! \n[54]All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... \n[55]You still want to kill me? \n[56]You can't use those in here! ", "NEWT": "\n[1]And half mine! \n[2]Daddy, when are we going back to town? \n[3]You always say that.  I wanna go back.  I wanna play 'Monster Maze.' \n[4]Do not.  I'm just the best. \n[5]So!  That's why I'm the best. \n[6]Mom.  All the kids play it... \n[7]Timmy...they've been gone a long time. \n[8]N-newt. \n[9]Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother. \n[10]Casey.  She's my only friend. \n[11]I don't want you for a friend. \n[12]Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone. \n[13]They're dead. \n[14]You promise? \n[15]And hope to die? \n[16]I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze. \n[17]Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody. \n[18]I guess we're not leaving, right? \n[19]You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault. \n[20]We should get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon.  They come mostly at night.  Mostly. \n[21]Aye-firmative! \n[22]I don't want to...I have scary dreams. \n[23]Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. \n[24]My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are. \n[25]Why do they tell little kids that? \n[26]Did one of those things grow inside her? \n[27]Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you? \n[28]Did you ever have a baby? \n[29]Where is she? \n[30]You mean dead. \n[31]Ripley, I was just thinking... Maybe I could do you a favor and fill in for her.  Just for a while.  You can try it and if you don't like it, it's okay. I'll understand.  No big deal. Whattya think? \n[32]Don't go!  Please. \n[33]Wah...?  Where are...? \n[34]Mommy...mommmyyyyy... \n[35]Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. \n[36]Look! \n[37]Come on!  This way. \n[38]Come on.  Crawl faster. \n[39]Sure.

", "BISHOP": "\n[1]I'm sorry you feel that way about Synthetics, Ripley. \n[2]I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself.  Is there a problem? \n[3]I'm shocked.  Was it an older model? \n[4]Well, that explains it.  The A/2's were always a bit twitchy. That could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors.  Impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being. More cornbread? \n[5]Attention.  This concluded final maneuvering operations.  Thank you for your cooperation.  You may resume work. \n[6]I'll be in medical.  I'd like to continue my analysis. \n[7]I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon. \n[8]Yes.  That follows. \n[9]That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs. \n[10]Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society. \n[11]Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course. \n[12]Mr. Burke have instructions that they were to be kept alive in stasis for return to the company labs.  He was very specific. \n[13]Bishop here.  I'm afraid I have some bad news. \n[14]That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting. \n[15]I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons. \n[16]I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point. \n[17]I checked.  The hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting. \n[18]I'll go. \n[19]I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid. \n[20]This duct runs almost to the up-link assembly.  One hundred eighty meters.  Say, forty minutes to crawl down there.  One hour to patch in and align the antenna. Thirty minutes to prep the ship, then about fifty minutes flight time. \n[21]See you soon. \n[22]Now, if I did it right... \n[23]Yes, I read you.  Not very well... \n[24]The ship is on its way.  ETA about sixteen minutes.  I've got my hands full flying... the weather's come up a bit. \n[25]\n[26]Ripley... \n[27]In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska. \n[28]I gave him a shot, for the pain. We'll need to get a stretcher to cart him up to medical. \n[29]I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable... \n[30]I had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off. \n[31]Well, thanks, I -- \n[32]Not bad for a human.
