{"dialogues": {"STAUFFENBERG": "\n[1]Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us- \n[2]I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis? \n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]I don't know what I ever did with ten. \n[7]I'm wanted in Berlin. \n[8]Are you asking as a member of the High Command? \n[9]You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in. \n[10]I'm a field officer. \n[11]That's unfortunate for me. \n[12]I'm a soldier, General. I serve my country. \n[13]The people chose otherwise and here we are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don't. \n[14]We all took an oath, General. \n[15]I'm a twin, you know. \n[16]My brother died the day after we were born. \n[17]I was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my children... But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again... \n[18]This is my reward for what happened to my men. It's all I deserve. \n[19]I don't want the damn th- \n[20]I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin. \n[21]These men need no introduction. \n[22]What makes you think the army will follow you at all? \n[23]Oust him, kill him. That isn't what matters. How do you plan to take control of the government when Hitler is gone? \n[24]With all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity. All of you do. \n[25]You said yourself, I'm a field officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all. They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you? \n[26]What are you doing here? I thought I left you in Bamberg. It's a wonderful surprise. Thank you, brother. \n[27]I came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians. \n[28]Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny. \n[29]Plenty of people thought- \n[30]What are you trying to say? \n[31]I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him. \n[32]Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan. \n[33]Children, that is far too- \n[34]Air-raid. \n[35]Valkyrie. \n[36]Not as it's currently written. \n[37]Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed. \n[38]The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command. \n[39]Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup? \n[40]Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using Hitler's   own plan and under our command,   would automatically seize power in   Berlin... \n[41]Precisely. It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it. \n[42]I'm afraid it's the only way. \n[43]I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second. \n[44]And you're neither, Doctor. Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told. \n[45]But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army. It's no secret he's not happy about it. \n[46]I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning. \n[47]I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision. \n[48]In Berlin. \n[49]I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs. \n[50]We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly. \n[51]That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander. \n[52]Second only to the Chancellor. \n[53]Yes... Quite. \n[54]We'll be closer than that before we're finished. \n[55]Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave. \n[56]I've also drawn up an outline for orders to streamline combat groups in order to quietly concentrate forces at vital points - state and government buildings, of course, but also the radio and newspapers. \n[57]Combat groups will be reorganized as reinforced grenadier regiments. One or two of them can be quickly mobilized, eliminating the usual six hour lag. We blitz the government quarter, arrest all Ministers and Party leaders, surround all SS and police barracks. Any officers who resist will be arrested... or shot. \n[58]If anyone comes to you, play ignorant. Just tell them- \n[59]Why didn't you tell me? \n[60]Do you think Fromm reported us? \n[61]You don't mean to say- \n[62]But Olbricht- \n[63]That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move, but it's the only way. \n[64]Perhaps it's better I don't say. \n[65]Why haven't you then? \n[66]None of my associates know we've been talking if that's what you're afraid of. \n[67]You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as- \n[68]It is to me. \n[69]I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success. \n[70]You want us to succeed. Don't you? \n[71]No. \n[72]But my pregnant wife, our four children, the Germany I first swore to defend... They demand that I be something different. They demand that I fight for their future even if it means... \n[73]Even if it means that I never see them again. \n[74]Action is inevitable. As are the consequences. When they come for me I'll do what I can to hide what you knew and when you knew it. But don't delude yourself. You were involved in a crime against your country long before you met me. There's still time to redeem yourself. Only God can judge you now. \n[75]Leave us, please. \n[76]It's the only time I can relax. \n[77]Adjut- What for? \n[78]For Christ's sake. Don't I have enough to do? \n[79]I'll refuse the promotion. \n[80]Dammit, I can't handle the work I already- \n[81]We're not ready. We're moving too fast. \n[82]For what? \n[83]Be seated. \n[84]Do you know how this war will end, Haeften? The portrait will be un- hung... And the man will be hung. \n[85]Bottom line. I'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in? \n[86]Anything is a very dangerous word. \n[87]What about the Panzer divisions in- \n[88]First Africa, now France. \n[89]Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe. \n[90]We'll see if I can't convince him. \n[91]Mein F\u00fchrer, if I may... The situation in Normandy is- \n[92]But- \n[93]Heil Hitler. \n[94]They're all insane. Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect. \n[95]Tell Beck we've found our assassin... I'll do it myself. \n[96]Who else, then? Who can even get as close? \n[97]Valkyrie is very clear. Once the order is given, the Reserve Army will automatically seize control of the government with or without me. \n[98]Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence. I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is- \n[99]We both know there's no other way. \n[100]Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all. \n[101]The country... Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while. \n[102]I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise. \n[103]A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family. \n[104]I love you, Nina. \n[105]I'm one of the inner circle now. They'll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won't touch me. How much time do I have? \n[106]We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications. He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world. \n[107]It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum. \n[108]That could be difficult. \n[109]This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it? \n[110]Fucking politicians. I'll hold off if the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A soldier. \n[111]Him. \n[112]Drive on. \n[113]Himmler. Where is Himmler? \n[114]What do you say? \n[115]My briefcase. \n[116]General, if I may- \n[117]\n[118]Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician. \n[119]I'll do my job. You just take Berlin. \n[120]I'd like to place a call to Bamberg, please. \n[121]As best I can. \n[122]I know the soldier inside me is a traitor. I wonder how I'll be judged as a man. \n[123]By God. \n[124]Bombing in Ebingen. I can't get through. \n[125]Like a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head... \n[126]Nothing... \n[127]Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here. \n[128]Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the F\u00fchrer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me. \n[129]Will Mussolini be in the briefing? \n[130]I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt. \n[131]No room for error this time. Assume I have ten minutes in this heat. \n[132]Two minutes for the walk, one for the security check and one to the bunker. Three minutes for the walk back. That's seven. \n[133]Plenty of time. \n[134]Dammit man, what is it? \n[135]See that the car is ready. \n[136]I have everything I need, Lieutenant. Thank you. \n[137]I can manage, thank you. \n[138]Where are they going? \n[139]My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the F\u00fchrer as possible. \n[140]Sergeant. I'm expecting an urgent call from Berlin... \n[141]Contact General Olbricht in Berlin. Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all communications. \n[142]Drive. \n[143]We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the F\u00fchrer. \n[144]We're on orders from the F\u00fchrer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside. \n[145]Get me General Keitel. \n[146]Yes... General Keitel. Stauffenberg here. I can't get past the outer gate. A Sergeant... \n[147]Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you can explain it to him. \n[148]Quiet, isn't it? \n[149]This is Stauffenberg. Get me General Olbricht. \n[150]It's been three hours, Olbricht. What the hell have you been doing? \n[151]Dammit man, I saw the explosion myself. Nothing else matters now. We are committed. \n[152]Now where is Fromm? Is he with us or did you- \n[153]Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind Germany. Never mind Europe. Your life is at stake now, do you understand? If you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as I say. \n[154]The second you hang up the phone, initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm's name. Then go over to his office in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest. Do I make myself perfectly clear? \n[155]I am at the airfield now. I will be in Fromm's office in fifteen minutes. Be there when I arrive. \n[156]Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. \n[157]You did. \n[158]Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin. We trust you'll join us. \n[159]I delivered the bomb myself. I saw the blast. He is dead. \n[160]Are you with us or not? \n[161]No, General. You are. \n[162]Lock him upstairs in his private quarters. Make sure his phone lines are cut. \n[163]You're not in uniform. \n[164]Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you. We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can we count on the police? \n[165]I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you? \n[166]Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission. I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed. \n[167]...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once... \n[168]Send him in. It's all right. Send him in. \n[169]The F\u00fchrer is dead. The SS is staging a coup. We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany. \n[170]You have your orders. Join us or face the consequences. \n[171]Lt. Herber. Come here. \n[172]Lock him up with Fromm. \n[173]Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders... `Broadcast communique not correct. The F\u00fchrer is dead. Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.' \n[174]I saw the blast... \n[175]Field Marshal Witzleben is right. I am the officer in charge. I am the man responsible. No one else. \n[176]My actions speak for me. I'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together. \n[177]The F\u00fchrer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us. This won't win you any favor. And it won't hide you're involvement. \n[178]You knew and you did nothing. You're just as guilty as we are. Even more so. \n[179]No one will be spared. ", "OLBRICHT": "\n[1]We've been discovered. \n[2]Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night. \n[3]Did you hear what I said? \n[4]There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin. \n[5]We could use your help. \n[6]This war can't be won in the field. \n[7]You can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front- \n[8]It makes no sense. You opposed Hitler, you opposed the war. \n[9]If we win, it will still be Hitler's Germany. \n[10]On behalf of the F\u00fchrer. \n[11]I... I didn't. \n[12]I'm sorry. \n[13]Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry. Colonel, may I introduce- \n[14]We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable. \n[15]Yes, of course, but- \n[16]They would declare a military state of emergency. \n[17]There is one... small problem. \n[18]He's a careerist pig. \n[19]I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg. \n[20]We were thinking the very same thing. \n[21]I think that went rather well. \n[22]You play the part of bureaucrat beautifully. \n[23]There's a man here to interview as your adjutant. \n[24]No one told you? You've been promoted Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army. \n[25]Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't count as service to the Reich. \n[26]You'll do no such thing. \n[27]This is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of. You're in the inner circle now - with genuine access to Hitler, his advisors, his schedule... We need this. \n[28]Not half as fast as the Allies. An invasion is coming, Colonel. Any day now. We must act and we must act soon. \n[29]Tresckow may have left you in charge of the \"central solution,\" but in this world I still outrank you. You will accept the appointment. Is that understood? \n[30]Now. The new man is waiting outside. He comes highly recommended. He might even be an ideal candidate. \n[31]We still need an assassin. \n[32]What if they search your bag? \n[33]Might this be just a little too small? \n[34]Of course, I'm all for redundancy. However... If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then? \n[35]Just how did you manage that? \n[36]Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well. Don't proceed unless you can get them both. \n[37]Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place? \n[38]The members are in total agreement on this. \n[39]And just who this soldier be? \n[40]Him? \n[41]This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness. Stand by for Operation Valkyrie. \n[42]Call Beck. \n[43]This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed. \n[44]\n[45]That man there. Who is he? \n[46]Get rid of him. \n[47]It was only a drill. An exercise. \n[48]Heil Hitler. \n[49]I can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through. If he fails to- \n[50]Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure. \n[51]Noted, Colonel. Thank you. \n[52]Well, what did he say? \n[53]Get him back on the line. \n[54]Only Fromm can initiate. You know that. \n[55]I'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW. \n[56]I can't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler's dead. It's too great a risk. \n[57]Watch yourself, Colonel. \n[58]I know just what Beck will say. He's a dying man. What does he have to lose? \n[59]I can't cover up another false alarm. When Stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation. Then we'll proceed. \n[60]The same place you are. Lunch. \n[61]Explain this. \n[62]We don't know that the F\u00fchrer is not alive. We don't know any- \n[63]We've had no confirmation that- \n[64]Dear God. \n[65]I- No one has spoken to him yet. \n[66]I understand. \n[67]I understand. \n[68]Get Beck and the others. Tell them it's time. \n[69]This is General Olbricht calling on behalf of General Fromm - Commander of the Home Army. Adolf Hitler, is dead. A group of radicals from the SS are attempting to seize control of the government. Operation Valkyrie is in effect. All military districts, training schools and replacement troops are to take control of essential government offices at once... \n[70]General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair. \n[71]There's no use calling, all communication lines are- \n[72]General Fromm is no longer in command. I am. \n[73]You will present these orders to your troops. \n[74]\n[75]And who would have led the men here in Berlin? You? \n[76]The Colonel did more than any man could have hoped.

I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back. \n[4]About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat. You too, if you must. \n[5]They tell me you're critical of the war, Colonel. Not that you don't seem to have good reason. \n[6]In the field, you mean. \n[7]I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions. \n[8]They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing. \n[9]Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel? \n[10]Supreme Commander, you say. \n[11]If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently. \n[12]I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear? \n[13]Tell   your friends that I always come   down on the right side.

I wish to present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement Army. \n[18]Mein F\u00fchrer, we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy. \n[19]I don't know what you've got brewing and I don't want to know... But when the music stops, I'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair. \n[20]That call better have been important. \n[21]How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge. You damn near cost me my commission. What in God's name made you think you even had the authority? \n[22]DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know it was no fucking drill. \n[23]You may not, Colonel. You may not do anything. Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, I'll personally have you both arrested. Do I make myself abundantly clear? \n[24]Heil Hitler. \n[25]I'll hear you say it, Colonel. \n[26]Who told you the F\u00fchrer was dead? \n[27]This is Fromm. Put me through to The Wolf's Lair. \n[28]Yes. General Fromm for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent. \n[29]What's going on up there? The most incredible rumors are circulating in Berlin. \n[30]There's talk the F\u00fchrer's been assassinated. \n[31]Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I should think. \n[32]Certainly. \n[33]A false alarm. The F\u00fchrer is fine. \n[34]\n[35]\n[36]Dammit, man. Do you realize what you've done? The F\u00fchrer is a- \n[37]This can't be happening. It's some kind of joke. \n[38]Colonel, if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once. The rest of you are under arrest. \n[39]I don't know where you think this is going, but I suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to hide. \n[40]Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this? \n[41]I won't ask you to make a choice. That's for you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself. In time you'll see things for what they truly are. You know where to find me when you do. \n[42]Lieutenant. Heil Hitler. \n[43]If you have any last messages, you'd better write them now. \n[44]Noted, Major. Get on with it then. \n[45]\n[46]Continue. \n[47]Very well then...

Thank you. \n[9]There's only one way to be sure... \n[10]I can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction. First the beer hall, Memorial Day - now this. Someone is watching over that sonofabitch, I swear it. \n[11]What makes you think- \n[12]The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement. \n[13]Then stop looking in Berlin. \n[14]I beg your pardon. \n[15]I wonder how the F\u00fchrer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt. \n[16]And I you. \n[17]I'll say this for you, Doctor... You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place. \n[18]I doubt you'll remember much of anything. \n[19]For God's sake- \n[20]All right. What do you think, Colonel? Confront Hitler, force him to resign? Or the central solution? \n[21]They follow a butcher now. What difference does it- \n[22]Operation Valkyrie. \n[23]The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency. \n[24]And initiate Operation Valkyrie. \n[25]Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another. A bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails. In this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason. It's the best idea we've heard yet. \n[26]Fromm... \n[27]Commander of the Home Army. Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie. \n[28]Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light. \n[29]Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death. \n[30]Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely. \n[31]To Operation Valkyrie. \n[32]I've been transferred to the front. \n[33]Would you have stayed? \n[34]It's more likely just... an unfortunate coincidence. Anyway it doesn't matter. You wrote the orders. You know them better than anyone. \n[35]I'm appointing you military leader of the Resistance. Beck agrees. \n[36]We both know Olbricht hasn't the wit or the spine. No. It's you. \n[37]One more thing. You were right what you said that first night. It's not enough to kill Hitler. We need to isolate his chain of command. The slightest confusion could crush us. We need to be certain that no conflicting orders get out after the flash. \n[38]How will you do it? \n[39]God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men. \n[40]I have a feeling that for Germany it may come down to one.

But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf's Lair, I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops. \n[4]This is state of the art. You can have small or precise. Not both. \n[5]The explosion won't do the killing. The air in the room will. \n[6]Hitler's bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete. A steel door, no windows. Just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure. \n[7]Enough to instantly kill everyone present. The second charge will be entirely redundant. \n[8]But as   you said yourself it would take a   miracle.

He wants to proceed. \n[10]They say no. Wait. \n[11]I say do it. \n[12]Put the Reserve Army on standby alert. \n[13]But that's not what he- \n[14]I didn't hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL. \n[15]I... couldn't be sure. It sounded as though he said... Hitler is still alive. \n[16]Sir... The bomb did go off. That much was clear. Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications. \n[17]Colonel Stauffenberg was explicit. We initiate Valkyrie regardless. \n[18]Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead. Or arrest him. But do it now. \n[19]Sir... Did you hear me? You have to give the order to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only- \n[20]Every second we stand here arguing is a second lost. \n[21]What about Stauffenberg? What about his risk? He did his part and now you're abandoning him. \n[22]Shouldn't you be consulting Beck? \n[23]At least put the Reserve Army on alert. \n[24]And where are you going? \n[25]Orders from General Olbricht. \n[26]Someone had to do something while you were playing dead. \n[27]\n[28]General Olbricht's office. \n[29]Stauffenberg for you, sir.

Say what you mean. \n[8]The army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins. \n[9]I beg your pardon, Colonel, but you are in the presence of men who would have been Hitler's inner circle.

What is Valkyrie? \n[12]And what use is that to us? \n[13]While we put a new government in place. \n[14]But only if Hitler's dead. \n[15]That is what you're saying, isn't it? The central solution. \n[16]How else will you make people believe the SS is trying to seize power? \n[17]I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I thought a man of your background would appreciate a more- \n[18]Yes, but- \n[19]Who is Fromm? \n[20]The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE \n[21]I don't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question. I would like to take a vote. \n[22]\n[23]If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here. Say it now. \n[24]Wha... What are you saying? \n[25]This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
