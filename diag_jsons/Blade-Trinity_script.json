{"dialogues": {"KING": "\n[1]Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death? \n[2]He kept biting his own lip. \n[3]Let's FLY, kemosabe! \n[4]Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker! \n[5]Whistler!  We need that serum NOW! \n[6]Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake? \n[7]We're pinned down! Can't you do something?! \n[8]Are you insane?!  We're practically home free!  We can't go hunting for your fucking butter-knife now! \n[9]Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is supposed to be a rescue! \n[10]Is he epic or what? \n[11]So my entrance back there -- what do you think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money? \n[12]My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter, like you. And this little hellion is Abigail Whistler. \n[13]That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part of Whistler's \"contingency plan\". \n[14]Juicyfruit? \n[15]Welcome to the honeycomb hideout. \n[16]Internet porn.  See, we're using cock suckers to pay for the blood-suckers. Joke.  Come on, man.  This isn't some piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade. We take our jobs very seriously. \n[17]You met Dex.  This is Hedges, Sommerfield-- \n[18]The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's daughter, Zoe.  We call ourselves the Nightstalkers. \n[19]We were gonna call ourselves the Super Friends, but that was taken. \n[20]Enough.  We operate in sleeper cells. When one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack.  Consider us your reinforcements. \n[21]Well for starters, I used to be one. Do I pass the audition? \n[22]You know the kind of woman that just screams trouble? You see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off but you still ask for her number? Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But this betty blew 'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes. \n[23]Her name's Danica Talos.  You met her earlier.  The man on her left is Asher, her brother. \n[24]The neanderthal behind them is Jarko Grimwood. \n[25]I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one night stand with her -- then spent the next five years playing step-and-fetch-it as her little vampire cabana boy. Eventually Abigail found me.  Sommerfield here managed to treat me with a cure.  Now I kill them. That's called turning a frown upside down. \n[26]He's real, Blade.  Dig beneath all the movies and myths.  All the layers of bullshit that've cluttered our culture for the last five hundred years and eventually you'll strike the truth. \n[27]The movies are just a comforting fairytale compared to the real deal. There's no happy ending with this guy. Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the last second and save the day with a cross and some holy water. See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a nice yarn.  But the events he described in 1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic. The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much earlier than that. \n[28]Dracula's only one of the names he's gone by.  Now they call him Drake.  If you believe the legends, he was born in ancient Sumeria. \n[29]Nobody really knows the specifics of his origin.  But we do know this:  he was the first of his kind.  The patriarch of the hominus nocturna. \n[30]Every single vampire -- every single monster that's walked the earth since then -- owes their existence to Him. \n[31]He's like the Patient Zero of evil.  The original Serpent in the Garden of Eden. And just like the Great White shark, he's never had to evolve.  This guy was born perfect.  Scour the history books -- \n[32]-- read between the lines -- \n[33]-- you'll find countless references to Him.  Always mentioned, never named. \n[34]He's been there -- \n[35]-- moving behind the scenes -- \n[36]-- cutting a bloody path through the Ages until suddenly -- \n[37]-- just like that -- \n[38]-- he up and disappeared.  About a century ago the trail went cold.  Then we heard a rumor.  The vampires were searching for him -- trying to find the place where he'd retreated.  According to our information, they found him in Iraq about six months ago. And he was pissed. \n[39]When I was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire 'Final Solution'.  But I could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? They've always had plans for the human race.  Seems likely that whatever they're cooking up, Drake's return is a part of it. \n[40]Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a losing battle. So we kill a few hundred of them a year. Big deal.  There are thousands of them out there.  Maybe tens of th'usands.  We need a new tactic. \n[41]Think about it, Blade.  We could wipe them all out in a single move. \n[42]So.  You want to join our club?  Can we sign you up for a Nightstalkers secret decoder ring? \n[43]But with a concentrated burst of UV light instead of your standard hollow-points.  I call 'em sun dogs. Hedges -- super-size me, baby! \n[44]This little mamacita -- a modified version of the Army's Objective Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard, this puppy will pump out. Of course it doesn't have the range of a sword but -- \n[45]We're still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general shape-shifting?  Maybe. \n[46]Question.  Have you ever been laid, Hedges? \n[47]She's making playlists.  Likes to listen to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip hop, whatever kids these days are listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G fan. \n[48]Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite Mick Jagger? Cause you can't get blood from a Stone. \n[49]Hey, they can't all be gems! \n[50]Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake! \n[51]Shit! \n[52]Jesus, it hurts.  I wanna be a vampire again -- fuck!  Did you see that guy?! We're gonna lose, man.  We're gonna fucking lose. \n[53]Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian vampire say to the other? \n[54]-- see you in twenty-eight days -- \n[55]Hey, Blade -- say we're successful.  Say we wipe the vampires out.  What happens then?  You ever ask yourself that? Somehow I don't picture you parked on a porch with a jigsaw puzzle. \n[56]You get me those Fruit Roll-ups like I asked -- Dude.  Aren't you dead? \n[57]Back off, pooch -- \n[58]Jesus Christ! \n[59]What the fuck?!  WHAT THE FUCK?!? \n[60]You made a goddamn vampire dog?! \n[61]How about you take a sugar-frosted fuck off the end of my dick? \n[62]I can tell you two things.  Diddly.  And shit.  And diddly just left the building. \n[63]Okay, here's the deal with the weapon -  It's a new flavor crystal formula.  Twice the chocolaty-goodness, half the calories. Plus, it helps prevent tooth decay -- \n[64]-- gonna be sorry you did that -- \n[65]Sure they are.  Left a trail of digital bread crumbs -- \n[66]One thing you need to know about us Nightstalkers.  When you join our club, you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body -- \n[67]Scout's honor.  One of us gets lost, the others just dial up the satellite and presto, instant cavalry. \n[68]It's in my left ass-cheek -- \n[69]Alright.  alright, it's in my right ass- cheek -- \n[70]No, seriously -- -- it's in the meat of my butt, right below my Bart Simpson tattoo -- \n[71]-- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for yourself. \n[72]No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch -- -- but it will be a few seconds from now. \n[73]Hammer time. See, that tickle in your throat you're feeling right now? \n[74]That's atomized colloidal silver. \n[75]It's being pumped into the building's air conditioning system. \n[76]Which means that the fat lady should be singing right about -- \n[77]\n[78]Nothing a hot tub full of Bactine won't fix. \n[79]Drake's got her. \n[80]Fuck.  Me.  Sideways. \n[81]Bad dog. \n[82]No offense, Danica -- -- but I've wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together. \n[83]Yeah, but here's the beauty -- -- these babies can be triggered remotely. \n[84]Evening Lucius. \n[85]Just a little sport hunting. \n[86]That's an interesting question, my friend. And I've got a question for you in return. \n[87]What do you get when you cross a vampire with a werewolf? \n[88]A fur coat that sticks to your neck. \n[89]Don't you know fur is murder? ", "BLADE": "\n[1]Whistler!  I'm on the Stonebridge overpass at Clemons -- \n[2]Staked you with silver.  Why aren't you ash? \n[3]How should I know?  He was human. \n[4]Like I care? \n[5]Didn't realize this was a popularity contest. \n[6]You worry too much, old man. \n[7]What you've been worrying about. \n[8]\n[9]\n[10]Who --? \n[11]Whistler -- \n[12]Those were familiars -- people who worked for them -- \n[13]An ass-hole. \n[14]There's nothing to tell.  They exist. \n[15]You're with them -- a familiar -- \n[16]He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working for them! \n[17]Call me that again and I'll give you fucking brain damage. \n[18]I can't shoot around corners! \n[19]My sword.  They still have it. \n[20]Now we can go. \n[21]Who are you people? \n[22]I thought the vampires murdered Whistler's family. \n[23]How do you bankroll this place? \n[24]You sound like rejects from a Saturday morning cartoon. \n[25]How many of you are there total? \n[26]Sorry.  Never been much of a team player. \n[27]And what makes you think you know so much about killing vampires? \n[28]Why? \n[29]You gotta be kidding me. \n[30]So the movies are true? \n[31]How early? \n[32]Why wake up Drake now? \n[33]Like what? \n[34]So what's been holding you back? \n[35]Explosive rounds? \n[36]How? \n[37]Time to apply some pressure.  The weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars.  Vampires can't go out in the day, so they get humans to do their dirty work for them Blood-running, safe house maintenance, whatever -- We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll lead us to the real thing. \n[38]Want another spin, ass-hole?  Eventually, your head's gonna pop off. \n[39]Who's your handler? \n[40]Payback, Vance. \n[41]gives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on the ground, some three stories below. \n[42]Why did you kill Vance? \n[43]I wouldn't know about that. \n[44]How can you exist in the daylight? \n[45]That's why they brought you back. \n[46]You're not immortal.  I must've heard a hundred of you people make the same claim. And every one of them's seen the end of my sword. \n[47]What's that? \n[48]-- and we need his blood to kill them. How's this weapon of yours coming along? \n[49]There's something bad inside of me.  This keeps it from getting out. \n[50]Good question. \n[51]We'll check it out. \n[52]Doing a little moonlighting, Chief? \n[53]C'mere.  We need to talk. \n[54]Now spill it, bite-boy. \n[55]What's back there? \n[56]Thanks. \n[57]What's behind Door Number One? \n[58]So will I.  But I'll enjoy it more. \n[59]What was this place? \n[60]The vampire Final Solution. \n[61]Look at this!  Is this the future you want?  You think there's a place for you in their world? \n[62]There's me. \n[63]Go.  You've got thirty seconds. \n[64]Let's go. \n[65]Use it. \n[66]Use it. \n[67]\n[68]appears in the doorway, watching her. \n[69]You alright? \n[70]Don't let it turn inward. \n[71]Where are you taking us? \n[72]Been ready since the day I was born, mother-fucker. \n[73]manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace.  He advances, parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's hammer on sheet metal. Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes.  The moves come faster.  Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated. Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead. Drake retaliates.  Blade locks swords with him.  For a moment, the two warriors are nose to nose.  Then Blade twists his sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek -- Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge.  He touches his fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood.  Then we hear the telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING.  For a brief moment, his facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his true form.  As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve. He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face. He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium.  He SPRINGS forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs into Blade's shoulder.  Blide SCREAMS and we -- \n[74]GASPS, sinking downward.  He's on his knees now, in shock. Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of violence and predation.  And the nightmare shape that was only hinted at before, finally takes center-stage. BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson.  His canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing a suit of razor-sharp thorns.  He doesn't need a sword anymore.  He's become a living weapon.  Drake is gone.  Now he is -- ", "DANICA": "\n[1]Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You know that. \n[2]Cuneiform. Dates back about four thousand years. \n[3]Because this was the cradle of civilization.  He would've been comfortable here. \n[4]What's he been doing? \n[5]Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there - there isn't an army in the world that could keep us safe.  We didn't capture him.  He allowed us to take him in.  You understand? Now open up. \n[6]Your people need you, Sire. \n[7]Times have changed.  Science has made great strides.  Your blood, the sacrament you provide -- it can set us free now. \n[8]I understand. \n[9]Let him out -- he wants to see what's become of his world. \n[10]Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to County General? \n[11]Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere. \n[12]We moved the humans around like, pawns, Blade.  Used them to flush you out. \n[13]Don't make this any harder than it has to be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can help you now. \n[14]King! \n[15]Fucking Hannibal King! \n[16]I should've ripped his ripped his bleeding heart out when I had the chance! And don't you dare tell me \"I told you so\"! \n[17]Blow me. \n[18]We can raze their cities to the ground. We can bring the old world back. \n[19]I can't. \n[20]That's impossible -- \n[21]Old habits -- \n[22]I was a good Catholic school girlOnce. \n[23]And what are your sins?  Would you care to confess them? \n[24]Why? \n[25]Poor little King.  You look so distraught. \n[26]You're tasting a little bland, lover.  Not getting enough fatty acids in your diet? Have you tried mackerel?  Lake trout? \n[27]Oh, there'll be time to play doctor later, believe me.  But for now, we need to have a little talk. Tell us about this bio-weapon you've been building. \n[28]You're brave, King, I'll give you that. But underneath all your swagger -- \n[29]-- I know what you really fear.   What would hurt you more than anything else. \n[30]You don't want to go back to being one of us -- -- do you? \n[31]I'm going to bite you again, King.  And then I'm going to leave you here while you turn.  I'm going to watch you, day after day, while the Thirst keeps building and building.  And then, when you can't stand it anymore -- \n[32]-- I'm going to bring the little girl for you to feed on.  Would you like that, King?  Would you enjoy taking her life? \n[33]Now we're getting somewhere, my pet. \n[34]Excuse me? \n[35]Okay, King, where did they put this tracking node of yours? \n[36]ENOUGH!  It's not funny anymore! \n[37]And what happens then, lover? \n[38]\n[39]appears behind King.  She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the floor, pummeling his face with her fist. King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched. He swings his electronic pistol up -- Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again -- \n[40]I was that bad, huh? \n[41]No bullets in your gun, King. ", "ABIGAIL": "\n[1]Italo Calvino once said that myth is the hidden part of every story, the buried part, the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to enable us to get there. But I was there for the end.  I took part in it.  And I think my words can help shed light on what happened.  My name is Abigail.  This is our story. \n[2]jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons. Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face, SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again. Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as -- -- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING -- Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat -- -- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES -- \n[3]Scream if this hurts, chica. \n[4]I can. \n[5]Forget it, King.  Let's move. \n[6]They did.  I'm the product of an earlier fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock. After the murders happened, he kept me hidden.  He wanted me safe.  Away from all of this -- -- but I guess hunting just runs in our blood. \n[7]When I came of age, I tracked my Dad down, told him I wanted in. Been doing it ever since. \n[8]Tiller needs adjustment. \n[9]We need to pool our resources, Blade. \n[10]Because He's come back. \n[11]Try six or seven thousand years. \n[12]That's what we've been trying to figure out. \n[13]Bottom line is, we need a better DNA sample to work with. We need Dracula's blood. \n[14]Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic protein.  Help me spread the wound open. The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in his body cavity from within -- \n[15]Shut up, King. \n[16]Doesn't do us any good if we don't have time to finish it.  We can't just sit here.  We need to take the battle to them. \n[17]God in Heaven -- \n[18]But where did you get all these people? \n[19]Are they aware?  Do they feel anything? \n[20]King -- \n[21]Zoe -- where's Zoe? \n[22]Where is she?! \n[23]I'll be fine. \n[24]It already has.  Since I can remember I've had this knife of sadness in my heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment I pull it out -- -- I'll die. \n[25]We told you, Blade.  We operate in sleeper cells.  When one goes down, a new cell activates to pick up the slack. \n[26]You alright? \n[27]Zoe -- \n[28]Come on, hon.  Let's get you out of here. \n[29]Blade! \n[30]\n[31]It didn't take long for the authorities to arrive. \n[32]When they got there, all of Drake's people were dead. \n[33]In the weeks that followed, the rest of the world's vampires also perished. We'd finally won. \n[34]And Blade?  Cumberland and Hale finally got their body -- \n[35]The virus didn't kill Blade.  But the authorities very well could have.  So in the end, realizing that own his people were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a gift. \n[36]By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade enough time to escape.  Offering Blade a second chance at life - - \n[37]And so Blade took it. \n[38]We never saw him again. \n[39]He disappeared completely. But that's what heroes do.  They simply fade out.

FOOTSTEPS.  Drake opens his eyes, SEES Danica hovering in the darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light. \n[3]This world sickens me.  The humans have soiled it with their filth. \n[4]Come closer. \n[5]And do you know why? Once, all of my kind could brave the day. We were true predators.  The world was ours.  And then, somewhere along the way, the purity of our bloodline became diluted.  Polluted with human DNA. \n[6]Is it? \n[7]You are bastard children.  No longer as pure as you pride yourselves on being. \n[8]My people.  How far you have fallen. \n[9]BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow. She spins, falling -- -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast. \n[10]So you're the hunter they all fear. \n[11]stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his arms.  In the full glare of the afternoon sun. \n[12]Just so we understand each other, Daywalker. \n[13]He'd outlived his purpose.  He'd become a liabi1ity. \n[14]Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before. Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter who carried it was an accomplished fighter. \n[15]He was honorable, in his own way.  He died a good death. \n[16]You lie.  You're part of a grand tradition, Blade.  You hunters have plagued my people since the day we first walked the earth.  And I have vanquished them.  One by one. \n[17]I've always been able to.  Haven't you read Mr. Stoker's fable?  I was the first of the vampires.  I am unique. \n[18]Yes.  My children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight.  Through me, they believe they can all become Daywalkers. \n[19]The world's changed much since I went to sleep.  How crowded it's become.  Look at them down there.  Lives brief as fireflies.  Do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us? \n[20]Perhaps I will as well, then.  But I think it's more likely that you will fall before mine. Catch. \n[21]Why do you wear that -- symbol? \n[22]I was there when they crucified him.  He died -- for their sins, not mine. \n[23]Too numerous to remember. Take it off. \n[24]I'll make you a better one. \n[25]There's an old saying -- \n[26]Kill one man, you're a murderer. Kill a million, a king. Kill them all, a God. \n[27]Do you know who I am? \n[28]The Nome King.  I like that. Tell me, child.  Do you want to die? \n[29]There is no Heaven.  No God.  No angels. No happy ending for good little girls. The only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness. \n[30]But what if you could change that?  What if you could remain a child forever? \n[31]What if you could keep this little doll- like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold, hard rock? Wouldn't you like that?  Wouldn't you accept that gift? \n[32]stands before him, waiting, sword in hand.  He extends it, touching the tip to the floor.  A challenge. \n[33]Are you ready to die, Blade? \n[34]Then allow me to accommodate you. \n[35]breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it takes to blink an eye.  No one could possibly deflect the blow.  And yet -- \n[36]Well done, hunter.  Well done. \n[37]You fought with honor -- \n[38]-- as I knew you would.  The humans are coming for you, you know.  In their eyes, you and I are the same. Allow me one last indulgence, then -- -- a parting gift -- ", "VANCE": "\n[1]Yes.  I've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind.  Of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about. \n[2]Monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external.  In the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism. These are scary subjects for people to own up to. \n[3]Exactly.  Historically, people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats.  In the Middle Ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession. \n[4]Well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits.  People suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic -- \n[5]Blade is a very disturbed individual. Even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling.  According to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. You have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here.  What does a person like Blade really want? Odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself. \n[6]Let's leave the diagnosis to the professionals. \n[7]Hello, Blade.  My name is Doctor Vance. I'm with the Department of Mental Health. I've been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you. Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few moments alone? \n[8]I imagine this must be very frightening for you.  But I want you to know that I'm here to help.  In order to do that, however, I need to ask you some questions. Now.  Can you tell me what day it is? \n[9]What about the President?  Do you know who's in the White House at the moment? \n[10]Alright then, let's talk about vampires -- what can you tell me about that? \n[11]And are you one of them? \n[12]What about blood?   When you drink it, do you find yourself sexually aroused? \n[13]You see, it strikes me that this business of vampirism has strong connotations of sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have to ask where that comes from.  I'm wondering, for instance, what your relationship was like with your mother. Were the two of you close? \n[14]He's psychotic, with paranoid features, possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He obviously doesn't have a properly formed conscience -- For his safety and the public's, I'm recommending that he be transferred to County Psychiatric for further treatment. \n[15]Agent Cumberland, that man is in no condition to undergo prosecution. \n[16]I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has already been made.  A team from the hospital should be here momentarily to oversee the transfer. \n[17]Just a little something to keep you compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe three hundred milligrams.  But for a strapping young hybrid like yourself -- \n[18]-- I think we'll kick it up to a couple thousand. \n[19]There.  That wasn't so bad, was it? You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human like myself could overpower you? \n[20]Going on five years now. \n[21]It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans are finally coming to fruition.  So just sit back and enjoy the show. \n[22]This is Dr. Vance.  Did someone page me? \n[23]I'm Dr. Vance.  Welcome to our facility. As a member of the medical profession I want to assure you that I will do everything in my power ro provide you with the care and compassion that you deserve. \n[24]What does it mean to be human?  Since the dawn of creation our ancestors have asked ourselves that question. \n[25]The modern world today is filled with countless challenges.  In every direction we look, toxic stressors are impacting upon our happiness.  We think we're healthy, but the truth is, our immune systems are engaged in a life or death struggle to maintain our well being. \n[26]Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain how a series of remarkable new breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the quality of your life \n[27]What --? ", "SOMMERFIELD": "\n[1]I don't think you understand, Blade. Whistler meant for us to help you.  When he died, he activated an emergency protocol.  All his knowledge -- \n[2]--was transferred to our servers here. \n[3]A biological weapon. \n[4]For the last year I've been~working with synthesized DNA in order to create an artificial virus targeted specifically at vampires.  We're calling it DayStar. \n[5]We've tried it on a number of captive subjects.  We've got the disease vector worked out fine -- it's easily transmittable.  But the lethality in vampires is still spotty. \n[6]Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless junk DNA.  Because Dracula's the progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is still pure.  It hasn't been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation. It still has all the necessary cellular compounds for the virus to code to.  We get his blood, we can boost Daystar's viral efficacy to a hundred percent. \n[7]The virus is harmless to humans.  So we decided to go after the vampires' food source.  The one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood. If we manage to pull this off, we'll be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet.  They won't have anyone left to feed on. \n[8]If the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in Drake that makes him immune to sunlight, they'll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions.  For instance, there's an enzyme called Taq Polymerase.  And there are only a limited number of suppliers. Give me a few hours.  I'll see if I can't hunt us up some leads. \n[9]I think I've got a lead. \n[10]Biomedica Enterprises.  They've been buying up all sorts of supplies -- Taq polymerase, bone marrow growth supplement, genetic sequencing enzymes. \n[11]'The reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good.  Now, the Nome King had never tried to be good, so he was very bad indeed.  Having decided to conquer the Land of Oz and to destroy the Emerald City and enslave all its people, King Roquat the Red kept planning ways to do this dreadful thing, and the more he planned the more he believed he would be able to accomplish it --' \n[12]Guys?  You okay --? \n[13]Zoe, go find some place to hide, sweety. \n[14]Damnit, go!  Get out of here, Zoe! \n[15]If you're watching this, I'm already dead. If Zoe's still alive, I want you to promise you'll take care of her.  I've been reading her The Oz books every night. We just started The Emerald City of Oz, the one with the Nome King -- \n[16]I think I've managed to cultivate a workable strain of the Daystar virus.  As a precaution, I transmitted the genetic sequence to Caulder, in case our main stock was destroyed.  In order for it to achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to interfuse it with Drake's blood.  If it works, any vampires in the immediate vicinity should die almost instantly. After that, it should take only a few weeks for the virus to spread throughout the rest of the world. \n[17]There's one other thing, Blade.  You need to know that there's a chance the virus could destroy you too.  Because you're a hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune system will be able tolerate it. I'm sorry.  We didn't have enough time to properly test it. ", "WHISTLER": "\n[1]What the fuck happened tonight? \n[2]You've been getting careless, Blade.  You kill a vampire, they ash, don't leave any proof of their existence.  But something like this, a human corpse, it's messy -- -- you better hope nobody IDed you. \n[3]Pack of Reds and some matches. \n[4]I'll take this too. \n[5]Congratulations.  You're famous.  Just what we needed. \n[6]Somebody screwed us.  Your face is all over the papers, the television.  Media's eating it up. \n[7]You should.  Something like this -- -- taking out a human, even one working for the vampires -- far as the rest of the world's concerned, you're public enemy number one. \n[8]Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's happening?!  The fuckers are finally getting smart.  They're waging a goddamn PR campaign.  Now it's not just vampires we have to worry about, we're gonna have to take on the rest of the world too. They've got us on the run.  These last few months we've barely been staying ahead of the curve. \n[9]I've been doing this since before you were born, Blade.  The moment you stop worrying, you're dead. \n[10]Since the day I found you, you've been like a son to me.  I taught you everything I know. But I'm tired.

Time to take these cowboys down. \n[2]Got him. \n[3]Lock it down!  Keep them contained! \n[4]Take him down! \n[5]Rise and shine, sleepyhead. \n[6]Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson Hale, FBI.  We've been tracking you for a long time. \n[7]How many people have you killed?  Thirty? Forty?  A hundred? \n[8]And by \"them\" you mean vampires, right? I suppose next you'll be telling us that Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy? Maybe you can give us some pointers. You can stake 'em, right?  Then there's sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson? Do those still work? \n[9]That's a good point.  And does garlic work on a Hindu vampire?  Or do you need saffron or something? \n[10]You can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want, Blade, but it's not going to play.  You're a stone-cold killer.  And you're sick as fuck. \n[11]That's unacceptable.  This man's wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes.

We underestimated the Nightstalkers. \n[7]Has he been told yet? \n[8]His name's Beau.

The truth is, our streets have never been safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent crime is down across the board.  If people want to be concerned, they should focus on criminals like Blade. \n[2]He's a sociopath we've been pursuing. \n[3]What's your assessment, Doctor? \n[4]I don't care about your warrant.  We're in my jurisdiction now.  You've got an issue with that, you take it up with the local magistrate. \n[5]They'll kill me -- \n[6]It's a blood farming facility.

But another human, someone with the same approximate body mass -- given enough practice it might be possible. \n[6]He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal structure.  Probably something more like a snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array.
