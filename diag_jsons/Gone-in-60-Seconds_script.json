You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ... \n[94]\"Over--\"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron-- \n[95]He's gonna kill you -- ! \n[96]You can handle it? \n[97]You can handle it? \n[98]You? \n[99]You? \n[100]You don't think so, huh? \n[101]What's with the fish thing -- ? \n[102]Fish. \n[103]Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of \"Karaoke.\" \n[104]You have a Hollandaise sauce ? \n[105]Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce \n[106]I think about that night a lot... \n[107]How they were just there ...

The part bins? \n[115]You, too, Otto \n[116]He's gotten involved -- \n[117]You think it can be done? \n[118]Tell me... \n[119]The hard part ... \n[120]Is he still working here ? \n[121]I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me \n[122]And the moral of that story is -- ? \n[123]How you doing, man? \n[124]You know where the others are? \n[125]Forget that ... \n[126]That's right. Only 10 exotics ... \n[127]If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield? \n[128]Well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence... \n[129]I know. Weird, huh -- ? \n[130]What are you doing here? \n[131]No we don't - \n[132]His criminal career has officially come to a close ... \n[133]We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean \n[134]You hear me? \n[135]How old are you now, Toby? \n[136]Okay, then... Otto? \n[137]You got maybe a better plan? \n[138]\"Shadow games?\" \n[139]You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. \n[140]Go on, Otto - \n[141]Yeah. He's knows of one all right. \n[142]See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea -- \n[143]The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old... \n[144]You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's? \n[145]Buy you a drink? \n[146]\"Mitch?\" \n[147]So I was replaced by Mitch? \n[148]Wow. And to think all I accomplished these past six years was the \"LORD OF THE RINGS\" trilogy... \n[149]You look great -- \n[150]On account of Mitch? \n[151]I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? \n[152]I left town. I didn't leave you. \n[153]And here I am... \n[154]Kip's in trouble \n[155]Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared. \n[156]Six or seven... \n[157]I understand - \n[158]I'd go so far as to say \"lovely.\" \n[159]Really? \n[160]What's it look like? \n[161]Is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted face? Agonized and writhing and ugly? Oh, now I see it, yes, yes! \n[162]If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ... \n[163]Where'd you pick her up? \n[164]Well, take it back -- \n[165]Take it back, Freb -- \n[166]You know my back. \n[167]Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello. \n[168]You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? \n[169]Let her rip ... \n[170]I don't think so, Detective ... \n[171]Take her back to where you found her, Freb -- \n[172]Hey - \n[173]Kip - \n[174]What do you got there? \n[175]What time of year? \n[176]You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died? \n[177]Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars? \n[178]Imagine that -- ? \n[179]Mother -- ! \n[180]I remember, every day, he'd come home in a different car. That was the greatest thing ... And we'd climb all over it ... Examine every inch of every different car ... \n[181]You remember that, Kip? \n[182]After he died ... I think that's what I missed most of all ... That there was no different cars every night ... When I started hanging around Otto's ... And he started showing me the things ... It was a way to kill two birds ... Put food on the table for you and Kip ... And ... Ride in different cars every night ... Just like when Dad was here. \n[183]We're gonna have to do this thing, Ma. \n[184]We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all \n[185]This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. \n[186]The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. \n[187]All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say \"Eleanor lives at such and such... \" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ... \n[188]And there she is -- \n[189]Hello, Eleanor -- \n[190]She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... \n[191]She soars - \n[192]See you in a few days, Eleanor -- \n[193]So what's in there -- ? \n[194]That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her \"Sway.\" \n[195]Of course ... \n[196]Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ...

He owned the estate they lived on ... \n[201]Hello -- ? \n[202]What's wrong with her -- ? \n[203]Annie -- ? \n[204]Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself \n[205]They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area... \n[206]I put the boys on it. They're clever that way... \n[207]That what you want? \n[208]Okay. \n[209]I missed you, you know - \n[210]I always thought you'd follow me up. \n[211]Very good... \n[212]No way ... \n[213]No ... \n[214]Oh. Okay. Right. \n[215]I'm on the move - \n[216]Not my girl anymore \n[217]What do you want from me? \n[218]This one ... \n[219]What's that thing -- ? \n[220]How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...? \n[221]Thank-you ... \n[222]Ain't we good-timing here ... ? \n[223]Dad'd be proud -- \n[224]What era was that -- ? \n[225]As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher? \n[226]What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? \n[227]We've got to shake them tomorrow night. I'm making that your problem. That's called delegation of duties. You like it -- ? \n[228]Okay. Tomorrow night it's on. Each team has been assigned their ladies. The teams are: me and Sway. Donny and Freb. Kip and Tumbler. Mirror Man, you and The Sphinx ... \n[229]You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ... \n[230]Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ... \n[231]Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ... \n[232]Get out of here, Ray -- \n[233]Get out -- \n[234]Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart... \n[235]How we doing, O -- ? \n[236]Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions? \n[237]Only use the phones when absolutely necessary... Otto's default HQ ... Let's go get 'em... \n[238]Ready -- ? \n[239]No. Open her ... \n[240]A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ... \n[241]Let's cruise -- \n[242]Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses? \n[243]Wow. Bozo, the very sexy clown -- \n[244]No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look... \n[245]Her parole officer strongly recommended it ... \n[246]Having fun, Kip? \n[247]How's it going? \n[248]C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ? \n[249]I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good -- \n[250]Let's go, people -- \n[251]You okay -- ? \n[252]Too early to tell. Nervous? \n[253]That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you... \n[254]That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... \n[255]Showtime -- \n[256]Hello, Tracy... \n[257]Shit. \n[258]What's this guy up to -- ? \n[259]... okay, check with you soon ... \n[260]Otto says 22 ladies have reported for work... \n[261]Man, they're going at it \n[262]What about you? \n[263]Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. \n[264]I approach you. It's quiet. I look this way. That. No one around ... \n[265]I take out my slim-jim... \n[266]Slip it in ... \n[267]Unlock your button ... \n[268]The alarms go off ... \n[269]I pop your hood; find your siren wires \n[270]I do ... I cut \"em... \n[271]Now... I'm in ... \n[272]I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... \n[273]With a twist of my wrist ...

We'll getcha fixed up... \n[283]Call 911 - \n[284]\n[285]What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you? \n[286]Come here -- \n[287]Come here - \n[288]Come here - \n[289]I know. I've missed you, too \n[290]I know ... \n[291]Stay here. Stay here a while. I'll be back ... \n[292]Give me a ride -- ? \n[293]Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go -- \n[294]Yeah ... You -- ? \n[295]You should know: walking away from my mother, my brother, this town. Was hard. Walking away from you. Nearly killed me... \n[296]Shit ... \n[297]Shit ... \n[298]Yes, sir. \n[299]The truth is - my car here doesn't have a tape deck.

Any word on Donny? \n[327]What happened to Sway? \n[328]You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ? \n[329]She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ... \n[330]Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like \n[331]I'll see you soon -- \n[332]Thought I'd go for a ride - \n[333]You'll see me ... \n[334]Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride? \n[335]I dunno.

Let's see if these British boys are full of shit or not -- \n[6]No problem - \n[7]What do you say, Toby?, \n[8]No ... And they won't take my calls ... \n[9]It ain't what you'd call a \"good sign\" \n[10]Look - we managed to get 13 in a week. We just gotta step it up ... \n[11]That, too ... Don't sweat it, Freb. We're cool. \n[12]It can be done, man. We just gotta step it up... It's a challenge ... \n[13]Hello, Memphis -- \n[14]It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look - \n[15]It's nice to see ya, man - \n[16]Who's got next game -- ? \n[17]That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving \n[18]\"Give lim back the money.\" \"Give 'im back the money...\" Be nice. If only we didn't drink the money. And smoke the money. And buy Nikes with the money. And Sony Play Stations with the money. And dirty girls with the money... \n[19]But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... \n[20]Sure they are. Although we do appreciate the gesture, Memphis. But we do got it handled... And it was nice to see you -- - \n[21]Yeah... You want a ride... \n[22]How'd you get here?

Computer chip keys and sophisticated alarms and I don't think, an old guy, could much bypass 'em... \n[62]Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ... \n[63]Hey, Donny -- \n[64]Otto called - \n[65]I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ... \n[66]I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand... \n[67]Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ... \n[68]Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business \n[69]You spread it out ... you move around...

Little something the R &amp; D department came up with ... \n[86]After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ... \n[87]De nada ... \n[88]The family that steals together, deals together... \n[89]Maybe not.

Always take along a good mix tape ... \n[34]You bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of lovemaking you intend to do, right? \n[35]You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes.

It's like watching a child grow ... \n[10]My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them... \n[11]Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ... \n[12]No, no. You don't kill me, because you can't. You don't take your brother and run, because we'd find him. You don't go to the-police, because we have friends there, too.

I'm paying 200 thousand dollars ... \n[18]I knew you'd say that. \n[19]I knew you'd say that, too -- \n[20]Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ... \n[21]I made this, too. My first one. Brass extension handles, not plated. The coverings are silk, not rayon. Expensive hardwood.
