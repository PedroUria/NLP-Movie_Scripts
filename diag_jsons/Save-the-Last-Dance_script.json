{"dialogues": {"SARA": "\n[1]Used to. \n[2]Everybody there's going to be good, Mom. I have to be better. My knees still knock when I do my free form. Did you notice that? \n[3]It's not supposed to be fine. It's supposed to be special. \n[4]And it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. I bet they notice that. That it doesn't do anything. That I don't do anything special enough to get in. \n[5]Don't lie because you love me.     My free form sucks. \n[6]I love the necklace but you're still the best luck I'll ever have. \n[7]Oh. It's a good luck charm. Doesn't always work. \n[8]Lindsay... no. Not here. \n[9]Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He actually told me to break a leg. \n[10]Know what would be great? If you didn't drop me off at the bus station. If we just kept going until we get to Philly. \n[11]Right. This is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can. Thanks, Mom. \n[12]So I guess I'll see you later. \n[13]Swim?   You can't swim, Mom. \n[14]Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme. \n[15]Thank you. \n[16]Hi. \n[17]Slept through most of it. \n[18]Two suitcases.     One big one. \n[19]I'm kinda tired. \n[20]Uh-huh. \n[21]Thought you were moving to Fells Point. \n[22]You bought a bed? \n[23]Do you have a phone? \n[24]You didn't at the last place.    The last place I saw anyway. \n[25]Over the summer. You blew me off for some gig on the road, remember? Can I call Lindsay? Let her know I got here alright. \n[26]I feel fine.     I feel like calling Lindsay. \n[27]I can take the school bus. Tomorrow. \n[28]Well, I know how to do both. \n[29]-- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy. \n[30]Like you stay on top of yours? \n[31]I didn't mean it like that. \n[32]You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really. \n[33]Yeah.   Sure. Whatever. \n[34]About school?     No.   Not really. \n[35]I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right? \n[36]Thanks. \n[37]It's a non-fiction novel. The first of its kind. Capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up. \n[38]Yeah.   That is part of it. \n[39]Lots of people read them. \n[40]Sara.   It's Sara. \n[41]God!    Thank you! \n[42]What's it called? What she's doing? \n[43]No, I mean... the step, the... \n[44]Asshole. \n[45]He's in one of my classes. Thinks he's so... smart. So cute. \n[46]So you know him? \n[47]He's embarrassing. \n[48]Fine. \n[49]What? \n[50]I had a big lunch. \n[51]It's a school night, Roy. \n[52]I know it's too big. \n[53]Who died and made you teacher? \n[54]Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly. \n[55]I don't know... \n[56]For what? \n[57]Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes. \n[58]I don't even know where it is. \n[59]That's okay. I dance in circles. Probably around you. \n[60]Chemistry. \n[61]Right now it's taking me. \n[62]I'll be asleep. \n[63]Cool outfit. \n[64]... I look okay? \n[65]Hi. \n[66]Is that... is he... yours? \n[67]Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat! \n[68]Wait. I have to ask you something. Do I really look alright? \n[69]It's from the GAP. \n[70]I'm not walking in there in my bra. \n[71]Can't get much more underground than this. \n[72]What are you, some kind of V.I.P.? \n[73]Sara. It's Sara. And I know you. We have a class together. \n[74]Maybe you came to the wrong spot, Nikki. I'm pretty sure this one doesn't have any Negroes. \n[75]Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything. \n[76]It's just a beer. \n[77]Whatever. \n[78]Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything. \n[79]I don't feel like dancing. \n[80]Would I be here if I didn't? \n[81]It's just a few blocks.   It's okay. \n[82]What? \n[83]I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you. \n[84]It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad. \n[85]Not like that. You were really kicking his ass. \n[86]Are you laughing at me? \n[87]Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him. \n[88]It was great. \n[89]It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick. \n[90]Not all the time. But a lot. \n[91]We passed it. \n[92]Thanks for walking me. \n[93]So.      I'll see ya. \n[94]I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay? \n[95]Oh. \n[96]You're right. I should've said something. I'm sorry. \n[97]Nope.     Nothing special. \n[98]Just adding to my collection. I heard some stuff I didn't have last night. \n[99]Not as fly as you. \n[100]Not yet anyway. \n[101]Okay.   Sure. \n[102]Not to me. \n[103]It was so... slamming, Lindsay. The dancing! I'm going again. What? No, I haven't seen anybody get shot yet. God, I didn't move to Bosnia. \n[104]What happened? \n[105]How 'bout fuck it? Or should I say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest, Roy. \n[106]Sorry you got caught. \n[107]Really?   How often do you have it? \n[108]I don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. Things happen. Things change. And the changes change you. What's the point of plans? \n[109]You can't direct destiny. \n[110]That was a long time ago. \n[111]I don't know. Take a year off. Work. Go to college later on. \n[112]Did you always want to be a doctor? \n[113]Chenille.   Everybody. \n[114]What kind of doctor do you want to be? \n[115]Do you have any? Kids. \n[116]I wasn't being smart, Patrick. \n[117]Screw you.      I'm brilliant. \n[118]I didn't get it. That thing you just did. Show me again? \n[119]A releve.    Over ice.     With a twist. \n[120]Ballet. I used to dance, Patrick. \n[121]Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any more. And don't ask me why. \n[122]Because I don't want to talk about it. \n[123]Because it's not a big deal.       Can we just concentrate on this? \n[124]I have met somebody. Sort of.       I think. I mean, there's this guy... \n[125]What are you doing? \n[126]Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go to Juilliard. That school fucked up my entire life. It's a long story. \n[127]Why'd you do that? \n[128]That's a good reason. \n[129]You and Malakai? \n[130]I don't get you guys.    You seem so... different. \n[131]Maybe you weren't then but you are now. You said you changed. \n[132]I think Malakai's scary.   And I know you're not. \n[133]Patrick. \n[134]That means you owe him something? \n[135]No matter how much he messes up? \n[136]I stole a hat once. When I was twelve. My mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back. \n[137]You gonna turn me in? \n[138]Yeah...tight... got along and shit \n[139]There's nothing to say. \n[140]I'm sorry she's dead. God! What do you want me to do? Run through the streets screaming? \n[141]Well, it won't. So drop it. \n[142]Are you gonna tell me where we're going? Why is the surprise for me? You're the one with something to celebrate. \n[143]I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it. \n[144]Wait.     There's more. \n[145]We have an audience.      Work with me. \n[146]Grab something. \n[147]I can't. I can't go in. \n[148]I know, but -- \n[149]I did. \n[150]I'm sorry. \n[151]I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore. \n[152]How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick. \n[153]Maybe I don't want it to be real. \n[154]What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining... ... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there. \n[155]She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry... \n[156]That's what makes it so bad. She always did what was right for me. I wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. Even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. I didn't care. It was my stupid dream and it killed her. All she wanted was for it to come true. \n[157]I know... but she... I just don't think I can do it without her. \n[158]Yeah.   I do. \n[159]Yeah.   For my mom. \n[160]See you tomorrow? \n[161]It hurts! I'm out of shape and it hurts. Okay? Satisfied? \n[162]Practice. \n[163]I don't get in shape like that. But it's still a good spot. I got my application for Juilliard. Just in time too. They're holding auditions in Baltimore next month. \n[164]I'll never be ready in a month. \n[165]Mojo? \n[166]You don't understand. Ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. I used to practice two, three hours every day. I'm so far behind... \n[167]It's not as easy as that. My free form still sucks. It's still the weakest part of my routine. That hasn't changed. \n[168]You will? \n[169]Let's skip. Later. \n[170]standing where she can see but can't be seen from the dance floor. From a curtain of kids, Malakai suddenly appears at her side. Sara can't move. She's boxed in. Malakai indicates Nikki and Patrick with slick satisfaction, whispers derisively: \n[171]What? \n[172]He's in D.C. Blues Alley.   He'll be gone all night. \n[173]Roy's demo. The only one he ever cut. Kinda grows on you. \n[174]Wanna see my room? \n[175]Sorry... \n[176]Excuse me? \n[177]Whose motto? \n[178]Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too. \n[179]I don't have a favorite. \n[180]I dunno. Maybe cymbidiums -- orchids. They're sort of show- boaty but they're pretty. \n[181]Agua. \n[182]Mmm.    Mauve. \n[183]Nut.   What are you talking about? \n[184]Why does he have to leave?   We're all adults. Right? \n[185]I hate being your daughter.    You ruin everything. \n[186]You mean it because he's black. \n[187]Why's it bullshit? Because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for Angela Bassett? \n[188]Keep telling yourself that. Just don't expect me to believe it. I saw how you looked at him. But you didn't see him. Well, for your information, he's a straight- A student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have! \n[189]Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts. \n[190]I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare. \n[191]How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years! \n[192]Over? I don't even know why it started... bitch. And don't say it's about Patrick because it's not. It's not about him. \n[193]I like him, he likes me. And if you don't like that, screw you. \n[194]I got suspended. Two days. \n[195]I'm not sure. I think it's some kind of black female thing. \n[196]It's alright.    I'm okay. \n[197]Look.  It's not a good time. I'll see you later... I'm okay. \n[198]Want me to take him? \n[199]I'll get 'em. \n[200]No.   I explained about Nikki. \n[201]She started it, Chenille. She wanted to start it. I told you what she said. \n[202]So you agree with her? You think I don't belong with Patrick. \n[203]We like each other. What is the big fucking deal? It's him and me. Not us and other 'people.' \n[204]There's only one world, Chenille. I thought we were friends. Guess I was wrong. \n[205]I gotta get home. Ready? \n[206]Fuck you. \n[207]We should keep going. \n[208]I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time. \n[209]I can't work like this.      I can't dance like this. \n[210]Like this.     You dictating to me. \n[211]Nothing's wrong. I can't figure things out. \n[212]Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them. \n[213]Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around. \n[214]Everything's screwed up. Nobody wants to see us together, not even Chenille. I don't know why they feel that way. How can I know? Maybe they have a point, Patrick. \n[215]I'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all. \n[216]Why are you getting mad? \n[217]You're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to Malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over. \n[218]I know he's lost, Patrick! Everybody but you can see that. And if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too. \n[219]They weren't rednecks! \n[220]The hell with you too! \n[221]Hi. \n[222]Toni, listen carefully. You're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole. \n[223]I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to. \n[224]Uh-huh.   The big day. \n[225]You're not so bad. I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter. \n[226]I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. \n[227]I wanted somebody there who loves me. \n[228]finishes with a flawless arabesque.      Looks out. \n[229]Yes... sir... they have... my music. \n[230]Yes.  Emo... Emotion. \n[231]stands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges, her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky whisper. \n[232]I'm sorry. I wasn't ready.       Can you start it over again? \n[233]I'm ready. \n[234]Thank you.   Very much. ", "PATRICK": "\n[1]White folks back then felt safe. Capote scared 'em. He took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in America's back yard. That's what makes the book special. \n[2]That's all of it. Capote wasn't first. Richard Wright and James Baldwin did the same thing. Wasn't nobody tryin' to read them though. \n[3]Lots of people like who?      You? Hello. Didn't think so. \n[4]playing cards with Snookie at one of the picnic tables. He glances up to see Sara. Glowering at him. He grins. Sara rolls her eyes, turns away.      Mutters loudly to herself. \n[5]Gotta work. \n[6]You already fired my ass, Nikki. Once and done. Over. Out. 'Bye. \n[7]Hit me and shut the hell up. \n[8]Why you sweatin' me, Snookie? \n[9]What happened to you at lunch, man? \n[10]So you're hangin' in, man? Feelin' strong about being back? \n[11]You gonna stay though.   Right? \n[12]You up for some hoops after school? Break your free-throw back in. Chump the chumps like we used to. \n[13]I got my own problems, Snook. \n[14]I ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if I don't get in and I'm not in 'til I get my letter. \n[15]That's too big. \n[16]I wouldn't do that if I were you. \n[17]Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand. \n[18]I misread the component. \n[19]Feetz ain't no square dance. \n[20]Let's not. \n[21]How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it? \n[22]It ain't anymore, Nikki.     Not to me. \n[23]Bad choice.      'Anything.' \n[24]Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really drank. \n[25]What's that mean? Whatever. \n[26]Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still. I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me. \n[27]But you do know how...? \n[28]... Let's do it then.    C'mon. \n[29]Now move your hips. Not so fast. Sara! Just like our hands. 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.' \n[30]pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. Only then does he look over at Malakai who, eyes engorged with rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping him with no signs of letting up. Patrick can see Malakai's too far gone for talk. He rushes him from behind, nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor. \n[31]Man, what the hell are you doin'? Tryin' to get sent back up? \n[32]You couldn't let it slide? \n[33]Malakai, you fuck up parole, you ain't gonna back to JuVee. Eighteen and up, that's Jessup. Hardcore lockdown. You want that? \n[34]Well, you definitely got the stompin' part down. \n[35]For damn sure, man. \n[36]Chenille. I heard you the first five hundred times. \n[37]It's not okay, okay? Come on, Braveheart. \n[38]What? \n[39]Why you keep lookin' at me? \n[40]That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'. \n[41]I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there. \n[42]My friend was in trouble. \n[43]She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and thin. So, how'd you like Feetz? \n[44]Once you got used to the music. \n[45]Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time. \n[46]We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water? \n[47]You passed it. \n[48]No problem. \n[49]Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again? \n[50]Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again? \n[51]Okay. \n[52]You do the shit to yourself, man. The bomb in your shell? \n[53]Thank you, Snookie. \n[54]On my way.   Soon as I get outta here... \n[55]Throwin' a party? \n[56]Well, you were fly anyway. Last night. Dancin', I mean. \n[57]Nobody's as fly as me. \n[58]Maybe we could hook up later. After school or somethin'. Work on some of your moves. If you want. \n[59]By the way, Hammer's pretty much played out. \n[60]I got it. \n[61]Actually, I call it a car wash. The work I do, yeah, that's a job. \n[62]You hangin' with him now?    Think that's a good idea, 'Kai? \n[63]You could try layin' all this shit off for awhile. Give yourself a chance on the other side. \n[64]You know what I mean. It ain't like you don't have good sense. \n[65]I know that, Mrs. Gwynn. \n[66]Feel the groove. Don't let the music mess with you. \n[67]Who said I wanna be a doctor? \n[68]Keep it tight.     Watch your butt. \n[69]Pediatrics. I like kids.         Come on, stay with me. You're slackin'. \n[70]No.   Do you? \n[71]Wouldn't be the first time. \n[72]What was that shit you just did? \n[73]You used to dance? \n[74]Why not? \n[75]That's why you brought it up. Did that whole relieve thing. 'Cause you don't wanna talk about it? \n[76]Yeah, we can concentrate. But I think it is a big deal. Whatever it is you don't wanna talk about. \n[77]What y'all doin' to my nephew? \n[78]Didn't you like it when you 'used' to dance? \n[79]Let me guess. You don't wanna talk about it. \n[80]I stole a bike here once. \n[81]'Cause I didn't have one. \n[82]I used to do wild shit like that. \n[83]Yep.   Most of the time. \n[84]We're not. \n[85]Doesn't make me different from him. Not the way you think it does. \n[86]What you mean by scary? 'Kai's tough. He has to be. He still got a good heart. I know. \n[87]Let me finish. Me and him got into some shit awhile back. Real bad shit. We held up a gas station off 95. I bailed the ride -- jumped out the car. 'Kai kept goin', got caught. I knew what he was gonna do that night. Knew the car was hot. I woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if Malakai had served my name up. But he didn't. \n[88]He did his time plus most of mine. I owe him that. \n[89]We all mess up. Maybe Malakai gave up. But he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. I ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else. \n[90]Gangsta' Sara.     Stole a hat.   Call the F.B.I. \n[91]I think I'll wait for you to surrender. Were you tight with your mom, Sara? I mean, y'all get along and shit? \n[92]So she meant something to you. How come you never talk about her? \n[93]Know why there's nothing to say? Because you don't talk about her. You won't talk about her. \n[94]Why not?    If it helps. \n[95]And you call Malakai scary. \n[96]We can celebrate together. \n[97]I like it.   I love it.    Thank you. \n[98]Work with you? \n[99]Surprise... Sara? \n[100]You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet. \n[101]But what? \n[102]I thought you would like it. \n[103]You ain't actin' like you did. \n[104]Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent. \n[105]I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real. \n[106]It's not your fault it rained or she died. Or that you danced. That's what you were there for. Your mom would've expected you to do what you did. \n[107]You still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, Sara. She wouldn't want you to give up. \n[108]Do you want to do it, Sara? I mean you. Do you want Juilliard? \n[109]Then it's on you to make the dream come true. \n[110]For her.   For you. \n[111]Lemme see that move you did.     That cute leg relieve thing. Come on, Sara. \n[112]That's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape? \n[113]This is the perfect spot for that. You can run around and I can sit under the trees and watch you. \n[114]That's great! \n[115]Sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself. \n[116]Negative shit. White folks call it karma. The bad kind. \n[117]Quit whinin' and catch up then. \n[118]So I'll help you with it. \n[119]Yeah. I'll help you. Tell me what you need to do and let's get busy. \n[120]Nobody's watchin' you but me. \n[121]unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and wild. \n[122]Sara...? \n[123]I'm sorry. \n[124]How can a piece of shit tell? \n[125]Back out my business, boy. \n[126]How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made time for this bullshit, didn't I? \n[127]Y'all hangin' tonight or what? \n[128]Eastside?   That's the wrong side. \n[129]I ain't messin' with those fools over there. You know how they are. \n[130]That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem. \n[131]How you know? You ain't tried nothing else. Now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. You askin' for trouble, Malakai. You think this shit's funny? \n[132]Fuck you, Lip. I know what's out there. I also know you can get past it. But that ain't gonna happen, 'Kai, long as you keep gettin' in your own way. \n[133]What's your favorite flower? \n[134]Yeah, but if you did... \n[135]What's your favorite color? \n[136]What's your second favorite color? \n[137]You're makin' this real hard, Sara. Those ain't exactly tuxedo colors. \n[138]I was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since I'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me... \n[139]Chill, man. I'm goin'. You don't have to come off with all 'at. \n[140]Druid Hill?   Hell yeah. \n[141]I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings. \n[142]Pretty bad. Can't even play a got-damned game of ball no more. \n[143]Shit! \n[144]I thought you had somethin' to say to me. \n[145]Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki? \n[146]What if she is? What's it to you? You didn't see me trippin' off that Howard dude and I could have. I coulda tripped hard, Nikki. \n[147]How you gonna call it different? \n[148]You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki. \n[149]I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her. \n[150]It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself. \n[151]How many times you gonna ask me that? \n[152]Even if I did ride, you ain't got nobody but Lip and Lip will get a nigger's ass killed. Quick. \n[153]That shit ain't funny. \n[154]Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you! \n[155]'Cause you wrong, Malakai! \n[156]You messed up. \n[157]No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time. \n[158]Like what? \n[159]What's wrong, Sara? \n[160]What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there. \n[161]I didn't know there was a 'them.' \n[162]They only got a point if you believe they got a point, Sara. \n[163]That's a fuckin' 'nough. \n[164]Because I like to think for myself, run my own life, and I thought you did too. \n[165]First of all, Malakai ain't never fucked me over. Second of all, you don't know him, Sara, what he been through. Matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. So don't come off to me like you do. \n[166]Who the fuck are you to say he's lost? Malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends. \n[167]You know what?     The hell with you. \n[168]Thought you might need this on Saturday. I ain't gonna be able to make it. \n[169]They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again. \n[170]Malakai... ... When it's on, I'll be there. \n[171]I don't care what you said, Chenille. \n[172]It's besides the point. Whatever point it is you tryin' to make. \n[173]I gotta go. \n[174]He's not a fool, Chenille. \n[175]I still gotta go. Check you later. \n[176]Pull over. This ain't helpin' nobody, 'Kai. I'm out. I mean it. Stop the car. \n[177]What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to! \n[178]Yes, sir.    She's ready. \n[179]You can do it. Ain't nobody watchin' you but me. \n[180]All due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy! ", "CHENILLE": "\n[1]That's how easy it is to give to charity around here. Don't put your shit on the floor. \n[2]Yeah. It's Sara. And you're boring her from the ears down. \n[3]You finished? \n[4]Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings. \n[5]A dance. \n[6]Asshole beaucoup. In this crowd, you gotta be more specific. \n[7]I don't know about cute but he is smart. Real smart. Real trip, too. \n[8]Patrick Reynolds? Hell yeah, I know him. He's my brother. \n[9]That's your old man? Now he's cute. \n[10]Yeah.   He is. For you. \n[11]Why?   Your hand busy? \n[12]You must be lookin' in your dreams. \n[13]It's in the mail, Patrick.       Okay? \n[14]That time? What? Fifth and sixth grade don't count? \n[15]Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that? \n[16]This is Diggy.     Thinks she's down. \n[17]So, Sara.   What's up with that? \n[18]You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only. \n[19]Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in. Yo, Snook \n[20]She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars. \n[21]You gonna pay the man or what? \n[22]So we'll hook up at my house. Go together. I will have your I.D. \n[23]Slammin'.   Slammin' outfit. \n[24]Yeah.  You look okay. Moma Dean. I'm leavin'. \n[25]Grandmom, Sara. Sara, Grandmom. Also known as Momma Dean. And handsome here is Christopher. \n[26]He sure ain't Momma Dean's. \n[27]... He'll be one in July. Best mistake I ever made. Kenny -- Christopher's father -- he's the worst. Triflin'. Okay? \n[28]She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop. \n[29]Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your jacket. Give it here. \n[30]It's country. You look country in it. Take it off. \n[31]Rope dopes.   C'mon. \n[32]Too fine to stand in line? \n[33]Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody. \n[34]Snook hooks me up whenever he dees. \n[35]Got what? \n[36]anything but the squeeze on his balls \n[37]That's how I thought I had it. See ya. \n[38]Yeah.   And they started with you. \n[39]Quit it, Nikki. \n[40]Oh, no. Uh-uh, wench. You did not just call me a Negro. \n[41]I can say a lot more. Keep runnin' your mouth, Nikki. I'll lay all your shit bare. \n[42]'Cause I can't stand her ass and the way she played my brother. I need a drink, Sara. Let's walk. \n[43]That's him.        Comin' over.   Kenny? Don't look. \n[44]Where's my money, Kenny? \n[45]It's comin'?    No. You lyin'. \n[46]Rum and Coke.    No ice.   Hook me up. \n[47]... Yeah, I'ma tell you. Tell you like I keep tellin' you, Patrick. You need to let Malakai alone. Let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it. \n[48]I'll see you Monday. He'll walk you. \n[49]No, it's not okay. Would you tell the girl it ain't okay? \n[50]Beauty school. \n[51]I'm a year behind 'cause of my baby, but I'm gonna work during the day, go to school at night. That's my plan anyway... \n[52]He's a baby.   They cry. \n[53]He don't know you, Kenny. \n[54]Come around more often. \n[55]And I can't depend on you! Am I askin' you to do anything for him you ain't supposed to do? \n[56]-- I want you to pick up some of the slack. You always have an excuse. \n[57]You wanna talk about tied up? Try gettin' up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin' up with him when he's sick and havin' to drag your ass to school the next day. \n[58]It ain't good enough, Kenny! \n[59]How's Arvel? \n[60]You see Sara? She alright? You didn't hear? Nikki jumped off at her in gym. It was fierce... \n[61]What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser? \n[62]Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him. \n[63]Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son. \n[64]That wench. You gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list. Triflin' bitch. \n[65]So your old man flipped about the fight. Probably thinks it's all Patrick's fault. \n[66]Right. You put it all on her. None of it's on you. \n[67]Maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. But she had a reason to say what she said. \n[68]What I think don't matter. But you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. Like it don't hurt people to see. \n[69]Black people, Sara. Black women. Patrick's about somethin'. He's smart. He's motivated. He's for real. He ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. He's gonna do somethin' with himself. Here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. That's what Nikki meant about you up in our world. \n[70]Why you so quiet? Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you. \n[71]Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'? \n[72]I'm sayin' you can't help who you love, Patrick. At least you found somebody who loves you back. \n[73]To where? To who? Malakai? You ain't through with that fool yet. \n[74]No. You know what? You're the fool, Patrick. You think you let Malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. Ain't no blame or shame in that. \n[75]I shouldn't have... I was trippin'. \n[76]I know I come down on you hard about money, but I would rather you spend the time. Seriously. \n[77]I didn't say all that. \n[78]Yeah.   I always knew that. ", "ROY": "\n[1]Hi. \n[2]Have a good ride? \n[3]Guess you got stuff.    Baggage. \n[4]Looks like they're unloading. -- You hungry? We can stop somewhere if you want. \n[5]I didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. I wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. I mean, I could've hung around. Helped you say good-bye. That's what you were doin', wasn't it? \n[6]That's what I figured you were doin'. \n[7]Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy. Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right? \n[8]Fell through. \n[9]Not much of what you're used to. But the water's hot and the fridge is full. And I made room in the closets for you. Girl's gotta have closets, right? You even get your own bed. I'll crash on the couch. \n[10]Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check it out. On the other side. \n[11]Of course I have a phone. \n[12]Things change. You've changed. You grew up on me. Overnight. \n[13]Are you alright, Sara? I just wanna know how you feel. \n[14]Phone's in the kitchen.   Knock yourself out. \n[15]School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk. \n[16]Not around here you don't. Not until you get the hang of things. \n[17]I called about your transcripts. You're all set. Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program. No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school -- \n[18]Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art. \n[19]Maybe I ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but I'm playing. \n[20]S'alright. Hell, I wish I had half the time I wasted gettin' wasted. But those days are over. You'll see. I got my life on track. \n[21]-- Pick you up. Three-thirty. \n[22]How'd it go? \n[23]Hey, Sara.

Well, I think you were just leavin'. \n[43]He either leaves or I throw his ass out. Your call, Sara. \n[44]Who the hell are you to tell me how to come off? You're in my house alone with my daughter. \n[45]Siddown. It's a free country, you can hate me. Ain't like that's exactly news. But disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, Sara. I don't want him up here again. I mean it. \n[46]Don't start that bullshit! \n[47]Because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter! \n[48]Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara? \n[49]Sounds like you have it all figured out. \n[50]Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is. \n[51]What the hell happened to you? \n[52]For what? Fighting? Why were you fighting, Sara? \n[53]I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck. \n[54]I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara. \n[55]Tomorrow's the big day? \n[56]You bummed out about it? You're a worse liar than I am father. \n[57]Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by. \n[58]You want him there. I understand that.
