{"dialogues": {"JULIE": "\n[1]Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a year since my last confession... \n[2]I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I... \n[3]I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then... \n[4]You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't. \n[5]I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me. \n[6]You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it. I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis... \n[7]You know? But how could you... \n[8]I'm sorry -- \n[9]I'm fine. \n[10]I'm fine. \n[11]I had another dream, Will. \n[12]It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me. \n[13]I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months. \n[14]It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school. \n[15]It was one year ago... \n[16]I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place. \n[17]Right. Now I remember. \n[18]Are you getting out of town on the fourth? \n[19]I'm okay. \n[20]Thanks for the talk, Will. You're good to me. \n[21]Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me. \n[22]Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him. \n[23]Ray, we're just friend. \n[24]Why are you being like this? \n[25]Ray, I can't... \n[26]I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand... \n[27]It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't. \n[28]Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do. \n[29]Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while. \n[30]Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just scared...that's all. \n[31]Okay. Okay. Face your fears... \n[32]There's nothing... \n[33]Quiet. \n[34]Okay, calm down, imagination. \n[35]I can't take this anymore. I can't. \n[36]Let's just do it. \n[37]What are you doing in my closet? \n[38]What are you doing in my closet? \n[39]That was heart attack time, Karla. \n[40]I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. \n[41]I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. \n[42]There's nothing between Will and me. \n[43]No I'm not. \n[44]Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. \n[45]No. \n[46]Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- \n[47]Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? \n[48]What? \n[49]Ben... \n[50]That could break the machine. \n[51]The number's unlisted... \n[52]Okay, okay. You're right. \n[53]...South America...Carnival... \n[54]Hi. \n[55]No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- \n[56]It's okay. \n[57]Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. \n[58]We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know... \n[59]It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free! \n[60]Ray, come on. I want us to be together. \n[61]Will you try...for me, please? \n[62]Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye. \n[63]He's not coming. I thought he was just... \n[64]But, he said he'd try. \n[65]He does work hard. \n[66]Then, don't. \n[67]Oh! \n[68]You know what? This rocks. We're going to the Bahamas! \n[69]Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. \n[70]Deep breaths -- \n[71]You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning. \n[72]I'm the King of the World. \n[73]I will, and you remind me of the same thing. \n[74]It's pretty remote here. \n[75]Where is everyone? I'll ask -- \n[76]It sure is a beautiful old hotel. \n[77]Your what? \n[78]We haven't exchanged anything. \n[79]Storm season? \n[80]It beets being on the mainland. \n[81]Why's that? \n[82]Karla! You promised. \n[83]Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore. \n[84]Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- \n[85]I miss Ray...I tried to call him. \n[86]I'm Julie. This is Karla. \n[87]backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER. She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her. Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them. \n[88]Don't even think about it. \n[89]No way. \n[90]No. \n[91]Not me...no way... \n[92]You asked for it. Song number thirty-nine. \n[93]First I was afraid...I was petrified... \n[94]I will survive...I will survive... \n[95]And I still know...what you did... last summer... \n[96]It's...him. \n[97]He did something to the screen...it, it, said... \n[98]Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry... \n[99]There's no way...just stop it right now... \n[100]Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic. \n[101]Oh, Will! I'm sorry. \n[102]No, no, no. This was really sweet... \n[103]No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. \n[104]Are you sure? I really appreciate it. \n[105]Will...? \n[106]Will? \n[107]Is that you? \n[108]It's happening again! There's a body! \n[109]It's in my room! \n[110]There was a body! I swear it! \n[111]I wasn't dreaming. \n[112]Listen to me. He's here. \n[113]I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there. \n[114]The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. \n[115]I want off this island. \n[116]Then I'll call the mainland for a charter. \n[117]It's dead. \n[118]looks out the window with glazed-over eyes. \n[119]Some. \n[120]It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too. \n[121]Nice move. \n[122]Cancer in a box. \n[123]Houseplant. \n[124]Karla! \n[125]You say something? \n[126]Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny. \n[127]Oh, God, get me out. Get me out. \n[128]I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help. \n[129]We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. \n[130]Ben Willis. \n[131]They never found the body. \n[132]Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up -- \n[133]Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. \n[134]I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job. \n[135]It's not him. \n[136]Voodoo. \n[137]Leave him alone. \n[138]Let him go. I believe him. \n[139]He's telling the truth. He could've easily killed me. He didn't. Look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...This whole thing was a setup. \n[140]Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose. \n[141]I don't know. \n[142]How do we know you're not? \n[143]We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. \n[144]Did he do it? \n[145]I've got to see. \n[146]I'm not dying on this island, Will. Do you hear me? \n[147]You want me, Ben Willis? Come and get me. I'm right here. \n[148]My grave stays empty! \n[149]Then, we fight -- \n[150]Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. \n[151]I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault. \n[152]Wait, it's Nancy -- \n[153]Get used to it. \n[154]There's no way to lock it. \n[155]You sick freak. \n[156]Karla! \n[157]He's inside. \n[158]Come on... \n[159]Nancy... \n[160]No way!! \n[161]Move! \n[162]Come on, gimme a shot -- \n[163]Come on, you can make it. \n[164]I'm right here. Grab my hand. \n[165]Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla, just get my hand. \n[166]No, you're not. \n[167]All right -- \n[168]Did you get help? \n[169]What happened? \n[170]He's in it with Willis? \n[171]Your stomach, you're hurt -- \n[172]Oh, my god, you're bleeding to death. \n[173]We need a first-aid kit. \n[174]Will, just hold on. We'll get you fixed up. \n[175]You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound. \n[176]Why are you doing this to me? \n[177]I trusted you. \n[178]...Why? \n[179]\n[180]No, no, no -- \n[181]stands behind him holding the gun. \n[182]Just...Die. \n[183]You're okay. Thank god. \n[184]We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret. \n[185]Ray...what are you doing? \n[186]Never do that again. \n[187]I love it here. \n[188]You know me to well. \n[189]What is my problem? ", "KARLA": "\n[1]I thought you were out of town! \n[2]I thought you were out of town! \n[3]i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! \n[4]No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. \n[5]And we're going to put away the utensils and you're coming with me. \n[6]Yeah, right -- whatever. \n[7]Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. \n[8]Yet. Nothing yet. \n[9]What we gotta do is keep moving. No time to mope. I'm working at the club tonight. And you, dancing queen, are coming with me. \n[10]Fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed. \n[11]I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. \n[12]If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. \n[13]Ask her to dance. \n[14]Go on. \n[15]Say yes. \n[16]No means yes. \n[17]Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. \n[18]Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin' fine. \n[19]Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. \n[20]Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact. \n[21]It's Tyrell. \n[22]Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt. \n[23]I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty. \n[24]Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning. \n[25]Well, I'm in school and -- \n[26]Yes! \n[27]Brazil? Um... \n[28]You don't know?! You have to know. You know everything... \n[29]Still here...thinking...

And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins. Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date. \n[34]You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? \n[35]That boy has got fish on the brain. Hey, cheer up, Charlie. We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah... \n[36]Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire. \n[37]Julie, you left four messages... Four. \n[38]He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! \n[39]Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so... \n[40]Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too.

That'll be just fine with us. \n[54]Wait...Did you say off-season? \n[55]Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip. \n[56]Oooh, the mainland -- \n[57]We won a competition. \n[58]Rio, baby! \n[59]Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here. \n[60]I also promised Tyrell. \n[61]He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But... \n[62]Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours. \n[63]For the next foury-eight hours... Your smile is a frown...turned upside down. \n[64]They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.

And going to Wall Street. \n[75]'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. \n[76]Jacuzzi. \n[77]I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if it's just so you can pull it off. \n[78]You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? \n[79]Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. \n[80]Don't you get feisty... \n[81]I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle. \n[82]Ty! \n[83]How's Julie? \n[84]Your not out yet, slugger.

How many pairs you got in there? \n[100]Julie! \n[101]I think we can classify this as an emergency situation. \n[102]We gotta get out of here. Now. \n[103]There were boats here? Refresh my memory, there were boats... \n[104]Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. \n[105]Julie... \n[106]Julie, we have to do something. \n[107]Julie, where are you going? \n[108]Come on, Julie. You saw his room. \n[109]What do you mean? \n[110]I know I don't want to stay in here. \n[111]Be careful, Julie. \n[112]...Today's July fourth. \n[113]Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down.

Hide in a tree? \n[117]I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. \n[118]It's too late for that. \n[119]You think that's a good place to hide? \n[120]Ty! \n[121]What do we do? \n[122]Oh, god, no -- \n[123]Oww... \n[124]It's locked! \n[125]Please!

There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. \n[2]Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you. \n[3]I'll talk real slow. \n[4]You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules. \n[5]That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise. Wanna dance? \n[6]Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me. \n[7]Where I come from, you want to snatch the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first. \n[8]Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical? \n[9]Is there a problem here? \n[10]Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining. \n[11]Can't talk right now. \n[12]Are we there yet? \n[13]I feel like I'm still on that thing. \n[14]I can get used to this. \n[15]Yes, ma'am. \n[16]Not possible. \n[17]I'll scare somebody up. \n[18]Whoa! \n[19]Nice dog. \n[20]What's your problem, buddy? \n[21]Okay, we get it...It's old. \n[22]We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. \n[23]Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical! \n[24]Guess the capital of Brazil -- \n[25]Promised me what, baby? I made all my promises to William. \n[26]Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you? \n[27]Tell me this ain't the bar scene. \n[28]Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai? \n[29]The last day of the season.

Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode. \n[51]See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason? \n[52]I'm just saying what all of you are thinking.

I don't give a crap about you're fisherman. There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- \n[75]Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first. \n[76]Yo, Freak Boy -- \n[77]We're gonna find some weird crap in here. \n[78]I told you. \n[79]Missing a hair tie? \n[80]We found our guy. \n[81]We gotta find flashlights, torches, guns if they got 'em, anything that'll help. \n[82]Wait.

You need something that'll get his attention. \n[93]Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum. I should've been listening to you...

Are you okay? \n[10]Are you sure? \n[11]Um...Okay. Bye. \n[12]This was not my idea. \n[13]I said, this...Do you want a drink? \n[14]How about a drink? \n[15]You okay? \n[16]Hey Julie? \n[17]Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... \n[18]What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second. \n[19]Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all. \n[20]Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. \n[21]You just gotta breathe. \n[22]See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can't sail. \n[23]Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother. \n[24]No, thanks. \n[25]And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. \n[26]Forward! A girl needs time to make up his mind. Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon. \n[27]I'll take those. \n[28]You sure it's okay with you? \n[29]You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand. \n[30]We didn't get all dressed up for nothing. \n[31]The guy at the desk said the place would be quiet, not dead. \n[32]So why are you still here? \n[33]Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! I'll drink to that! \n[34]Come on, it'll be fun. \n[35]Julie? What's wrong? \n[36]What do you mean, Julie? \n[37]who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The bottle bursts and covers them with spray. \n[38]It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think... \n[39]I scared you -- I crossed the line -- \n[40]Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off. \n[41]I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy. \n[42]Dork. \n[43]How's the water? \n[44]Ahh, that feels great. \n[45]Alone. In the room. Got any advise? \n[46]What? What are you talking about? Where? \n[47]Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. \n[48]Leave her alone. \n[49]You don't have to be a jerk. \n[50]They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. \n[51]Hello? There's nobody here, Tyrell. \n[52]You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- \n[53]I don't like to fish. \n[54]looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link. He looks up at Tyrell. \n[55]Come on. Jump. I've got you. \n[56]And do what with it? \n[57]That's chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two together and you get cyanide. \n[58]Julie! \n[59]Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? \n[60]The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- \n[61]He's not here. \n[62]Let's go. \n[63]We'll only be a second, okay? \n[64]We found your voodoo crap -- \n[65]How do we know you're not setting us up? \n[66]Where'd Estes go? \n[67]I'll go find him. \n[68]He's probably the only one who can help us. \n[69]It's okay. He couldn't have gone far. I'll catch up with you later. \n[70]Hey Estes. Estes? Where'd you go? \n[71]You abandoning us? How come you didn't tell us you had a boat? \n[72]What -- ? \n[73]pokes his head through. He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon. \n[74]It's you guys, thank god. Is everyone okay? \n[75]Come on. We're gonna be okay. \n[76]Estes came after me with a gaffing hook. \n[77]I guess so. \n[78]When I was coming back I saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water. Let's hurry and get inside... \n[79]You'll be okay. It's over. \n[80]That's because it's not my blood. \n[81]It's time you woke up, Julie. \n[82]\n[83]Look at the bright side, Jules. We finally get to spend some quality time together. \n[84]Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend. \n[85]We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right. \n[86]What'd you have to do that for? \n[87]Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son. \n[88]Hi, Dad. \n[89]You gotta be kiddin' me. \n[90]We haven't missed you down here, Ray boy. I got to know Julie real well. \n[91]Think of all the things I'm gonna do to her. Dad, finish him. ", "RAY": "\n[1]steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints. \n[2]I got in early.

I've got the old truck. You know the drill...Crab boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen Pageant...It's only small-town fun, but it's still nice. People really miss you. I miss you. \n[6]Can't what? \n[7]I understand something. \n[8]I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too. \n[9]You know where to find me. \n[10]It's okay. I'm just gonna go. \n[11]Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. \n[12]No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... \n[13]What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. \n[14]This weekend? \n[15]You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? \n[16]Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. \n[17]Okay, I'll try. But, listen... If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. \n[18]Stupid. Stupid. \n[19]You wanna see what I've been thinking? \n[20]I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming. \n[21]No. \n[22]Maybe not. \n[23]Hey! Buddy, what's up? \n[24]Hey, can you hear me? \n[25]\n[26]...Dave? \n[27]jumps off the edge of the road.

And throw that in, too. \n[32]I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring. \n[33]Is it loaded? \n[34]Load it. \n[35]I'll keep that in mind. \n[36]I need to get to Tower Bay Island. \n[37]I need to get there, now. \n[38]I'm not looking for a weather report, I'm looking for a boat. So which one's yours? \n[39]Come in...This is Summer Breeze requesting emergency assistance for Tower Bay island. I repeat...This is Summer Breeze... \n[40]Let go of her! Now! \n[41]like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree. Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him. \n[42]Let her go. Now. \n[43]Stop right there. \n[44]Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you? \n[45]Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. We got the refrigerator in. Come see. \n[46]It's gonna be great. \n[47]Checking the locks again?
