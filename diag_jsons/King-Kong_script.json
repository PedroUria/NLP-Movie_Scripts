I've come into possession of a map. The soul surviving record of an unchartered island, a place that was thought to exist only in myth ... until now! \n[7]I'm talking about a primitive world ... never before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most spectacular thing you've ever seen! That's where I'll shoot my picture! \n[8]Excuse me, boobies? \n[9]What are you - an idiot? You think they asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the film maker, they showed some class! Not that you'd know what that means - you cheap low-life! \n[10]Gimme that - quick! \n[11]Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business. \n[12]I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour. \n[13]Tell `em the studio's pressured us into an early departure. \n[14]hat are they gonna do - sue me?

Mae West? \n[26]Fay's a size four! \n[27]ooper huh? \n[28]Not an option. \n[29]I said I'd find a girl. \n[30]For Godsake, Preston - think like a winner. Call Jack ...

Will you take a cheque? \n[64]Jesus, Jack - you scared me! \n[65]Listen, if anyone comes to the door, don't open it. You haven't seen me ... say I got depressed and committed suicide. Say I stuck my head down a toilet! You want one? \n[66]What's this? \n[67]This is a script? Jack ... this is fifteen pages. \n[68]I'm supposed to be making a feature length picture. \n[69]Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I have a beginning but I need a middle and an end! I gotta have something to shoot. \n[70]Alright, fine. We might as well settle up. \n[71]I'm not going to stiff a friend. \n[72]How does two grand sound? \n[73]Thought it might. \n[74]Voila! \n[75]So I did ... Sorry about that Let's start from the beginning. \n[76]\"Two Thousand Dollars\" ... \n[77]It is the 29th, isn't it? \n[78]I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just take a second. \n[79]Alright ... okay ... \n[80]I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theatre. \n[81]You're much better off sticking with film. \n[82]o, you don't. \n[83]If you really loved it, you would have jumped. \n[84]Knock knock! We can't have our leading lady deprived of the necessities of life. Do me a favour - run a bottle down to Jack. It'll fend off his migraine. \n[85]You told him my typewriter is available for hire? \n[86]Jack has his heart set on coming. Call me a softie - I couldn't say no. \n[87]I don't care, Mike! You're the sound recordist - make it work. \n[88]Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you to the crew! This is Herb - our cameraman ... \n[89]Lumpy!

Stop - right there - \n[93]She's standing at the railing ... she doesn't know it yet, but they're sailing towards disaster. You got that? \n[94]ait a second, we're killing off the \n[95]Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone. \n[96]The point is: she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it. \n[97]The island. \n[98]Jack, keep your voice down! I don't want the crew getting spooked. \n[99]All right ... It has a local name, but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good. \n[100]They call it ... \n[101]There's nothing officially wrong with it.

And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that. \n[142]He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket! Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it, and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids. \n[143]Thank God. \n[144]ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl!
