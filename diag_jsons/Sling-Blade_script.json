{"dialogues": {"KARL": "\n[1]Well, I reckon what you're a wanting to know is what I'm doing in here. I reckon the reason I'm in here is 'cause I killed somebody. But I reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come me to kill somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start at the front and tell you.  I lived most of my life out behind my mother and father's house in a little old shed and my daddy'd built for me. They didn't too much want me up there in the house with the rest of 'em. I mostly just set around out there in the shed all the time a lookin' at the ground. It didn't have no floor but I had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or tow that I put down there.  My daddy was a hard workin' man most of his life, not that I can say the same fer myself. I most just set around the shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off and on from time to time but the children there made quite a bit of sport of me, made fun of me quite a bit. Some of 'em roughed me up sometimes so mostly I stayed out back there in the shed. My daddy worked down at the sawmill there, down there at the planer mill for an old man named Dixon. Old man Dixon was a very cruel feller, he didn't treat his employees very well, didn't pay 'em much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy much of a wage, just barely enough to get by on. But I reckon he got by all right, they come out one or the other of 'em, usually my mother, and fed me pretty regular. At least I know he made enough for me to have mustard and biscuits three or four times a week. Old man Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon. Jesse was really more cruel than his daddy. He made quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls around the neighborhood quite a bit.  He used to say my mother was a very pretty woman. He said it quite a bit from time to time, when I was at the school house. Well, I reckon you want me to get on and tell you what happened so I reckon I'll tell you. I was settin' out in the shed one evenin' not doin' too much, just kindly starin' at the wall and a waitin' fer my mother to come out and give me my Bible lesson and I heared a commotion up in the house there so I got up and run up on the screened-in porch there to see what was a goin' on, and I looked in the kitchen window and I seen my mother a layin' there on the floor without any clothes on.  And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on top of her having his way with her.  Well, I just seen red. I picked up a kaiser blade that was a layin' there by the screen door, some folks calls it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade. It's just a long handle like a axe handle with a long blade on it that's shaped kind of like a banana. Sharp on one edge and dull on the other. It's what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot. I went in the kitchen there and I hit Jesse Dixon up side the head with it and knocked him off my mother. I reckon that didn't quite satisfy me so I hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and just plumb near cut his head off. Killed him. Well, my mother, she jumped up from there and started yellin', \"What did you kill Jesse fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?\"  Well, come to find out my mother didn't really mind what Jesse was a doin' to her. I reckon that made me madder than what Jesse had made me. I takened the kaiser blade, some folks calls it a sling blade, I call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up side the head with it an' killed her.  Some folks has asked me if I had it to do over again would I do the same thing. I don't know, I reckon I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here and here I've been for a great long while. I've learned to read some; took me four years to read the Bible. I reckon I understand a good deal of it. It wasn't what I expected in a lot of places. I've slept in a good bed for a great long while. They've seen fit to put me out now. They tell me they're a settin' me free today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all you need to know. If you want any more details I reckon I can tell 'em to you. I don't know if that's enough for your newspaper or not.  Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.  \n[2]I don't reckon I got no reason to kill nobody.  \n[3]Thank you.  \n[4]I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.  \n[5]I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.  \n[6]I ain't got nothing but them books.  \n[7]All right then.  Karl walks slowly down the hallway.  \n[8]I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.  \n[9]You have any biscuits for sale?  \n[10]What you got that's good to eat?  \n[11]What do you like to eat here?  \n[12]French-fried potaters.  \n[13]How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.  \n[14]Give me the big'uns.  Karl digs in his pocket for money.  \n[15]What you got in there, warshing?  \n[16]Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?  \n[17]How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?  \n[18]I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.  \n[19]Karl's my name.  \n[20]Childers.  \n[21]Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.  \n[22]Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.  \n[23]I did live there in the state hospital.  \n[24]I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.  \n[25]Yeah.  \n[26]They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.  \n[27]I reckon I feel all right.  \n[28]I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.  \n[29]How does a feller go about gettin' up to the state hospital?  \n[30]All right then.  \n[31]I want to come back and stay here.  \n[32]I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.  \n[33]Naw.  \n[34]Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.  \n[35]I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.  \n[36]I reckon.  \n[37]I never was no good with history.  \n[38]I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.  They sit and stare at each other for a moment.  \n[39]No thank ye.  \n[40]I don't reckon I know nobody name Jerry.  \n[41]He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.  \n[42]Coffee makes me a might nervous when I drink it.  \n[43]Yes sir.  Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the edge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed still as it was the night before.  \n[44]Yes sir.  \n[45]Thank ye.  \n[46]I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.  \n[47]I like them french-fried potaters.  \n[48]I don't reckon.  \n[49]Yeah, they's good all right.  \n[50]They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.  \n[51]All right then.  \n[52]Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.  \n[53]You told me to come by.  \n[54]I ain't no good at it. I just come by.  \n[55]All right then.  He starts to walk away.  \n[56]I don't want to worry your mama with company.  \n[57]I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?  \n[58]Pleased to know y'all.  There's an uncomfortable silence.  \n[59]Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.  \n[60]I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.  \n[61]What's that you say?  \n[62]They turned me loose from the state hospital.  \n[63]I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.  \n[64]Not really to speak of.  Linda and Frank return from the back.  \n[65]Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.  \n[66]My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.  \n[67]He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.  \n[68]You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.  \n[69]How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?  \n[70]Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.  \n[71]Why did he do that, reckon.  \n[72]Yeah, I did.  \n[73]Two people.  \n[74]I thought they was.  \n[75]I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.  \n[76]That boy wants me to.  \n[77]I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.  \n[78]Yes sir.  \n[79]That boy wants me to.  \n[80]Naw, I ain't.  \n[81]Quite a spell, I reckon.  \n[82]I done et just a little bit ago.  \n[83]I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.  \n[84]Tolerable, I reckon.  \n[85]This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.  \n[86]Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.  \n[87]A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.  \n[88]I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.  \n[89]You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.  \n[90]He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.  \n[91]I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.  \n[92]I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.  \n[93]I like the way you talk.  Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight as we:  \n[94]I reckon not.  \n[95]Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.  \n[96]I've heard it said that way.  \n[97]I wouldn't never hurt them.  \n[98]I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.  \n[99]Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.  \n[100]Childers.  \n[101]I reckon.  We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near distance.  \n[102]No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me nervous when I drink it.  \n[103]I didn't aim to.  \n[104]No ma'am.  Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring.  \n[105]Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.  \n[106]Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?  \n[107]Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.  \n[108]Yes ma'am.  \n[109]Mustard's good on 'em to me.  \n[110]Thank ye.  \n[111]I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.  \n[112]I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.  She keeps working.  \n[113]Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.  \n[114]I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.  Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but not as much as you would think.  \n[115]Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.  \n[116]Yes sir.  \n[117]My history.  \n[118]I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.  \n[119]That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.  \n[120]Hit ain't got no gas in it.  \n[121]I reckon.  \n[122]I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.  \n[123]Yes ma'am, I reckon.  \n[124]I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.  \n[125]All right then.  He gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up and tries to catch up.  \n[126]I reckon.  They walk a little farther in silence.  \n[127]I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.  They walk until they disappear into the darkness.  \n[128]Thank ye.  \n[129]A blister shore can hurt.  \n[130]Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.  \n[131]Yeah.  \n[132]That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.  \n[133]Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.  \n[134]That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.  \n[135]Yeah.  \n[136]All right then.  \n[137]Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.  \n[138]Hit was right thoughty of her.  \n[139]All right then.  \n[140]Yeah, I recollect it.  \n[141]If you want me to.  \n[142]I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.  \n[143]They ort to. You're a good boy.  \n[144]Naw.  \n[145]That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?  \n[146]Pull on your works. Your privates.  \n[147]Yes sir. You ort not know that language.  \n[148]You ort not to pull on yourself that away.  \n[149]He ain't no count.  \n[150]I don't reckon I know.  \n[151]Naw.  \n[152]I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.  \n[153]Yeah.  \n[154]Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.  \n[155]My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.  \n[156]Yes sir. Right then it was.  \n[157]A little ol' boy.  \n[158]I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.  \n[159]I heared it cryin' a little through that box.  \n[160]I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.  \n[161]Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.  \n[162]I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  \n[163]Yes sir, I reckon it does.  \n[164]No ma'am.  \n[165]I reckon.  \n[166]I could shore use some. Thank ye.  \n[167]Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far. (he looks directly at Frank, which he seldom does You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?  \n[168]I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.  \n[169]Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.  They sit in silence for a moment.  \n[170]Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.  \n[171]I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.  \n[172]Yeah.  \n[173]Yessir.  \n[174]I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.  \n[175]Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.  \n[176]No sir.  \n[177]I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.  \n[178]If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.  \n[179]I'm ye boy.  \n[180]I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.  \n[181]They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.  No response.  \n[182]I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.  No response.  \n[183]That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.  \n[184]I learned to read some. I've read on the Bible quite a bit. I don't understand all of it, but I believe I understand a good deal of it. Them stories Mama and you told me ain't in there. You ort not to of done that to ye boy.  I've studied on killin' you. But I don't reckon they's no reason fer it if all you're gonna do is set there in that chair. You'll be dead soon enough I reckon and the world'll be shut of ye. (Karl walks toward the kitchen and turns back to the old man You ort not to of killed my brother. He ort to have had a chance to grow up. Sometimes he would of had fun.  \n[185]Little feller.  \n[186]I want to be baptized.  \n[187]I don't rightly know. I just kindly woke up a-holdin' it.  \n[188]Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.  \n[189]Don't hit that boy no more.  \n[190]No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.  \n[191]Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.  \n[192]He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.  \n[193]Ma'am?  \n[194]You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.  \n[195]You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.  \n[196]Thank ye. (Karl walks away, then turns I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.  \n[197]I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?  \n[198]I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.  \n[199]You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.  \n[200]That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.  \n[201]I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.  \n[202]Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.  He hands him the books.  \n[203]Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.  \n[204]I aim fer you to have 'em.  \n[205]Yes sir.  \n[206]Reckon what kind of a feelin'?  \n[207]Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?  \n[208]Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.  \n[209]Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.  \n[210]I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.  \n[211]This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.  \n[212]That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?  \n[213]Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.  Vaughan takes the bag.  \n[214]I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.  Vaughan watches Karl walk away.  \n[215]How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?  \n[216]What numbers do you punch?  \n[217]I aim to kill you with it.  Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.  \n[218]Yes ma'am. I need the police over here at the Wheatley house.  I've killed somebody with a mower blade.  Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I hit him two good whacks. That second time just plumb near cut his head in two.  Hits a little old yeller house right on the corner of Marigold Street and some other street. They's a red pickup truck out front says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION on it. I'll be a settin' here waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the police, Doyle said you might want to send a ambulance or a hearse. Thank ye.  He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the mustard jar and runs the knife around it. There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.  \n[219]They was a boy. We made friends.  \n[220]It's too big.  \n[221]Don't say nothin' about that boy.  Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.  \n[222]Fact the bidness, don't you say another word to me. I ain't listenin' to you no more.  Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the grass that separates him from the next building. He stares out the window, as we:  ", "FRANK": "\n[1]What's you last name?  \n[2]What are all them books?  \n[3]How come you're carryin' them around with you.  \n[4]Don't you live somewhere?  \n[5]Why'd you live there?  \n[6]They let you out?  \n[7]How come?  \n[8]Are you well?  \n[9]You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.  They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up the sidewalk.  \n[10]This is my house. You can just set those bags on the porch.  Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each other in silence for a moment.  \n[11]Do you like to play football?  \n[12]Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.  He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door.  \n[13]Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?  \n[14]Yeah. What you doin' by here?  \n[15]Did you want to play ball with us?  \n[16]Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.  \n[17]Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.  \n[18]Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.  \n[19]They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.  \n[20]Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.  \n[21]Yeah.  \n[22]I don't like potted meat. Daddy used to say it was made out of lips and peckers and intestints.  \n[23]Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.  \n[24]Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.  \n[25]Can we get some candy and pops?  \n[26]This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?  \n[27]They still around, your folks?  \n[28]How do you know?  \n[29]How did your mama die?  \n[30]I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now. (he looks at the ground for a moment Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.  \n[31]She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.  Pause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled.  \n[32]Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.  \n[33]It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.  \n[34]'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?  \n[35]Who did you kill?  \n[36]Were they bad people?  \n[37]Maybe they needed it.  \n[38]It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?  Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and doesn't answer.  \n[39]My daddy was good. I think too many good people die. It ain't right. That's what I think.  \n[40]He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.  \n[41]No sir.  \n[42]I ain't sure.  \n[43]I want to watch T.V.  \n[44]Hey. Y'all come on in.  \n[45]Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.  \n[46]Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.  \n[47]Stop it, Doyle!  \n[48]Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!  \n[49]Come on, Karl.  They get up and walk away.  \n[50]I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.  \n[51]Well, I hate him.  \n[52]Will you stay here with us for a long time?  \n[53]I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.  \n[54]I like the way you talk.  \n[55]I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.  \n[56]I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.  \n[57]I get nervous, that's all I know.  They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where this conversation could lead and know when to leave well enough alone.  \n[58]Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.  \n[59]They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.  \n[60]He ain't ever okay to me.  The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really happy.  \n[61]I hate you!  \n[62]You all right, Mama?  \n[63]We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?  \n[64]Did Vaughan go home?  \n[65]Did Karl go to bed?  \n[66]I bet he don't. Karl likes me.  \n[67]Mama?  \n[68]Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.  \n[69]Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?  \n[70]I love you, too, Mama.  He goes to his room.  \n[71]I just don't have anything to say about shoes.  Silence for a moment.  \n[72]Hey Karl, you off work?  \n[73]Where'd you get them flowers?  \n[74]I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?  \n[75]It's name's A Christmas Carol.  \n[76]You want to go with me?  \n[77]I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.  \n[78]Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?  \n[79]Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.  \n[80]I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.  \n[81]You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.  \n[82]Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.  \n[83]I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.  \n[84]I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?  \n[85]Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.  \n[86]And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.  \n[87]What do you mean?  \n[88]Oh, jackin' off?  \n[89]I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?  \n[90]I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.  \n[91]You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.  \n[92]And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?  \n[93]'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?  \n[94]Why not? It died?  \n[95]Why?  \n[96]So it died when it come out?  \n[97]It was alive?  \n[98]A boy or girl?  \n[99]You threw it in a trash barrel?  \n[100]It was still alive when you buried it?  \n[101]That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.  \n[102]That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.  \n[103]I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?  \n[104]Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.  \n[105]I always get nervous when I hear that doorbell. I'm okay just walkin' over, but somethin' about that dang doorbell. They have one room where you can't walk on the carpet or sit on the furniture. I don't see much sense in havin' it.  The door opens and we see an older black lady, the \n[106]Ma'am, I really want to give them to Karen.  \n[107]Will you get her for me. Please. I really want to see her. She'll want to see me, too, 'cause we're not in public. Just don't tell her folks I'm here.  \n[108]I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.  \n[109]I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.  \n[110]He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...  \n[111]Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.  \n[112]But maybe just for awhile --  \n[113]She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?  \n[114]He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.  \n[115]We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.  Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank.  \n[116]What you readin'?  \n[117]Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?  \n[118]I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.  \n[119]Is that right?  \n[120]You will? For sure?  \n[121]We'll be on teams, me and you?  \n[122]Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.  \n[123]We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.  He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up.  \n[124]Come on, let's kick off to 'em.  \n[125]I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.  \n[126]You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.  They walk in silence for a moment.  \n[127]It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?  \n[128]It was fun, anyhow.  \n[129]Can we play ever' Saturday?  \n[130]Yeah, I guess.  \n[131]Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --  Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm. Doyle shakes him off.  \n[132]Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?  \n[133]Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.  \n[134]You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.  \n[135]Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.  \n[136]Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.  \n[137]I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.  \n[138]You don't want to give away all your books.  \n[139]Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?  \n[140]I've got a feelin' today.  \n[141]Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?  \n[142]You know I would. Whatever you want.  \n[143]Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?  \n[144]Okay.  Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in the trees.  \n[145]Karl!  Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other through the trees.  ", "DOYLE": "\n[1]Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.  \n[2]Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?  \n[3]No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.  \n[4]I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?  \n[5]He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?  \n[6]You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.  \n[7]You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet. (takes a long pull on his beer Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.  \n[8]Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?  \n[9]Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.  \n[10]Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.  \n[11]Don't rush ever'body, honey.  She starts to get her things together.  \n[12]Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.  \n[13]I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.  \n[14]See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.  \n[15]So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to me.  Karl sits on the couch.  \n[16]Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.  Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl.  \n[17]What's in your bag?  \n[18]What's all them books?  \n[19]You believe in the Bible?  \n[20]Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?  \n[21]You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?  \n[22]You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.  \n[23]Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.  Frank is crying now.  \n[24]Don't tell your mama we had a little spat. She don't need to be worried with your ass.  \n[25]Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.  \n[26]Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.  \n[27]What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.  \n[28]You know what, by God?  \n[29]You know what we ought to do tonight?  \n[30]Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.  \n[31]You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.  \n[32]That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.  \n[33]Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.  \n[34]Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.  \n[35]Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! (they clap a little except for Karl  \n[36]On the bass, give it up for Terence \"One Ball\" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums \"The Johnson.\"  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here. (pauses for a slug of beer Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?  \n[37]Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!  They play \"Walk Don't Run\" while the audience of four sits in motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.  \n[38]You like that Vaughan?  \n[39]You enjoying yourself, Karl?  \n[40]I told you already three times, the laws on my side. I play cards with J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police. Get fucked you old bastard!  Okay now, Linda, you and the kid clean up and get a tarpaulin over this instruments. Me and the boys are goin' to the county line. We're out of liquor and beer. Come on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin' with us.  \n[41]Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.  \n[42]But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.  \n[43]Shhhh! This is the national anthem.  They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song goes louder.  \n[44]Not that you afflicted sons of bitches would know anything about it, but this is art.  They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on the passenger side and turns down the music.  \n[45]Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.  \n[46]Yeah.  \n[47]We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?  \n[48]Catch you later Freddy!  Doyle peels out and the music blares again.  \n[49]I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?  \n[50]Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.  \n[51]You got that shit right.  \n[52]See Vaughan, you shouldn't question a genius. Morris is a modern day poet like in the old days.  \n[53]If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.  \n[54]We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!  \n[55]I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.  \n[56]Now!  They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit frozen on the sofa.  \n[57]Get out of my goddamn face, you fuckin' buzzard!  He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in the doorway.  \n[58]I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.  \n[59]You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.  \n[60]That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.  Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.  \n[61]You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.  \n[62]I thought I told you to keep out!  \n[63]Don't tell me what to do.  \n[64]Don't tell me what to do.  \n[65]Don't tell me what to do.  \n[66]Don't tell me what to do.  She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty cans, bottles, a lampstand. He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost pitiful.  \n[67]Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.  \n[68]Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.  He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as does Vaughan.  \n[69]Well, I'll be damned, there's the boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell, I'll just start over, set down you boys.  They do, on the couch.  \n[70]Well, what it is is, I just, well I took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk. I guess you'd say I'm really here to apologize, which ain't easy for me to do, about the way I acted the other night. I was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another. I care about y'all a lot, I do. I don't mean to be so damned, assholish I guess the word would be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit you, did I? So no apology needed there I guess, but Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama. I'm just jealous of her. I don't like her life or the way she runs it. I don't like homosexuals and she buddies with one. I don't like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' mental retards and she's got one of each livin' with her.  I was just kiddin'. But really I guess people need to get along even if they have differences.  You see, I work construction. I build things. Do you realize how important that is to the world. I have a lot of pressure on me. The upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot more time over here and we're gonna get along. Like a family should.  I may even surprise you one day and pop the question.  Well, I'm goin' back to work. I just wanted to give y'all some little piece of happiness today.  See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a good boy, Frank.  He leaves.  \n[71]What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.  \n[72]Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.  \n[73]What are you doin' with that damn hammer?  \n[74]How'd your baptizin' go?  \n[75]Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?  \n[76]Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.  \n[77]I really just wanted to git your mama out of the house for a minute so we can have a talk. Y'all set down.  They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.  \n[78]Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?  \n[79]You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.  Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in his chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the garage.  \n[80]Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.  \n[81]Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.  \n[82]I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.  \n[83]Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police you push 911. You'll need to tell 'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're gonna kill me.   Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear one short dull thud.  \n[84]Oh God! Oh God!  We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood on his face, hand and shirt.  ", "LINDA": "\n[1]Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?  \n[2]Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?  \n[3]Nice to meet you, Karl.  \n[4]Frank come back here with me for a minute.  She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.  \n[5]Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.  \n[6]I know.  \n[7]Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.  \n[8]He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.  \n[9]I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.  \n[10]Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.  \n[11]He's just mentally retarded, I guess.  \n[12]Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.  \n[13]He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.  \n[14]You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.  \n[15]Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.  \n[16]Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?  \n[17]Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?  \n[18]Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?  \n[19]Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.  \n[20]How come Karl won't eat here with us?  \n[21]I just feel sorry for the poor thing.  \n[22]He does make some funny noises.  \n[23]I'm glad of it, honey.  \n[24]What?  \n[25]Please Doyle, don't.  \n[26]Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.  \n[27]Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.  \n[28]He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.  \n[29]No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.  \n[30]Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.  Karl claps his hands a little.  \n[31]He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.  \n[32]This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.  \n[33]You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.  \n[34]That might be better than this.  \n[35]Leave.  \n[36]Leave.  \n[37]Leave.  \n[38]Leave.  \n[39]I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.  \n[40]No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?  \n[41]What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.  \n[42]Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.  \n[43]I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.  \n[44]I know he does.  \n[45]Huh?  \n[46]Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.  \n[47]I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.  \n[48]You scared me.  \n[49]Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?  \n[50]I'll be dog.  More silence.  \n[51]Right now?  \n[52]Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?  \n[53]Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.  \n[54]Okay.  Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits.  \n[55]It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?  \n[56]Vaughan's \"friend\" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.  \n[57]That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?  \n[58]Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?  \n[59]I believe you. I really do.  \n[60]Why don't we talk about something a little more festive.  \n[61]Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?  \n[62]Vaughan, don't get pushy.  \n[63]Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin' much, you boys must really like that food.  \n[64]That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?  Nods, grunts, \"Sure do's.\"  \n[65]Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.  \n[66]Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.  \n[67]I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.  \n[68]You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?  \n[69]What do you want, hun?  \n[70]We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.  \n[71]It went real good.  \n[72]Would y'all like that?  \n[73]All right, y'all gonna go with me?  \n[74]I'll be back in a little bit then.  She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.  \n[75]Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?  \n[76]Well, okay. I got you some.  \n[77]Where'd he go? What's goin' on?  \n[78]All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.  \n[79]Yeah.  \n[80]Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.  \n[81]We sure like havin' you.  ", "WOOLRIDGE": "\n[1]Oh yeah, from the college?  \n[2]My name's Jerry Woolridge.  \n[3]Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?  \n[4]I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?  \n[5]Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?  \n[6]The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.  \n[7]I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.  \n[8]He has problems. You know. With all that. He won't hardly talk to anybody really. Just certain people. He's very troubled.  \n[9]I don't think he's talked to a woman in twenty-five or so years. That I know of anyway. That's why I said to send a man. At least maybe he'd answer a question or two for a man. I'm all for helping the college out, believe me. It might be a real good article or story.  \n[10]Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.  \n[11]I'll talk to him and see what we can do.  \n[12]You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?  \n[13]His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--  \n[14]I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says \"Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1.\" He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.  \n[15]One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.  \n[16]Karl, you know, do you remember when I told you about those people from that newspaper?  They want to ask you some questions about your release. They think it would make an interesting story. Will you talk to 'em? Get interviewed.  Now, they're women. I think it might be good for you to. You're gonna be seein' all kinds of people when you go on the outside. This'll help you I believe.  \n[17]Well, it surprised the dickens out of me. He said he'll talk to you.  Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.  \n[18]But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.  \n[19]It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.  \n[20]He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.  \n[21]Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.  Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in. In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions for Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless. Woolridge whispers to Theresa.  \n[22]You'll have to step outside.  Theresa starts to protest.  \n[23]Please.  Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like forever.  \n[24]We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.  \n[25]I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.  \n[26]Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.  \n[27]As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.  Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he speaks to Marsha.  \n[28]Yes, I guess you are.  \n[29]You better go get your things.  \n[30]You better go get 'em.  \n[31]Karl, what in the world are you doing here?  \n[32]Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.  \n[33]Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?  \n[34]Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?  \n[35]Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job. (they sit in silence for a moment You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?  \n[36]I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?  \n[37]I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.  \n[38]No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.  \n[39]She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.  \n[40]Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama tonight. I'll sleep with your brother and Karl can take your room.  \n[41]We have company. Now you go on.  \n[42]Well, Karl, there's plenty of blankets and things there. Bathroom's right there in the hall. We'll leave first thing tomorrow.  Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books. Woolridge closes the door.  \n[43]Yeah, I thought about that. No sense in moving him now I guess.  \n[44]Why, hell no, son. What's wrong with you?  \n[45]Karl, you up?  \n[46]Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?  \n[47]Well, I guess we better hit the road.  \n[48]Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?  \n[49]No, don't guess I do. (he shakes hands with Scooter who sort of smiles Scooter, good to meet you. (Woolridge leans in and gets confidential This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.  \n[50]Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted these days. I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.  \n[51]He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.  \n[52]Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate it. He needs the job. I don't know what to do with him. He don't have anybody really.  \n[53]He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?  \n[54]He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.  \n[55]Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss. (Karl obediently shuffles over This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.  \n[56]That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to the car and get your books.  Woolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl stares at the floor.  \n[57]How are you, Bill?  \n[58]Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.  \n[59]Is him stayin' here workin' out?  \n[60]Can I see him?  \n[61]Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?  \n[62]Do they know about you?  \n[63]Yeah.  \n[64]I'll be.  \n[65]I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.  They walk over to Bill.  \n[66]I'll see you, Bill.  ", "VAUGHAN": "\n[1]Let me guess. You want a bunch of candy and a pop.  \n[2]You're gonna rot your teeth that way. But I bet I know what you would like even better. I put potted meat on special, four cans for a dollar and they're not moving very well. I'd sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy.  \n[3]Can I help you, sir?  \n[4]I don't think I've ever seen you before.  \n[5]It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?  \n[6]What brings you back?  \n[7]Why are you here now?  \n[8]Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?  \n[9]Do you have family here?  \n[10]He just got out of the state hospital.  \n[11]Sure, go ahead.  They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little puzzled.  \n[12]Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?  \n[13]He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.  \n[14]What about me?  \n[15]Karl is a guy guy?  \n[16]Karl?  Karl turns to face Vaughan.  \n[17]So, you're really going to stay here?  \n[18]Did you knock on the door yet?  \n[19]How long have you been standing here?  \n[20]Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?  \n[21]I mean tomorrow or the next day.  \n[22]Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.  They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a moment, Frank answers the door.  \n[23]Sure, I guess.  \n[24]I know Albert. We're friends.  \n[25]That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.  \n[26]Yeah, I knew that. You're a card all right.  Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave.  \n[27]Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind. (pauses for a response, instead Karl eats french fries and stares at the table I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?  \n[28]Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.  \n[29]Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?  \n[30]Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?  \n[31]That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?  Karl looks up and stares for a moment.  \n[32]Oh. How about before that?  \n[33]Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.  \n[34]I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.  \n[35]Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.  \n[36]Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.  \n[37]What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.  \n[38]I don't get it.  \n[39]I don't really understand the meaning of the words.  \n[40]It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.  \n[41]Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.  \n[42]I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.  \n[43]I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.  \n[44]Does everyone like the food?  Nods and yeses.  \n[45]Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.  \n[46]Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.  \n[47]I'm sorry.  \n[48]Or the kind old ladies who work in the school cafeteria wear.  \n[49]Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.  \n[50]Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.  \n[51]Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.  \n[52]Yes.  \n[53]Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.  \n[54]Okay.  \n[55]What's wrong? Is everything okay?  \n[56]Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?  \n[57]What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?  ", "BILL": "\n[1]Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.  \n[2]Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?  \n[3]I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.  \n[4]Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.  \n[5]Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?  \n[6]That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.  \n[7]Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.  Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with laughter.  \n[8]Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.  \n[9]Good to know you, Karl.  \n[10]Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.  Karl doesn't say anything.  \n[11]They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.  \n[12]We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.  \n[13]Yeah, me too.  \n[14]All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.  \n[15]Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?  \n[16]If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.  They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.  \n[17]Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?  \n[18]There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, \"Boy this water's cold.\" Old boy from Arkansas says \"Yeah, and it's deep too.\"  Get it? That's a goodun.  \n[19]Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door. (Karl takes the key and keeps eating french fries Them french fries good?  \n[20]You got any money?  \n[21]Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.  \n[22]I'll let you off while it's still daylight.  \n[23]Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.  \n[24]All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?  \n[25]You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.  \n[26]How 'bout you, Jerry.  \n[27]Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?  \n[28]Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.  \n[29]He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.  \n[30]Sure.  Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on new mowers in the front window.  \n[31]Scooter! Run get Karl for me.  \n[32]Karl, see if you can figure out what's wrong with this thing. It won't crank up and ever'thing seems to be put together right.  Karl squats beside the tiller.  \n[33]Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.  Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.  \n[34]See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.  \n[35]Hey Karl, they's somebody out here to see you. Some gal holding a nice bouquet.  Come on now, she wants to talk to you. Don't just set there.  Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter. Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody says anything for a moment.  \n[36]Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.  \n[37]Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.  They start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at Karl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the counter. They are silent for a while.  \n[38]Hey there Karl, can you come unload a generator for me?  Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside.  \n[39]Karl, lift this thing down and carry it to the back. It's on the blink. (to man as Karl unloads it We'll have it for you in a day or two, Walter.  \n[40]Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a bulldozier. Fix anything, too.  He's mentally retarded, but he's a whiz on small engines. Lord works in mysterious ways.  Karl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles his hair.  ", "MARSHA": "\n[1]In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?  \n[2]Do you smell shit?  \n[3]Yes sir.  Woolridge shakes hands with them.  \n[4]Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.  \n[5]Yes sir.  \n[6]Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.  \n[7]No thank you.  \n[8]Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.  \n[9]No, we have to get this story.  \n[10]Why won't he talk to women?  \n[11]Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.  \n[12]I knew he slept in a toolshed.  \n[13]Before they were married?  \n[14]That's really strange. What does it mean?  \n[15]How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?  \n[16]Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.  \n[17]Signs?  \n[18]Will you ever kill anybody again, Karl?  This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking straight at Marsha.  \n[19]Is he leaving right this minute?  \n[20]I didn't mean that.  \n[21]Where will he go?  \n[22]Will he be supervised?  \n[23]Thank you.  Karl doesn't take her hand.  Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.  ", "BOY": "\n[1]Can I help you?  \n[2]Well, what did you want?  \n[3]Naw, we don't have biscuits.  Karl stands in silence for a moment.  \n[4]Did you decide, sir?  \n[5]Well, I guess it's all good.  \n[6]French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.  \n[7]Yeah.  \n[8]Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.  \n[9]These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.  \n[10]Yeah.  \n[11]I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.  \n[12]About a half a mile I think it is.  \n[13]Okay. You don't have to though.  Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.  \n[14]My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?  ", "MELINDA": "\n[1]Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.  \n[2]I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.  \n[3]I get real mean when my feet hurt. It's the only time I don't like checkin' out the customers, when my feet hurt.  \n[4]Why?  \n[5]You mean about y'all bein' together in \"that\" way?  \n[6]I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.  \n[7]You walk fast, don't you?  \n[8]These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?  \n[9]Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These was on sale 'cause they're not fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus my ten percent employee discount. Since I didn't bring you anything to our date last night, I thought you'd like to have 'em.  She hands them to him.  \n[10]Well, I just thought I'd give you them. I liked walkin' with you. I got a blister the size of a quarter on one heel. Well, I'll see you sometime, I guess.  She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say something.  \n[11]Yeah.  \n[12]Me, too.  She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers and watches her walk away.  ", "MORRIS": "\n[1]Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow me on those particular points, but it's not really important in the smaller picture, which is where most people dwell anyway. Not that being manager of Ben's Dollar Store is insignificant. Or that making it through years of incarceration in a state supported facility is any small feat.  \n[2]Holidays are for campers.  \n[3]Anything that has to be discussed can't mean anything.  \n[4]Exactly the point, my young levelheaded friend.  \n[5]I rest my case.  \n[6]Not unlike Gary Brooker of the Protocol Harum.  \n[7]Our latest composition is as follows: entitled: \"The Thrill\" -- \"I stand on the hill Not for a thrill but for a breath of a fresh kill Never mind the man who contemplates doing away with license plates He stands alone anyway Baking the cookies of discontent By the heat of a laundrymat vent Leaving his soul\" (Then like in poetry I have dot dot dot then drop down to the next line kind of off center. \"Leaving his soul parting waters Under the medulla oblongata of mankind.\"  Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at something other than Morris.  \n[8]The dots are where I say they are. Melody and tune. That's your trade. You're a tunesmith Terence.  \n[9]The dots just look good on paper. You don't sing 'em anyway. You're showing your true Aries colors now.  ", "CHARLES": "\n[1]A Mercury is a good car and that's what I was driving that day. I've owned a lot of cars. Different kinds. Lots of different kinds of cars. She was standing, this girl, on the side of the street where there was a chicken stand; not the Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless a chicken stand, and I pulled the Mercury over and rolled down the window by electric power. She was wearing a leather skirt and she had a lot of hair on her arms. I like that. I like it a lot. It means a big bush. I like a big bush. She said, \"Are you dating?\" I said, \"yes,\" and she got in the car. We pulled to a remote location, one that she and I both felt comfortable with and she said, \"How much can you spend?\" I said, \"What it takes to see your bush. I know it's a big one.\" She said \"twenty five dollars,\" which to a working man is not chicken feed. I produced the money and she put it in her shoe and pulled up her skirt. There before me lay a thin, crooked, uncircumcised penis. You can imagine how badly I wanted my twenty-five dollars back.  \n[2]There was a young man named John Liggit Hunter who was in the filling station business and a good filling station business. He was one of those young men that we run across so often in life. I'm sure you've run across them, that didn't deserve the things he had. One of those things was his beautiful bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia Peach. As a matter of fact she looked more like the picture I've had in my head than any woman I've ever seen. I took it upon myself to take her away from John Liggit Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm not sure if I mentioned that he was a Frenchman who claimed to be an Englishman. It took some very strong nylon cord to take her away from him. She was a fighter as well as a Georgia Peach.  \n[3]A shovel just makes too goddamn much racket.  \n[4]You have to make something explode to truly understand it. You have to examine the tiny particles while they're on fire.  Off screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and see MELVIN the guard.  \n[5]... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.  \n[6]I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.  \n[7]Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details. ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?  ", "SCOOTER": "\n[1]And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I always wanted to kill him myself. Asshole's what he was. I remember that ol' boy  too. Kind of retarded or somethin' back in school.  \n[2]I don't guess. Can he talk?  \n[3]They make a good double meat burger.  \n[4]Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.  \n[5]I can't remember.  \n[6]Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.  \n[7]I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.  ", "THERESA": "\n[1]I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.  \n[2]Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.  \n[3]Yeah.  They reach a door and the guard ushers them through.  \n[4]Let's just go, Marsha.  \n[5]I thought you'd be happy to leave.  \n[6]Can I just sneak in there? I won't take any pictures, I promise. I just want to listen.  ", "TERENCE": "\n[1]I think y'all play really tight together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't throw off on one another.  \n[2]Morris is real smart with philosophies and things. That's why him and me are the songwriting team of our group. I make up good tunes or melodies as we call them and Morris is the lyrics.  \n[3]We wrote one last night standin' outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it \"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car.\" Then, you know, like on country songs in parenthesis it says \"There is usually someone in the trunk.\" I came up with a tune just humming.  \n[4]I don't think that's right. I believe dot dot dot come between medulla and oblongata or something like that.  Well it did. It wadn't before mankind, I know that much.  \n[5]That wadn't the way you made it up before, Morris. That's all I know.  \n[6]What about our instruments?  Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.  ", "KAREN": "\n[1]Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.  \n[2]They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.  She eyes Karl.  \n[3]Why? Hi, Karl.  \n[4]Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.  She proudly displays the ring.  \n[5]Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.  \n[6]I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.  She closes the door. They stand therefor a moment, then walk away down the sidewalk.  "}}
