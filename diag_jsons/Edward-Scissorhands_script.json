Now what did I do with my sci... Edward, um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor friend who I think could help you.  \n[25]Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to consult the Avon handbook before doing anything.  \n[26]Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it would make you feel if somebody were staring at you.  \n[27]Well, I would, so don't do it!  \n[28]I think he prefers Edward.  \n[29]I was just...  \n[30]Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank you.  \n[31]Would you like some butter for your bread?  \n[32]Great.  \n[33]I've had enough.  \n[34]You think you can sleep? Things feel strange now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good night.  \n[35]The light concealing cream goes on first, then you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the secret. More concealing for you? But you complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and start with a completely smooth surface. Don't eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on  \n[36]They filled the whole tape.  \n[37]Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.  \n[38]Oh, Edward.  \n[39]Edward, don't you listen to her.  \n[40]Hi, Joyce. Hi!  \n[41]No, it, it's... things have just been a little hectic around here. That's all.  \n[42]Barbecue?  \n[43]What time? Ah... bill.  \n[44]I've always said that you really can't have a picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs. They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh, dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know you chopped all those things. What a really big... Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda won't be here and the rest of neighbors there are really very nice. There's no need to be nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You just have to be yourself.  \n[45]That's right. Just your own sweet self.  \n[46]He did them just like that.  \n[47]Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are you hungry? Do you want a cracker?  \n[48]Honey, that was Edward.  \n[49]Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing to be upset about. No, no. It's okay.  \n[50]Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow we'll fix your room right.  \n[51]Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all alone. You would have done the same thing.  \n[52]Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He can't help the way he is. Have a little sympathy.  \n[53]Then let's just say hello and later you can come downstairs and shake his hand.  \n[54]Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him half to death.  \n[55]Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a proper introduction. Edward, this is our daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going to live with us.  \n[56]Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had lunch at Jackie's today.  \n[57]She's just had her kitchen completely redone.  \n[58]New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher.  \n[59]Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me your mom had her kitchen done too?  \n[60]My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be that rich.  \n[61]Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today.  \n[62]Honey, you want me to help you clean that up?  \n[63]It won't be long. She has just to decide on the style, and then it will be fine. She just has to decide what style she wants.  \n[64]We're getting the head of the company.  \n[65]Hi, honey. We're in here.  \n[66]Edward cut it. Isn't it wild? Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's right here. Great. So then you know all about it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using. Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye bye. No wonder she's the head of the company. You know, she started out as a sales representative just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her but until now I never had a reason. Thanks, Edward.  \n[67]You bet she did.  \n[68]No matter what, Edward will always special.  \n[69]I've never seen that.  \n[70]Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without you. Here you go.  \n[71]Wouldn't that be great?  \n[72]You know. We already have a second on the house, but don't the testimonials make a difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife can't wait to become a client?  \n[73]I can't believe it. Really, it's just an outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of it. We'll get your money somewhere.  \n[74]But can we see him now?  \n[75]He has to stay in prison all night?  \n[76]Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself.  \n[77]Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I envied Jim's parents, their money.  \n[78]Oh, I blithely say, \"We'll get money for the salon somehow.\" But I never meant stealing. Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's not the way to get anything.  \n[79]Why ever did you do this?  \n[80]Edward. You stay here.  \n[81]He didn't want to talk.  \n[82]He can't talk right now.  \n[83]We have to get in the house. We don't want to talk to you. We'll talk to you later.  \n[84]Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at our Christmas party. Before I get you here for your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well, you may think that, but you're wrong.  \n[85]Kim!  \n[86]Simmer down.  \n[87]You are not seeing Jim tonight?  \n[88]Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think your father's finished yet.  \n[89]Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you should do, bit it's not.  \n[90]Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't learn right from wrong living in his family.  \n[91]Edward, do you want to give me that new haircut?  \n[92]yes, sure.  \n[93]It makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser.  \n[94]Other people's feelings?  \n[95]A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you cut away. Cut away. It needs something else. What do you think, honey?  \n[96]More bells. Okay.  \n[97]Of course I think we should be having this party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we need is just to calm things down and then everything will just go back to normal. Do you have any more bells, honey?  \n[98]You...your father will find him this minute.  \n[99]All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little cut.  \n[100]Oh... Uh...  \n[101]Oh, dear.  \n[102]I'm sure your father will find him soon.  \n[103]It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh?  \n[104]So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward down here to live with us, I really didn't think things through. And I didn't think about what could happen to him, or to us, or to the neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it might be best if he goes back up there. Because at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back to normal.  \n[105]Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the car and go look for him.  \n[106]He's Max'es.  \n[107]We'll be right back, dear.  \n[108]Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all right? Let just leave him alone!  ", "KIM": "\n[1]I can't believe. Everything's still sopping.  \n[2]I told you to call to say we're coming back early.  \n[3]They don't run their house like a police station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See you later.  \n[4]Don't forget your arm.  \n[5]Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill me.  \n[6]Who is he? What are you talking about?  \n[7]Mom, why did you have to bring him in here?  \n[8]Why does he have to stay here?  \n[9]I do have a little sympathy.  \n[10]Shake his hand?  \n[11]I scared him to death?  \n[12]Hi!  \n[13]I think they look weird. They give me the creeps.  \n[14]Oh, no!  \n[15]Stop it.  \n[16]No, that's okay. I'll be right back.  \n[17]I'm home.  \n[18]Hi! What did you do to your hair?  \n[19]No, I can't believe this. Do you have a key?  \n[20]I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere.  \n[21]Wow! Thanks.  \n[22]Now you got him started.  \n[23]Why are you laughing? He got hurt.  \n[24]A little shock?  \n[25]But that's breaking and entering.  \n[26]We can't.  \n[27]Jim, I don't want to.  \n[28]Why can't you just do it?  \n[29]Why can't you take the key like when he's sleeping or something?  \n[30]What do you mean?  That's not true.  \n[31]That's not fair.  \n[32]There got to be.  \n[33]Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on.  \n[34]You turned off the alarm. Am I right?  \n[35]I can't believe this is happening.  \n[36]He's never been here.  \n[37]No, Jim. We can't just leave him here.  \n[38]Denny, turn around!  \n[39]Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell them we were breaking in.  \n[40]We have to go back.  \n[41]His own son?  \n[42]Denny, turn around.  \n[43]Turn around. We have to.  \n[44]You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they? Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back, but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you for not telling them about me.  \n[45]It must have been awful when they told you whose house it was.  \n[46]You did?  \n[47]Well, then why did you do it?  \n[48]Don't.  \n[49]You could tell the truth.  \n[50]It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do it.  \n[51]Dad!  \n[52]That is really stupid.  \n[53]Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley? That will be fun.  \n[54]No.  \n[55]Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do.  \n[56]I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do.  \n[57]Shut up.  \n[58]More bells?  \n[59]Mom, do you really think that we should be having this party?  \n[60]Where is he?  \n[61]No, he did not and you know it.  \n[62]Jim.

I hope he's okay!  \n[67]With you guys.  \n[68]Edward?  \n[69]Yes, are you okay?  \n[70]Out looking for you. Hold me.  \n[71]Let go of me! Why? Kevin!  \n[72]Jim, stop it. Get off him!  \n[73]Run.  \n[74]No, he's okay. He said he was just scared. Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were dead.  \n[75]Jim. Stop!

Bye.  \n[4]Oh, yeah.  \n[5]He's calling you, Kim.  \n[6]Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you.  \n[7]Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four heads.  \n[8]No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My father has his own room for his stuff to make sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he won't help me buy my own car.  \n[9]Ah, that's true, sir. You can't.  \n[10]You got it?  \n[11]Well, we're stranded.  \n[12]Ed, what a guy! Good job.

Right, Kim?  \n[14]Knock it off, bubble- butt.  \n[15]So?  \n[16]It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha!  \n[17]I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left nut to see that again.  \n[18]Look.

There's a guy who will give us cash for the stuff.  \n[20]Well, do you want to ride around in a van like Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever we like? With a mattress in the back?  \n[21]Because my father keeps the damn room locked, and we need Edward to get us in.  \n[22]Look, you don't understand, everything he handcuffs or ties will do anything for you.  \n[23]Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?  \n[24]What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any other way.  \n[25]Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us to have our own van?  \n[26]Those go on automatically. They've gone for the weekend. I told you. That's right.  \n[27]Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on.  \n[28]Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it. Right? Come on. Let's go.  \n[29]Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on.  \n[30]The bastard had it wired separately. Come on.  \n[31]No way!  \n[32]I'm not going back there. Okay?  \n[33]No, because my father will prosecute.  \n[34]Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll kill him.  \n[35]No.  \n[36]What's the matter with you? When you are going to stop? I did what I could. My old man think he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail.

Freak!  \n[40]He tried to hurt you.  \n[41]Are you nuts? I just saw him.  \n[42]Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that? He isn't even human.  \n[43]Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he could do other places.  \n[44]Later, first take me to her house.  \n[45]Just do it!  \n[46]Just drive.  \n[47]I didn't.  \n[48]Hey! I said stay away from her!

You can't buy car with cookies. Am I right, Jim?  \n[24]Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the dash board.  \n[25]So, Edward, did you have a productive day?  \n[26]Great.  \n[27]Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty parlor, that's what's going to teach you volumes. There's nothing like running your own business.

Although you may not realize it since they haven't made a commercial on the subject.  \n[3]On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't want to miss a moment of it.  \n[4]Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see there's a vehicle in my driveway?  \n[5]Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that means I'm busy.  \n[6]Yes, I'll be right there.  \n[7]You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old hermit crabs.  \n[8]Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of you.  \n[9]Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct the situation. What time does the barbecue begin?  \n[10]Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality by introducing him to your friends, don't you?  \n[11]And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time was it that you said?  \n[12]About five?  \n[13]Did you hear that? He's the perversion of nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you later. Bye bye.  \n[14]Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold? Just think what a single snip could do.  \n[15]Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're... What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad that I made especially for you. Allow me.  \n[16]Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my house first.  \n[17]Haven't you, Eddie?  \n[18]Eddie. Thirsty? Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear myself think. Momma's precious little baby girl. Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of lemonade?  \n[19]I was hoping for something big and bouffant. Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses. You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear. Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair? Would you cut mine? That was the single most thrilling experience of my whole life.  \n[20]Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect. It's just what we've been looking for. I want to call it \"Shear Heaven.\" Here we are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics. All along this row here.  \n[21]Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the customers. Back in here is what I really want to show you. This is the storeroom for supplies. What I need from you today is to help me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous. You just sit down right there. I have some smocks. Would you like me to model them? This is my favorite because it's yellow. And what it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that fall down your neck. Then there's this old purple one, you know, you kind of drape around you like this.  \n[22]You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward, you come back here! You can't do that!  \n[23]All along I felt in my gut. There was something wrong with him.  \n[24]I know, I know. They've got that teenage daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things after what happened to me can you imagine?  \n[25]I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm going! No! That's not a good idea!  ", "KEVIN": "\n[1]I wouldn't care.  \n[2]Man, those things are cool. You know I bet they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's neck...  \n[3]Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday?  \n[4]You hear that, Mr. Boggs?  \n[5]Dad, look!  Sports announcements on  \n[6]Edward, come here.  \n[7]Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us.  \n[8]One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over. They're the sharpest things in the world. They can hack through anything. And...  \n[9]You did it.  \n[10]I keep the money.  \n[11]You know we had a cool show-and-tell today. This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10. maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all.  \n[12]You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give it to the police.  \n[13]Hi, honey. honey.  \n[14]No.  \n[15]It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.  \n[16]I'll be outside.  \n[17]See you tomorrow. Call me, Right?  \n[18]Who?  \n[19]Help! Edward help!  \n[20]Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help us! Help!

You know that?  \n[4]Hello.  \n[5]Did you get a good look?  \n[6]She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell early this morning.  \n[7]Oh, damn!  \n[8]Or undo.  \n[9]It could have been any of our houses.  \n[10]I don't have anything against Bill and Peg, but...  \n[11]What do you say to Peg about the Christmas party?  \n[12]I lied, too.  \n[13]Edward! I'm calling the police!  \n[14]Yes, look.  \n[15]He's a de... a demon.  ", "OLD KIM": "\n[1]Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.  \n[2]Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.  \n[3]Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.  \n[4]Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would have to start with scissors.  \n[5]Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once there was even a man who had scissors for hands.  \n[6]Yes.  \n[7]No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top of the mountain?  \n[8]Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. He also created a man. He gave him inside, a heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost everything. You see, the inventor was very old. He died before he got to finish the man he invented. So the man was left by himself, incomplete and all alone.  \n[9]Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.  \n[10]She never saw him again. Not after that night.  \n[11]Because I was there.  \n[12]No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would rather want him remember me the way as I was.  \n[13]I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he is. You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up there now, I don't think it would be snowing. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.  ", "MARGIE": "\n[1]Hi, it's Margie. Listen, I was standing outside talking to Carol and Peg drove by, she had somebody in the car.  \n[2]No, did she say anything to you, about having guest?  \n[3]No, ok, I'll meet you on the corner.

Are you going?  \n[10]He practically raped Joyce, you know threatening her with those knives? It's a miracle she escaped.  \n[11]I said I hoped.
