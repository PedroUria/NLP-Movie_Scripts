He's an irresponsible, selfish... \n[21]Jack Frost is many things, but he is not a Guardian. \n[22]Hello, mate. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 29. \n[23]Been a long time.

", "PITCH": "\n[1]Ohhhh, I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn. What an adorable dream! \n[2]And look. At. Her. Precious child. So sweet, so full of hope and wonder. Why, there's only one thing missing...a touch of fear. \n[3]Hahaha! That never gets old! \n[4]Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right. \n[5]Yesss. What a pretty little Nightmare. \n[6]Now, I want you to go tell the others the wait is over. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 28. \n[7]Don't look at me like that, old friend. You must have known this day would come. My Nightmares are finally ready. Are your Guardians? \n[8]I have to say, this is very, very exciting. \n[9]The Big Four, all in one place. I'm a little star-struck. Did you like my show on the globe, North? Got you all together, didn't I? \n[10]Or what? \n[11]You'll stick a quarter under my pillow? \n[12]Maybe I want what you have. To be believed in. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 48. \n[13]Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds. \n[14]Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit! \n[15]Hang on, is that...Jack Frost? Since when are you all so chummy? \n[16]Oh good. \n[17]A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now. \n[18]Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 49. \n[19]Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a while to perfect this little trick. Turning dreams into Nightmares. \n[20]Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. They smell fear you know. \n[21]Oh, the Dark Ages. \n[22]Everyone frightened. Miserable. Such happy times for me. Oh, the power I wielded! \n[23]But then the Man in the Moon chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light! \n[24]Lifting their hearts! And giving them hope! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 50. \n[25]Meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream! \"Oh, there's nothing to be afraid of! There's no such thing as the Boogeyman!\" \n[26]Well that's all about to change. \n[27]Oh look, it's happening already. \n[28]Children are waking up and realizing the Tooth Fairy never came. \n[29]I mean such a little thing, but to a child... \n[30]Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch. If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they. \n[31]No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in! \n[32]The lights...why aren't they going out? \n[33]They're collecting the teeth? \n[34]Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a pillow with you! \n[35]Fine, have your last hurrah. For tomorrow, all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 62. \n[36]Frost? \n[37]You know, for a \"neutral party\" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos. This isn't your fight, Jack. \n[38]Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 70. \n[39]Now this is who I'm looking for-- \n[40]Whoa--?? \n[41]Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what- \n[42]You can have `em back! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 71. \n[43]Boo! \n[44]Pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air, leading another wave of Nightmares after the Guardians. \n[45]Pitch rises from behind a group of Nightmares. He stretches his arms as an ARROW of NIGHTMARE SAND forms behind him. \n[46]Pitch takes aim and releases the arrow. It flies through the air and into SANDY'S back, exploding on impact. \n[47]Sandy feels the shock and turns around. A patch of blackness starts slowly spreading across his body. Pitch laughs as he and Sandy lock eyes. \n[48]Hahahahaha!...Don't fight the fear, little man. \n[49]Pitch relishes this moment of triumph. \n[50]I'd say sweet dreams, but there aren't any left. \n[51]Is beyond delighted. His plan actually worked! Pitch then notices Jack flying towards him, glowing energy emanating from Jack's staff. Pitch raises his hands and sends a massive wave of Nightmares toward Jack. \n[52]Pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand. \n[53]\n[54]Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN! \n[55]Looking for something? \n[56]Don't be afraid, Jack. I'm not going to hurt you. \n[57]Maybe not. But you are afraid of something. \n[58]I know so. It's the one thing I always know. \n[59]People's greatest fears. Yours is that no one will ever believe in you. \n[60]And worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why. Why you? Why were you chosen...to be like this? \n[61]Well fear not, for the answer to that... \n[62]Is right here. \n[63]Do you want them, Jack? Your memories? Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 90. \n[64]Everything you wanted to know... \n[65]...in this little box. \n[66]Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone. You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think. \n[67]You're afraid of disappointing them. Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really. \n[68]After all, you're not one of them. \n[69]Of course I do. You're Jack Frost. You make a mess wherever you go. Why, you're doing it right now. \n[70]More to the point Jack, what did you do? \n[71]Happy Easter, Jack. \n[72]I thought this might happen. \n[73]They never really believed in you. I was just trying to show you that. But I understand. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 97. \n[74]No? I don't know what it's like to be cast out? \n[75]All those years in the shadows I thought, no one else knows what this feels like. But now I see I was wrong. \n[76]We don't have to be alone, Jack. \n[77]I believe in you. And I know children will too. \n[78]Yes! Look at what we can do! Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 98. \n[79]What goes together better than cold and dark? \n[80]We can make them believe. We'll give them a world where everything, everything is... \n[81]And Jack Frost too. They'll believe in both of us. \n[82]Very well. You want to be left alone? Done. But first... \n[83]The staff, Jack. \n[84]You have a bad habit of interfering. Now hand it over. And I'll let her go. \n[85]No. You said you wanted to be alone. So be alone! \n[86]You're all free to go! We won't be needing any Christmas toys this year, thank you! Nor ever again! \n[87]Only six left! Six precious children who still believe in the Guardians with all their h--  Make that, five. Oo! Four! Three! \n[88]One. \n[89]Jack Frost! Let's end this, shall we? \n[90]That little trick doesn't work on me anymore. \n[91]All this fuss over one little boy. And still he refuses to stop believing. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 115. \n[92]Very well. There are other ways to snuff out a light. \n[93]Look how fluffy you are! Would you like a scratch behind the ears? \n[94]I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this. You look awful. \n[95]So what do you think, Jamie? Do you believe in the Boogiema... \n[96]You think a few children can help you? Against this! \n[97]Aww, you'll protect them. But who will protect you? \n[98]Still think there's no such thing as the boogeyman? \n[99]No! Get them! \n[100]Do your jobs! \n[101]No. \n[102]You dare have fun in my presence! I am the Boogeyman! AND YOU WILL \n[103]Noooo! \n[104]No. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 129. \n[105]A quarter? \n[106]You can't get rid of me! Not forever! There will always be fear! \n[107]Really?
