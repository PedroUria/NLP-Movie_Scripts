{"dialogues": {"CADEN": "\n[1]Thanks. You didn't. I was just -- As Caden's voice goes under, we follow Adele into -- \n[2]I don't feel well. \n[3]Of course, honey. \n[4]It'll be fine, sweetie. I'll be back in a minute. \n[5]Harold Pinter died! \n[6]Do I press above or below it? \n[7]Will there be a scar? \n[8]I prefer there not be a scar. \n[9]What? The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart. He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck. \n[10]A little more yellow than usual. What? \n[11]A neurologist?      \n[12]Oh. The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then looks suspiciously in Caden's ears. \n[13]My pupils weren't properly dilating and, um, not doing the opposite ... \n[14]He doesn't know. Maybe. He said he doesn't think so. But maybe. But he doesn't know. But --      \n[15]No, honey.  It's the start of something awful. \n[16]What? No. Of course not.  This is really fucked timing. \n[17]He's the man who --      \n[18]Hey, Jim. I know. I'm sorry. I had an accident. No, I'm okay. \n[19]Different kind of pipe.  Just run lines. I'll be there soon. 'kay.  Houses have pipes. They're, like, tubes and they're behind walls and under the floor everywhere and -- Olive begins to whimper in horror. \n[20]It's okay. They just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets. It's like in your body you have veins and ... um... \n[21]And they're filled with blood. Olive is crying in earnest now. \n[22]I'm trying to explain plumbing. \n[23]No, honey, you're fine. \n[24]Well, I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood. \n[25]Thanks for getting me in right away. The doctor touches Caden's eye repeatedly with a small probe. \n[26]Is it the bump to the head?      \n[27]A neurologist? \n[28]I thought maybe you said urologist. Why do I need to see a neurologist? \n[29]That's not true, is it? \n[30]It just doesn't seem right. \n[31]I'm not sure. Accurate, I guess. \n[32]It's too late in the game to be having these problems, David.  You're sure you're okay? \n[33]Please.  That was good, Tom. \n[34]I saw that. I like it. Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a group of technicians are lifting the wall and trying to re- set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror. \n[35]Try to keep in mind that a young person playing Willy Loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. But the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation. \n[36]Great. Let's try it again.  How long, David? \n[37]Why don't you get cleaned up, Tom, and we'll go again. Tom exits. Caden rubs his temples, then heads to the back of the house, pulling out his cell phone. He exits the theater. \n[38]In more ways than one. \n[39]In search of elusive signal.      \n[40]That is odd. \n[41]Dr. Heshborg said I should see Dr. Scariano. My pupils don't work. \n[42]Maybe you should read the first line of another series of books. \n[43]Exactly twelve. Have you read Kafka?      \n[44]His whole name? \n[45]You should read The Trial, maybe. \n[46]I hope you like it. \n[47]I think I have blood in my stool. Adele looks over, half asleep. \n[48]It's a nightmare in there. \n[49]Well... not only. \n[50]Yeah? You like?      \n[51]You're not an idiot. Pause. \n[52]Then what do I say? \n[53]Why? \n[54]Can I piss in your sink? \n[55]It's gorgeous, Ad. \n[56]Awful. We have five hundred and sixty lighting cues. I don't know why I made it so complicated. \n[57]Yeah. Anyway, we got through it. I think you'll be impressed. \n[58]I have to get ready.     \n[59]Yeah. Absolutely.  Sorry. I have a bit of a headache. \n[60]I'll be around. I'll check in. She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek. \n[61]Ok, Claire. She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him. \n[62]Hey! \n[63]So you liked it? \n[64]Easy on the eyes. \n[65]She felt very strongly that it was right. They sip their drinks. \n[66]Had to work. Her Berlin show is in two weeks. We're going to spend like a month there. \n[67]Ah. \n[68]Choo! \n[69]Yeah, me too.      \n[70]I couldn't begin to guess. \n[71]Y'know. Sometimes. \n[72]I get kind of... something when I'm stoned. \n[73]Y'know... bothered. Horny. \n[74]Yeah, it really could. \n[75]You know I wish I could. \n[76]You're not staying for the reviews?      \n[77]I'm going to Berlin for a month for my wife's show. Then I don't know. \n[78]Yay or nay? \n[79]Hi. It's late. \n[80]We're a hit. Reviews are great. New York Times said it was brilliant to cast young actors as Willy and Linda. \n[81]Are you stoned?     \n[82]Yeah. Love to know what you think. \n[83]It's pustules. It's called sycosis. Spelled differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same. \n[84]Well, there's two different kinds of psychosis. They're spelled differently. P-s-y is like if you're crazy and s-y is like these things on my face. \n[85]I could. But I don't. \n[86]Ok. \n[87]La-ru-lee.      \n[88]Okay. \n[89]Okay. He stops. \n[90]I don't want you to die. \n[91]But I'll miss you.      \n[92]Where will it take you? \n[93]Why are you being like this? Adele has a coughing fit.      \n[94]No. I don't know. It's a stressful time. Our shows. The whole health thing. \n[95]I think I might have arthritis. Adele continues to talk on the phone. \n[96]My joints are stiff. Who was that?      \n[97]Right. It's been three hours since you spoke. \n[98]Can I ask you a question, Ad? She looks up at him. \n[99]Have I disappointed you somehow? She starts to cry, hugs him. \n[100]Be weird. \n[101]Oh, Haze. I wish I could. \n[102]I have an appointment. \n[103]What do you mean? \n[104]I won't. Sorry. \n[105]I'm afraid I'm going to die. They don't know what's wrong with me. I want to do something important. While I'm still here.      \n[106]Who wrote it? \n[107]I'm looking for... I'm sorry, I don't speak German. No. I'm -- \n[108]Hey! Thanks for meeting me. He points to his nose. She wipes at the soot on hers. \n[109]I didn't want to be alone. \n[110]I'm going through some things. \n[111]I can't really. But I'm meditating and running and taking vitamins.       \n[112]Cutting out sugar. I can't really say any more. It's ...      \n[113]You tell me something. Oh. I've cut out wheat. \n[114]What do we do with all this, Hazel? \n[115]Do I have to choose at all? \n[116]Adele is only on vacation.     \n[117]It's been a week. \n[118]Okay, just for one drink. Hazel smiles and stands. She scoops up the torn napkin pieces and puts them in her purse. \n[119]I really can't drink very much because of my condition. \n[120]Did you put something in it? \n[121]Sure, why not? \n[122]It's good. She takes a sip of her drink. Caden drinks some more of his. \n[123]Yeah. Kind of. \n[124]Um, I feel a lot of longing. \n[125]What? \n[126]Why am I doing this? \n[127]You'll help me forget my troubles? \n[128]I have a wife. \n[129]I'm just so confused. I'm sorry. I'm really sick. I think I'm dying. I have a kid. I'm married. \n[130]I had a good time. I think you're a very nice person. Really. \n[131]I'm so glad I finally got you. \n[132]It's Caden!  \n[133]Caden! I can't wait to see you and Olive on the 12th. um... I went someplace without you tonight, Ad. I went some place you couldn't come with me. I'm sorry. \n[134]Oh. Ok. Great. Have fu -- The connection is lost. Caden sits there, looks at the 2007 tax form in front of him, goes into convulsions. He manages to grab the phone, his hand flopping all over the dial. \n[135]I'm sick. \n[136]It's serious? \n[137]Okay. Thank you anyway. \n[138]A theater piece. Something big and true and tough. Y'know, finally put my real self into something. \n[139]Yeah, I mean, yeah. Oh, I wanted to ask you, how old are kids when they start to write? \n[140]Could a four year old keep a diary? \n[141]Aww. Cute. \n[142]Wow. Written by a four year old?      \n[143]That's horrible. \n[144]Is that possible? \n[145]Any of it. Why did he kill himself? \n[146]What? \n[147]Oh. I don't know. \n[148]I'm looking for a Christmas present for my daughter. Something pink. \n[149]Yes. That's good. \n[150]The idea is to do a massive theater piece. Uncompromising, honest. I don't know what it is yet or how to do it, but it'll come. It'll reveal itself. \n[151]Here\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s what I think theater is: it\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s the beginning of thought. The truth not yet spoken. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s a blackbird in winter. The moment before death. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s what a man feels after he\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s been clocked in the jaw. It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s love... in all its messiness. And I want all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of it, the mikvah, as the Jews call it. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2re all in the same water, after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions. This is what I want to try to give people, Hazel. And I want your help. Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his plate and concentrates.      \n[152]Salivating.  I have to concentrate.  Biofeedback training. \n[153]So I was wondering if you'll help. \n[154]No. Like as my assistant. \n[155]I just want to normalize it, Hazel. I think we'd have fun together. He swallows some food then concentrates. She watches him. \n[156]I miss you. He concentrates some more. She stares at him. \n[157]I'm digesting. \n[158]We'll start by talking honestly. Out of that a piece of theater will evolve. I'll begin.       \n[159]I've been thinking a lot about dying lately. \n[160]I appreciate that, Claire, but -- \n[161]We are all hurtling toward death.  Yet here we are, for the moment, alive. Each of us knowing we will die; each of us secretly believing we won't. Nobody says anything for a long moment. \n[162]Hi. I haven't heard from you so I thought I'd say hi. Hi, Hazel! He giggles crazily, coughs, then hangs up, embarrassed, grimaces once more, then dials again. \n[163]Yeah? Um, I was calling to say hi, chat about today maybe. \n[164]Yeah. Do you maybe want to get a drink or something? It's late so -- \n[165]Oh, hey. \n[166]Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire. \n[167]How's everything, Haze... ul? \n[168]Yeah, I guess. Caden steals glances at Hazel, chatting animatedly, throughout his conversation with Claire. He hears occasional snippets. \n[169]Really? Why? \n[170]I don't know what I'm doing. \n[171]I don't know. \n[172]Hmm? \n[173]Oh. Well, we'll build it over time together. Find a real person, maybe, to model it after. \n[174]Um, yeah. Something to think about. Sure. Although -- \n[175]No. I have these health issues. \n[176]I'm sorry.  When I get tired I have to remember to breathe. It's a new thing. My autonomic functions are failing. \n[177]My God. I'm so sorry. What are you doing out? \n[178]Oh. I see. Well, um, What happened to your mother, if I could ask? I mean, God, that's an awful thing to ask. I'm sorry. I don't mean to -- It's just that, I'm -- \n[179]In half? \n[180]I don't know how it's Freudian. \n[181]Oh. Well, I'm sorry about your mother. In half? \n[182]What is it? What? She weeps silently, with gaping mouth. Caden awkwardly embraces her. She remains stiff. \n[183]Do you want me to drive you home? She shakes her head \"no\" over and over. Then she looks in at her reflection in the car window. \n[184]It's okay. Everyone does that. It's -- is there anything I can do? \n[185]I'm so sorry. \n[186]I'm so in love with you. Claire smiles, strokes his hair. \n[187]I have problems, Claire. I'm still attached to my wife. I have also -- I have also -- feelings for Hazel. \n[188]I've left them behind. I've gone somewhere without them. I'm guilty of so much. \n[189]There will be no other before you.     \n[190]Okay, hold it. We're not really -- I think we need to work on your characters individually. We need to investigate, to really discover the essence of each being. Davis, I'll start with you. Caden walks off with Davis. Claire seethes. \n[191]I think you should pick another subject. Other than Hazel. \n[192]No. It's just. I don't feel like there's enough there. Claire thinks for a moment. \n[193]Tell me. \n[194]My real daughter. \n[195]She's tattooed! \n[196]I'll be quick. I'll do it quick. \n[197]I'm not sure I'm getting the book. \n[198]I'm looking for Adele Cotard. \n[199]I'm her husband. \n[200]You're here, too? \n[201]Maria, I can't believe Adele got her tattooed like that. I mean -- \n[202]She's a four year old! \n[203]What'd you do to my family? What'd you do to my daughter? \n[204]Yeah, I want to bring my production to New York. To get it seen. By people, you know, who matter. The sooner the better. \n[205]Ok, you're a doctor, right? Am I dying? Can you tell me that?      \n[206]No, you can't tell me?  \n[207]What are you doing here? You look great. \n[208]What are you doing in New York? \n[209]The boys? \n[210]How old?      \n[211]Ah. Yes.  Nice names. Where are they? \n[212]Ah. \n[213]Y\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2know. I was with Claire. We have a daughter, but we're separated now. How about with you? \n[214]Great. You wear a lab coat? \n[215]Okay. Good seeing you, Hazel. Hazel smiles and waves and turns to head into the store. Caden watches after her.     \n[216]It's me. \n[217]I want to come back. I want to take care of you and Olive. Ariel. There's silence then the door opens. Claire is crying. \n[218]Hello? What's wrong? Okay. Okay. Caden hangs up. Claire kisses Caden's neck. \n[219]My father died. \n[220]His body was riddled with cancer. He didn't even know. He went in because his finger hurt. \n[221]They said he suffered horribly. That he called out for me right before he died. They said he said he regretted his life. They said he said a lot of things. Too many to recount. They said it was the longest and saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever heard. \n[222]Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom. \n[223]Hey. \n[224]I had to talk to you. My father died. \n[225]Yeah. With Claire and Ariel. \n[226]I don't know. You got quiet. I thought I should say something.      \n[227]What am I supposed to do, Hazel? I have a kid with her. You have twins with Derek. Three twins. It's confusing! \n[228]Yes. Of course. I mean, what -- \n[229]Hazel, please, I can't bear it if you go. \n[230]I need to use a cane now.  Okay. Take care. Hazel hangs up. Caden sits there. \n[231]I'd just like a little sympathy.      \n[232]Millennia dead? What? And since when do you care about anything? \n[233]Hazel! Hazel and Derek turn. \n[234]Tell me what to do. \n[235]I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I screwed everything up. I don't have any courage. I'm sorry.      \n[236]I don't want you to be okay. I mean, I do but it rips my guts out. \n[237]I'll help you through, too. \n[238]I won't settle for anything less than the brutal truth. Brutal! Each day I'll hand you a scrap of paper. It'll tell you what happened to you that day. \"You felt a lump in your breast. You looked at your wife and saw a stranger.\" Etcetera. \n[239]Oh God. \n[240]Good. Tell me why you're here. \n[241]Yes, okay. You've got the part. Sammy nods and exits. Hazel follows him with her eyes. \n[242]Please don't fall in love with him. \n[243]It's new. Sammy jots a note. Caden places his backpack on a sink. He looks at himself in the mirror, stalling. \n[244]When it's ready. \n[245]I was thinking of calling it Simulacrum. What do you think? \n[246]How about The Flawed Light of Love and Grief? \n[247]Claire? I want you to drop your \n[248]She left us. You know that better than anyone. Except me. \n[249]How do you know that? \n[250]Anyway, I don't know where she is. A strange dirigible flies very low overhead. \n[251]Why are you giving this to me? \n[252]Have a good night. He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees the old person knocking feebly on a door down the hall.      \n[253]What? \n[254]Yes, I'm Ellen. Old Person #2 fishes a key out of the overcoat pocket. \n[255]Ok. Thank you. Old Person #2 turns and heads back down the hall to Old Person #1, whose nose has started to bleed. \n[256]I went for a walk. I had to think. \n[257]No! What do I smell like? Like bad? Like an old person? \n[258]That's great, you guys. Sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of paper. Hazel hovers behind him, watching. \n[259]Beautiful, Sammy. Caden leaves the set and steps onto his platform. \n[260]I guess, yeah. Claire walks off in a huff. \n[261]I didn't say I was going to clean Hazel's toilet. He did. \n[262]I thought it. But I didn't say it. Claire packs up her stuff. \n[263]Jesus. Claire! Please! \n[264]Yeah. \n[265]This is the end of my stuff. \n[266]This is a lie! Caden paces. The actors stop what they're doing, sit with their legs dangling off the edge of their apartments, wait for instructions. Caden limps off to the set designer's office. \n[267]Wall it up. \n[268]Sorry. \n[269]Oh, shit. I need to do that, too. Haze, keep an eye on things? \n[270]Will, I need you to build this. Caden hands Will shots of the exterior and interiors of Adele's building and of apartment 31Y.     \n[271]Hazel, what do you think of this title: Unknown, Unkissed, and Lost? \n[272]Hi, Millicent. Have a seat. How are you at cleaning? \n[273]Because this part requires a lot of it. You'd play a cleaning lady. \n[274]You're weirdly close to what I've visualized for this character. \n[275]Good work, everyone. Nobody acknowledges him.     \n[276]Where're Sammy and Hazel? Tammy jerks her head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has Hazel with her back against a wall. They are talking intimately. Caden approaches. \n[277]Hey, Sammy, what are you doing? Sammy and Hazel look over casually. \n[278]This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you want to like a Hazel, like that one. Caden points indicates Tammy. Sammy squints over. \n[279]You don't like him, do you? \n[280]I'm me. You don't need someone to remind you of me.      \n[281]I'm fun. \n[282]Was my father standing with us? \n[283]He's dead. He looks dead, I guess. \n[284]A little moustache? She shrugs. \n[285]I asked Hazel but she was busy tonight and you're the next best thing. I mean, it isn't that you're the next best thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. Does that make sense? Although the thing is offstage you're nothing like her. You play her very well though. Did Hazel mention what she was doing tonight because I called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn't going to be back till late and I thought that was weird because she told me Philip was sick. \n[286]That's interesting. \n[287]Thank you, Yammy. Caden takes the phone and limps off. \n[288]Hey. What you up to? \n[289]Why didn't you tell me that before? \n[290]It mostly makes me sad that it doesn't make you sad. \n[291]I want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away! \n[292]He has stories about me! \n[293]Did you always want to be an actress? \n[294]Is that true? \n[295]I thought someone would've cleaned it up. \n[296]I don't know! Someone. \n[297]This is my room. You can sleep here. \n[298]The living room couch. \n[299]Okay. If you think it's okay. Tammy laughs, matter-of-factly gets undressed in front of Caden. He just stands there uncomfortably. \n[300]How can you be like that? \n[301]In front of someone is different. \n[302]Maybe because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that makes it easier. \n[303]I do. Yes. Um. Do you? \n[304]I'm sorry. I'm very lonely. I don't know what's wrong. I just -- I'm sorry. Can you understand? Do you understand loneliness? \n[305]I'm sorry. \n[306]You're very pretty.      \n[307]Sometimes I wish I were pretty like that. \n[308]Sometimes I think I might've been better at it. \n[309]No. No. I like women. I only like women. \n[310]Thanks. Thank you for saying that. \n[311]That's Hazel's house. Caden points to the house with smoke seeping out the windows. \n[312]Um... \n[313]Yeah. I don't know. I have to speak to the fire marshal. \n[314]I think both of you Hazels are going to like this. Turn off here. Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp. \n[315]Hank! Okay! The house begins to smoke. \n[316]It's verisimilitudinous. I'm thinking of that as a title. \n[317]She's not my girlfriend. \n[318]Tammy! We have to get back.     \n[319]Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, \"Jeremy big.\" Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall. \n[320]Sure. \n[321]Let's try it. Maybe it could happen at the director's table. \n[322]Tammy was right. I don't understand why you're with Sammy. \n[323]That happened one time! You fucked him? \n[324]What do you mean, he's available? Since when are you available? \n[325]When? How come you never told me? \n[326]Fuck. I have to let the actor who plays Derek go. What is his name?      \n[327]It's not my response. It just crossed my mind. We have enormous budgetary concerns here. \n[328]She looks like you. And -- \n[329]I don't know. Yeah. It was nice. \n[330]No! \n[331]Okay, I cried a little before.  Hazel, you've been part of me forever. Don't you know that? I breathe your name in every exhalation.      \n[332]I don't know. Hazel latches her pinky around Caden's. Sammy has been watching the whole thing from behind a pillar. Caden glances at his watch. \n[333]Crap, Ellen's October 23rd scene! \n[334]What's going on, Maurice? \n[335]Okay. Are we good to go? \n[336]Did you hear that? \n[337]This is the wrong key, Sandy. \n[338]Adele! Adele, are you in there? \n[339]Adele? \n[340]Yeah, okay. Can we just get the right key, so we can do the scene? Please, somebody? \n[341]Look familiar? \n[342]Listen, I built this because I wanted to show you what happened -- \n[343]No fair, Sammy! She wouldn't see you jump. She never saw me! You're not being authentic. \n[344]I know how to do it now. There are nearly thirteen million people in the world. Try to imagine that many people! None of those people is an extra. They're all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due. \n[345]Do you see what I'm saying? Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden, imploringly. \n[346]We could get a place together. We could get a loft. \n[347]Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other one. The retarded one. \n[348]You can't cause someone to kill himself. He was troubled. \n[349]My heart aches so much for you. \n[350]I'm aching for it being over. \n[351]God. You're just perfect. \n[352]It doesn't always happen for me now. Because of the medication and everything. I take a lot of pills. \n[353]I'm embarrassed. I just want you to know it's not you. And it's not me. It's the medication. They are tender and quiet and intensely focused. The smoke in the room is dense. When it's over, they lie there quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden cries quietly. \n[354]I'm sorry. \n[355]I have a title. The Obscure Moon Lighting an Obscure World. \n[356]It's Maria. She did this. \n[357]Your mother and Maria took you away. I tried for years to find you. I didn't leave you. \n[358]What? I'm not a homosexual! \n[359]She's lying to you. \n[360]Maria is your lover? \n[361]You have no idea how evil she is. \n[362]\n[363]Can you ever forgive me? \n[364]For abandoning you. \n[365]For abandoning you to be have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric. \n[366]My love. I know how to do the play. It'll take place over the course of one day. The day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. I'll be able to relive it forever. \n[367]I need a Caden for my Hazel. \n[368]Um...      \n[369]I don't understand him. \n[370]Okay. That sounds good. \n[371]I have a new title, maybe. Infectious Diseases In Cattle. \n[372]The title is about a lot of things. You'll see. It's about a lot.  Are you gay, Michael? \n[373]Do you know someone named Eric?      \n[374]Ok, take off the sweater. Tammy takes off the sweater, puts it on the chair back. \n[375]Smile shyly at each other. They do. It lingers. Millicent looks over at the funeral scene. It's dull and static. \n[376]Millicent. She turns. He waves her over. Tammy sits on the stoop. \n[377]That was ... spectacular. \n[378]I need to keep my hand in. \n[379]Filled? You mean...? \n[380]I do like to clean. \n[381]Yes? \n[382]Thank you. \n[383]Have a very good day. \n[384]Eric. Caden looks over. No note from Adele. He gets out of bed, glances in the mirror, seems surprised by his reflection. \n[385]Hello. The woman turns. She's middle-aged, face radiating kindness. \n[386]Where is everybody? \n[387]Would you sit with me for a moment? I'm very tired. And lonely. The woman smiles at Caden. They sit on a log. \n[388]I feel like I know you. \n[389]Yes! That's it. Yes. You seem a bit older than I remember. \n[390]I didn't mean to say you look old.      \n[391]Everyone's dreams in all those apartments. All those secrets we'll never know. That's the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know. \n[392]I'm sorry the experiment didn't work. I wanted it to with all my heart. I wanted to do that picnic with my daughter. I feel I've disappointed you terribly. \n[393]All I want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness. For me to be the most special person in the world to just one person. \n[394]I know what to do with this play now. I have an idea. I think -- The screen goes black fast. ", "HAZEL": "\n[1]I just heard the death of the salesman. \n[2]Oh no.  \n[3]Signal's good here, oddly. She pats her lap in a friendly manner. \n[4]I know! Cell phones, they're crazy! \n[5]I keep reading the first line. It's a good line, I think. But I don't know much about literature. \n[6]I'm trying to better myself, Caden. Recommend me something. You're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books. \n[7]Um, I've read his name. A lot! I swear!      \n[8]Okay, not his entire name. Heinz? \n[9]If you say so, I will. Can't wait till Wednesday. I'm so excited to see it. \n[10]It's pretty impossible that I won't, you know. I mean... She trails off, shrugs. They smile at each other. Caden exits. Hazel looks at her book, re-reads the first sentence. \n[11]The car crash? \n[12]Sorry. So I'm reading The Trial. \n[13]Love. I'm such an idiot for not knowing about this book.  It's famous, it turns out. \n[14]Then you say, in fact, you're very bright, Hazel. And I love your eyes. \n[15]I can't say what then you say. \n[16]Cause it's dirty. A whistling noise turns their heads. In the distance a man with an unopened parachute is plummeting. \n[17]Oh my God! Jesus! They watch as the man falls behind a building. A scream. A screech of brakes. \n[18]He's gotta be dead. Right? \n[19]I figured I'd better get in fast. \n[20]I loved it! And, by the way, Claire is trouble. And not terribly bright. Caden laughs. \n[21]Just wanted you to know the word on the street.      \n[22]Are you kidding? I cried for like fifteen minutes after. I loved every minute of it. Except Claire. I thought she was weak. \n[23]Oh, Caden, not you, too. What I want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the line, 'I can't cry for you Willy...'? \n[24]Where's el wife-o? \n[25]Ah. \n[26]Ah. \n[27]Hooray! We've still got it!  I'll miss you. \n[28]Why do I like you so much?  \n[29]Me neither. It must be that you're married. Do you get high, my friend? \n[30]You want to now? With me. In my car. \n[31]What does something mean? \n[32]And me with a station wagon and all. Could be dangerous. \n[33]You're absolutely zero fun. \n[34]Jesus, I like you. I'm going. \n[35]I know it's brilliant. I don't need some dope with elbow patches telling me. She smiles, gives him a hug, and heads toward the door. \n[36]You're not going to make it, baby. \n[37]I've always loved this house. \n[38]It's a scary decision. I never thought I'd buy a house alone. But, y'know, I'm 36, and I wonder what I'm really waiting for. \n[39]I like it, I do. But I'm really concerned about dying in the fire. \n[40]We should get a drink. Be fun. \n[41]I like weird. I like you. See? He doesn't say anything. \n[42]Anyway. I don't want to make you uncomfortable. I just thought it would be a fun diversion. Okay, I do want to make you uncomfortable. \n[43]You can, Cade. You can!      \n[44]Crease. \n[45]It's just a word. Don't get all bent out of shape. Jeez. \n[46]God, I'm delighted. Thought you'd never ask. You did ask, right? \n[47]Who does?  You don't look like you feel well. \n[48]You want to tell me about it? \n[49]Ok. Tell me something else. \n[50]Um, I bought this really nifty sweater today. On sale. Fifty dollars reduced from three hundred! \n[51]I don't know. We fuck? We continue to sort of flirt? You divorce your wife and marry me and I make you happy for the very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear?  We call it a day?  Don't choose the last one. I just said that one for effect. \n[52]No, I suppose not. Choosing is not your strong suit. You want to come over to my place, Cotard? \n[53]She hasn't called you since she left. You've left countless messages. It's been a year.      \n[54]I'm going to buy you a calendar. Caden rips a cocktail napkin into little pieces. \n[55]Scraps for my scrapbook. Caden watches her ass as she turns to leave. \n[56]Caden's mysterious condition. Well, have one sip, anyway. \n[57]Would you like me to have? A little love potion, perhaps? \n[58]If that's what it takes, consider it done. Poof! Love potion number 69.      \n[59]Does it make you want to kiss me? \n[60]Tell me why? \n[61]Hmm. Beg a girl, why dontcha. \n[62]I'd like you to beg me on your knees for a kiss. Just for fun. Dumbly, Caden gets down on his knees. \n[63]For fun, baby. \n[64]Oh, kiddo, you don't even know. \n[65]You have me. And I adore you.     \n[66]What? What is it? \n[67]Yeah. I just thought this might change things. I hoped. Ugh. \n[68]That is just the wrong thing to say right now, Caden. You should go. \n[69]Caden, I won't be yet another woman you feel guilty about.      \n[70]Here. Take this. I got like five for Christmas. Goddamn Christmas. She hands him a 2009 calendar. It features photos of Adele. \n[71]Huh. Pause. \n[72]What are you doing? \n[73]Huh. \n[74]In your box office? \n[75]I'm not sure I can work with you, Caden. I'm kind of angry. \n[76]It's really disturbing. \n[77]You are so obnoxious! \n[78]Yeah, well, you find it awfully charming. My obnoxiousity. \n[79]You don't want to cross me. \n[80]No. Because you like me so much. \n[81]And my use of the word \"obnoxiousity.\" \n[82]Yes. You're delicious in your acquiescence. Claire enters, looks for Caden. She spots Hazel first. \n[83]Hi, Claire. \n[84]Hazel. \n[85]Yes, I'm the box office. \n[86]Wonderful! You? \n[87]Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard. Hazel looks around now, too. Both spot Caden at the same time. He smiles and waves and approaches. \n[88]This is Derek. \n[89]Hi, Derek. \n[90]Great, Cade. En. \n[91]Yes. \n[92]Yeah, okay. Thanks. Derek and I -- \n[93]Whitrow says, \"If a mind is regarded to be a memory-based process of integration...\" \n[94]Caden! I was wondering if I was going to bump into you! She gives him a hug, notices his shaking leg. \n[95]Um, yeah. For a while now. \n[96]Oh. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m here with Derek and the boys. Mini-vacation! You know. \n[97]Yeah. I thought you knew. \n[98]Five. Twins. Robert and Daniel and Allan. \n[99]Oh. Derek took them to Natural History. So I could shop. \n[100]Nice to see you, Caden. How are things? \n[101]Good. The kids are wonderful. I have a great job at Lens Shapers. \n[102]It\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s so good to see you. I should run. I want to get some shopping in. We\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2re meeting back at the hotel at three. Then sushi! \n[103]Caden? \n[104]Oh no. Oh, Caden. I'm so sorry. \n[105]Yes, I got that. \n[106]You thought you should say something. That's lovely. That's what makes our relationship so special. The obligation. \n[107]Yeah, I guess that's what happens when you have a kid with somebody else. You having sex with her? \n[108]I have to go. I'm sorry about your dad. That's awful news. \n[109]I have to. I'm going out. I have to get ready. Everything's fine. \n[110]Oh, honey, I can't anymore. \n[111]It's okay. I'm okay. \n[112]I'll always be your friend. I'll help you through any way I can. \n[113]Caden, I'm fine. I have Derek. \n[114]They fired me. I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis. I didn't wash my hands. I had pink eye hands! Pink hands! \n[115]I didn't wash my hands! I'm a stupid cow! I don't have anything to show for being on this planet. And this fucking private Christian school is killing us. It's not cheap. It's Derek's thing. I don't believe in that shit. Y'know? Try to be a good person. That's all there is. I'm sorry. I'm talking too much. Do you have anything for me, Caden?      \n[116]Sammy Barnathan? Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands. \n[117]He's good, Caden. \n[118]I only have eyes for you, dear. \n[119]I get to be a character? Hooray! \n[120]Already put out a call for a Claire replacement. Would you really clean my bathroom? \n[121]God, Caden, it's all so fucked. \n[122]Yup. June 9th? Caden nods, rushes out the door of the warehouse set. \n[123]Eh. Caden this is Millicent Weems. \n[124]Kind of. He reminds me of you. \n[125]Don't worry, Caden. I like you more. I do. Sammy's just fun. \n[126]Oh, sweetie. No, you're not. Caden's cell phone rings. He answers it. \n[127]Caden. I don't want to say things that are going to make you sad. \n[128]You want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner? I don't know how to do that. \n[129]It just happened, Caden. I didn't plan it. You were with Claire. This probably isn't going to go anywhere, sweetie. I'm still your girl. \n[130]Caden, I know everything about you and it's all adorable. I love you and I always will. So don't worry. I gotta go, I'm there. Hazel hangs up. Caden stands there for a minute.     \n[131]Is there no end to your pussy kissing? \n[132]Whatever. I've got work to do. Tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back. \n[133]Give it a rest, Caden. I can smell her on your breath. \n[134]That didn't happen, Caden. \n[135]But Hazel hasn't done it, Tammy.      \n[136]He's nice. He's available. He fucks me without crying. \n[137]Yes! And you and I only fucked one time that's why you only cried one time! I give you endless opportunities. \n[138]Derek left. Because of you! \n[139]I don't know, Caden. How come a lot of things? It's not like we can start fresh, like Sammy and I can. There's all this pressure on us. We're finally both free and there's all this fucking pressure.      \n[140]That's such a romantic response. I'm touched. \n[141]Ugh. Forget it.  Derek is played by Joe -- \n[142]Yes. Was it good? \n[143]Did you cry? \n[144]You're making progress. \n[145]Oh, Caden. Oh, fuck. What the fuck are we doing? \n[146]\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c5\u0093What?\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d \n[147]I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m sure I would\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2ve remembered that. No. The shower turns on. Caden grabs the key from Millicent. \n[148]Caden, there's no one in there. You've got to let go of her. She's not here anymore. I'm here.      \n[149]Yeah, we'll get the right key. \n[150]Oh my God! It's an exact replica of the Tethered Maiden Terrace! Derek and the kids and I had so much fun on that trip! \n[151]Come over tonight? Please? \n[152]God, Caden, that sounds nice. I miss my daughter. Maybe she could come live with us. \n[153]I'm a bad person.      \n[154]I'm so ashamed of myself. Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder. \n[155]Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when we were young. And all the years in between. So many years, so fast.  What did we do? Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips. \n[156]We're here, Caden. I'm here. \n[157]Yeah. The end is built in to the beginning. What can you do? \n[158]I'm a mess. But we fit, don't we. They kiss, then Hazel climbs into bed. \n[159]I don't care. It's okay.      \n[160]It's okay. It's different crying this time. I can tell. I'm crying, too. And I cried last time. After you left. I never told you. But I cried, too. Caden kisses her again. \n[161]I think it might be too much. ", "CLAIRE": "\n[1]Willy, you coming up!!!! \n[2]Willy? Tom climbs in the car. CLAIRE  (CONT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2D) Willy? Answer me!...Willy! Tom starts the car and guns the engine. A brick wall off stage speeds into the car, accompanied by crashing and screeching sound effects. CLAIRE  (CONT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2D) No!!! \n[3]Willy! \n[4]Why? What happened?  Did something happen, Willy? \n[5]You didn't smash the car, did you? \n[6]Don't you feel well? \n[7]Where were you all day? You look terrible. \n[8]What? \n[9]Ugh, I hated myself tonight. Plus I'm so bloated and enormous.      \n[10]I just want to thank you for everything. You've been absolutely brilliant and it's going to be miserable going ahead without you. \n[11]God, I'm such a baby. She just looks at him and smiles and nods. \n[12]I'm going to get drunk, that's what. \n[13]What are you going to do now? \n[14]I wish I was your wife or a wife or had a wife. Or was German even. I'm so lonely with none of those things. A man walks in with a bunch of newspapers.      \n[15]I'll be with you in a minute. Go on, Charley. I want to, just a minute. The other characters exit the stage. CLAIRE  (CONT\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2D)  I never had a chance to say good- bye. Forgive me, dear. I can't cry.  I don't understand it; I can't cry. It seems to me that you're just on another trip. I keep expecting you. Willy, dear, why did you do it? I search and search and I search, and I can 't understand it, Willy. I made the last payment on the house today. Today, dear. And there'll be nobody home.

It's brilliant. It's everything. It's Karamazov. \n[18]Hello? \n[19]Hi! Here you are, on my phone! \n[20]Yeah! Yeah yeah yeah! \n[21]Hi...! \n[22]Of course. Hazel. I knew that! Duh! The box office. \n[23]How are you? \n[24]Fine, thanks. I was supposed to meet Caden here. You know Mr. Cotard, right?      \n[25]That was awkward. \n[26]Let's talk about our project. I'm so excited about it. \n[27]I just think it's... brave. I feel like I'm going to be part of a revolution. I keep thinking Artaud. I keep thinking Krapp's Last Tape. Grotowski, for Christ's sake! \n[28]... theater can we take as a country? Y'know? Knowing that you don't know is the first and most essential step to knowing. Y'know? \n[29]So tell me what you want from me? \n[30]From my character.      \n[31]That Hazel girl is kind of interesting, maybe. As a model. \n[32]Poor darling. It's fine.      \n[33]My mother died last night. \n[34]Ugh, I couldn't deal with my sisters. It's like living in a Heironymous Bosch painting. \n[35]Oh, this is me. No, it's okay. She fell. Slipped in her bathroom. Hit her head. It actually split in half. Horrible. They stop at a small hatchback with a cow painted on it. \n[36]Yes. Well, it was nice meeting you. Did I say \"meeting\"? Ugh, I'm such an idiot.      \n[37]Y'know. Like \"meet\"? To meet? \n[38]It's okay. It's life. It's -- Claire's face contorts into a horrifying, paralyzed grimace. \n[39]Sometimes when I cry, I watch myself so I can remember how it looks for future roles. It's horrible. I hate myself. \n[40]I used to be a baby.  \n[41]I was a baby girl with hair of spun gold, the prettiest baby anyone had ever seen. One day the townsfolk, who were jealous of my beauty, decided to steal me away. \n[42]It was a bearded old man. Caden can hold out no longer. He kisses her. They fall back on the bed. He kisses her all over as she continues to tell the story. Her voice becomes irresistibly melodious. \n[43]He said to me, \"young lady, I have in my satchel a ring. Whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the woodland sprites.\" \n[44]He said, \"There is one more thing. You must never tell anyone what you promised me. If you do, you will die.\"     \n[45]So I used my new power to kill all the townsfolk. Horrible, humiliating deaths. I was reunited with my family. And I lived happily ever after, doing only good with my new powers. Caden cries and rests his head on her thigh. \n[46]Why are you crying, honey? \n[47]Really? Hazel? Oh. Really? Our Hazel? That's really interesting. I must've picked that up unconsciously. Wow. Boy. Gosh. \n[48]It's okay. We'll be fine. You're with me now. We'll be good. \n[49]Davis, I'll start with you. There's a difference between favoring me and pretending we've never met. I mean, we had Ariel, I think people know we've fucked.      \n[50]She's 36. Works in a theater box office. She had acting aspirations but lacked the confidence to pursue them. Her life is passing by. She is alone. She's old and ugly -- \n[51]Sacred ground? \n[52]I suppose not. She is limited. Okay. There's this single mother who lives downstairs. I find her really deep and sad. \n[53]I'm 42. I have a small child and no husband. I work long hours as a cashier at a mini-mart. Sometimes I worry my child will not even recognize me when I come home -- Claire cries like she did when her mother died. Ariel cries.      \n[54]Check on her. Please, sweetie. I'm arriving at something. \n[55]Your daughter is right here. \n[56]Please don't do this to us. \n[57]Everyone's tattooed! \n[58]Everyone's tattooed. Please. \n[59]Daddy doesn't live with us anymore, baby. He had to find himself. Claire shoots daggers at Caden and goes back to ironing. Nearby, Tom and Davis rehearse their scene in another \"apartment.\" \n[60]Yes? \n[61]I just want you to love us. Caden hugs her. Ariel hugs Caden's good leg.      \n[62]It's 3:30. For crying out fuck. Caden answers the phone. \n[63]Oh, baby. \n[64]It's okay, baby. It's going to be okay. Let me make you feel better. Claire begins kissing her way down Caden's chest. \n[65]The cry of the North American Caden. \n[66]I'll save my sympathy for the eighty million people with avian flu, the Tsunami victims in Puerto Rico, the countless millennia dead from... how fucked it all is. \n[67]I care every day about things! I care about us! ... Y'know?! \n[68]I don't know what it means. \n[69]I'm not sure. Sammy jots something in his book. \n[70]I'm going to work in my journal. You guys need anything? \n[71]Yeah? That was a fun play. Emotionally tough, but fucking fulfilling.       \n[72]And I loved working with so many strong female actresses. Ugh, Lorca's a genius. Okay. I'm going to start thinking about myself. Claire exits. \n[73]All night? You smell weird. Are you wearing lipstick? \n[74]I don't know. Like mold? I don't know. Like mold and ... cleaning products? Like you're menstruating? I don't know! \n[75]I don't like that guy you got to play you. \n[76]I think you need to fire him. Caden hands her a scrap of paper. \n[77]Oh, fuck you. I'm forty-five years old. I don't want to do this shit anymore. \n[78]He's coming on to me. He's feeling my ass during rehearsal. \n[79]He's not my Godamn husband! You are! What is wrong with you? The actor underneath them pounds on his ceiling.      \n[80]Ugh! I'm going to rehearsal. She grabs her coat, tosses the note into the trash, and storms out and down the stairs. \n[81]Caden, what are you doing at night? I have a right to fucking know. \n[82]Do you know what I've given up for you? For this. For you. For you.      \n[83]Get the door. Please. Just... Sammy opens it. Tammy, playing Hazel, stands there. \n[84]Maybe you can clean her toilet. \n[85]It's over, Caden. \n[86]I'm not talking to you. Claire turns to Caden.      \n[87]But you thought it. There's a silence. Hazel watches Caden closely. \n[88]I got an offer to do Needleman in a Haystack and I'm going to take it. I want you out of the apartment. The real one. You can keep this one. Claire heads down the stairs. \n[89]Oh, Needleman, you had such potential. But I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m afraid I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m going to have to move on. \n[90]I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m not a chance-giving girl. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2m a fun-loving girl. Remember? \n[91]My analyst says you have complexes. \n[92]That\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s before my analyst taught me that my enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non- enjoymnent of them. \n[93]She told me your hatred of her is a sign of your latent homosexuality. ", "ADELE": "\n[1]Ugh. Caden! (looks at bright green smear on toilet paper That's weird. The phone stops ringing. \n[2]Honey, I have to get this. You're going to be fine. \n[3]Hey.  Oh, wiping Olive's ass. You? Caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee. He sips it and stares out the window. It's raining. \n[4]You're kidding! Holy fuck! Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call. \n[5]All right, baby. See you then. Adele clicks off her cellphone. \n[6]I have your oatmeal, honey. \n[7]Here. Now you better eat this. \n[8]Jesus! Caden! What the fuck -- ?! Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her curled toes clenched. She holds a large stuffed owl. \n[9]Honey, don't look. Olive turns around. \n[10]Put pressure. Press. Press! \n[11]I don't know! Just... both! Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves. \n[12]I can't turn it! It's gonna flood! Olive hugs the owl tightly and it speaks. \n[13]No, it's Friday, honey. \n[14]So what exactly did he say? \n[15]Constricting. \n[16]Caden. \n[17]Not for a long time, honey. Caden pulls out a cell phone and dials. \n[18]What's wrong, baby? \n[19]Capillaries. \n[20]What are you doing? Jesus. \n[21]Well, stop it.  It's okay, honey. \n[22]You don't have to worry, baby. You don't have blood. \n[23]Caden, stop it! Olive cries. Adele coughs. Caden stares out the window. It's dark, but his pupils are pinpricks. \n[24]That stool in your office? \n[25]When I was pregnant with Olive... \n[26]Um... I don't know. Hopeful or something. Like something was going to change. \n[27]Maybe not as much as I had hoped. That's a terrible thing to say. \n[28]I feel alone sometimes. I feel exhausted. Can I say something awful? \n[29]I've fantasized about Caden dying and being able to start again. Guilt free. I know it's terrible. \n[30]Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a field of flames. \n[31]Thanks. How was rehearsal? \n[32]It's what you do. \n[33]Caden, listen, I'm really sorry. I just can't go tonight.  I'm sorry. I've got to get two canvases ready to ship. By tomorrow. I know it sucks. \n[34]Maria came over to keep me company and we lost track. I'm sorry I missed the play. But I got everything done here. How'd it go? \n[35]I'll see it tomorrow. Tonight! Adele and Maria laugh. \n[36]A little. I don't know. Y'know? I mean, are you happy with it?      \n[37]It doesn't matter what I think. \n[38]Do you really believe that tripe? \n[39]Ok, fine. But it's not you. It's not anyone. It's not real. \n[40]Is that your entire frame of reference for relationship problems? \n[41]Oh, you're fine. \n[42]No, I know. Exactly. Caden picks up the newspaper. It's dated May 25th, 2006. He flips through, finds the obituaries and starts to read. \n[43]Ok. All right. Yeah. Ok, bye. Adele hangs up the phone, looks at the paper. \n[44]Maria. \n[45]Caden, I think I want to go to Berlin with just Olive. Caden looks up. \n[46]I think it would be good for us. Silence. Caden's father appears in the doorway. \n[47]Caden. I don't know. Y'know? I don't know what I'm doing. It's just a little time apart.  We'll talk when I get back. Everyone is disappointing. The more you know someone. The whole romantic love thing is just projection. Right? I don't know.  I'm sorry. I love you. I don't know what I'm doing. We'll talk when I get back.     \n[48]Hello? Hello? Who is this? \n[49]Ellen? \n[50]What? Who is this? Oh, I have to go. There's a party. I'm famous! ", "OLIVE": "\n[1]Is something wrong with my poop?      \n[2]I didn't! What's wrong with me?! A cellphone rings in the other room. \n[3]But, Mommy -- Adele runs into -- \n[4]Daddy, my poop is green. Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out. \n[5]Am I going to be okay?      \n[6]Did you have green poop when you were little? \n[7]Is poop alive? \n[8]Mom!      \n[9]I want peanut butter and jelly. \n[10]Can I watch TV till school? Caden clicks the remote for Olive and goes back to his paper. A cartoon cow talks to a cartoon sheep.      \n[11]Mommy, Daddy has blood. \n[12]It's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. And the world is too big to understand and today is Tuesday and --  Mom, is today Tuesday? \n[13]And today is Friday and... Olive's singing continues but goes under. \n[14]Did you have to get a shot, Daddy? \n[15]Do I have to get a shot? \n[16]A million years? \n[17]No. \n[18]Like to smoke out of? \n[19]Every-single-where? \n[20]I don't want blood. I have blood?      \n[21]I don't want blood. Will it hurt? Will it hurt, Daddy?! \n[22]What's wrong with your face, Daddy? \n[23]I don't know what that means. \n[24]You could have both though. \n[25]Okay, pretend we're fairies. I'm a girl fairy and my name is ... La-ru...lee. And you're a boy fairy and your name is Teeteree. \n[26]What's my name again? \n[27]No. I said ... La-ru-la...ay. \n[28]Pretend we fight each other. And I say stop hitting me or I'll die. And you say okay, but you're fibbing. And you hit me again. \n[29]Okay. Let's go. Hit me. They pretend to hit each other. Olive makes hissing and roaring noises. She stops. \n[30]Okay. You have to stop hitting me now or I will die. \n[31]No! Pretend you're fibbing! Remember? He mock hits her again. She falls. \n[32]Now I have to die.  Pretend you say you don't want me to die. \n[33]But I have to. \n[34]I have to. And you'll have to wait a million years to see me again. Caden tears up at this and tries to conceal it. \n[35]And I'll be put in a box. And all I'll need is a tiny glass of water. And lots of -- tiny pieces of pizza. And the box will have wings, like an airplane. \n[36]Home. \n[37]Maria, would you leave us? Maria kisses Olive again on the forehead. \n[38]Forgive me but no longer remember English. Speak German?      \n[39]I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told you. The flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. So I am, as well. This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos. \n[40]Maria gave me reason to live once you left. The flowers defined me. \n[41]You did something. Caden is affected by this. It resonates. \n[42]I want to talk to you about your homosexuality. \n[43]Maria said you would deny it. \n[44]I had the same struggle when I first fell in love with Maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.      \n[45]Of course. She introduced me to myself. To my vagina and to hers. \n[46]I need to forgive you before I die, but I can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness. \n[47]I have no time! I need you to ask for forgiveness! \n[48]For what? \n[49]\"For abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover Eric.\" \n[50]No. No, I'm sorry, I cannot. Olive dies. Dead flower petals slip from her hospital gown. Caden sits there. Maria hurries rushes to Olive's side. ", "TAMMY": "\n[1]Uh-oh. This looks serious. Am I interrupting? \n[2]Just wanted to tell you the girl playing me is able to start today. \n[3]Okay. I'll take that as my cue. Tammy closes the door and leaves. \n[4]Hi, Caden. How was your night? \n[5]Eh. Philip was colicky. I was up all night. Caden looks over at Hazel for confirmation. She nods, slightly freaked out. \n[6]Sammy's not here. Jimmy called and said there's some subway problem. Jimmy rushes into the warehouse.      \n[7]Hi, Sammy. \n[8]Yeah. We'll take it from June 9th? Sammy nods, heads toward the set designer's office. \n[9]I don't know what he looks like. \n[10]Probably wasn't him then. \n[11]It's okay. \n[12]She's going to dinner with Sammy. \n[13]Don't forget your phone. \n[14]Every girl wants to be an actress. \n[15]I did. So I figure everyone does. \n[16]Who? \n[17]Where will you sleep? \n[18]Don't you want to sleep with me?      \n[19]I get undressed every day. \n[20]I don't see why. \n[21]I suppose it might. Do you want to fuck? \n[22]It'd be fine. Caden starts to cry. \n[23]Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I feel okay mostly. Fucking might help. \n[24]It's okay. I don't mind. Take your clothes off.      \n[25]Thanks. \n[26]You wish you were a chick? \n[27]Interesting. It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways. You like guys? \n[28]Well, I'm getting cold. She climbs into bed. \n[29]Take off your clothes. Caden does, awkwardly and shyly. He then stands there naked. Tammy smiles sweetly at him. \n[30]Pretty Caden. \n[31]Come to bed, Pretty Caden. Caden turns off the lights and climbs into the twin bed with Tammy. She looks at his face, then kisses him. \n[32]What is attractive? How are attractive people treated, how do they feel? How do unattractive people feel, how are they treated? How do attractive people feel about unattractive people, how do unattractive people feel about attractive people? How do unattractive people feel about other unattractive people? How do attractive people feel about other attractive people? How do unattractive men feel about unattractive women? How do unattractive men feel about attractive women? How do attractive men feel about unattractive women? How do attractive women feel about unattractive men? How do old people feel about attractive people? How do attractive people feel about old people? This is my study. Caden slows down. \n[33]Huh. Do you think we should have a Hazel's house on the set for me? \n[34]It would be verisimilitudinous. \n[35]It would be very verisimilitudinous if you could.     \n[36]My house! Tammy kisses Caden on the cheek and runs into the house. \n[37]Caden? Can we stop for a second? \n[38]If Hazel's in love with Sammy and Caden's in love with Hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where Caden turns to me and says, \"It's obvious he's a substitute for me.\" I think then Hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. I'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound. \n[39]I think Hazel would do that, Hazel. \n[40]Come over tonight? Please? \n[41]I'm hot. \n[42]He's directing.      ", "SAMMY": "\n[1]I've been following you for twenty years. So I knew about this audition. Because I follow you. Caden, hiding is nervousness, nods. \n[2]I've learned everything about you by following you. Hire me and you will see who you truly are. Caden stares at Sammy. Sammy stares back. There's fear in Caden's eyes but he doesn't drop his gaze. \n[3]Peek-a-boo. Sammy transforms effortlessly into Caden.      \n[4]Okay, Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to anyone else. This guy has me down. I'm going to cast him right now. Then maybe you and I can get a drink and we can try to figure out this thing between us. Why I cried. I've never felt about anyone the way I feel about you. I want to fuck you until we merge into a Chimera.       \n[5]A mythical beast with penis and vagina eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself. \n[6]I've never seen your shit gray. \n[7]I know it's pill time. You don't need to hide from me. Caden opens his pack and pulls out a baggie full of pills. He takes them, one-by-one. Sammy watches and counts. When it's over, he speaks. \n[8]You're missing your Fosonex.      \n[9]Fosonex, 2.5 mg. Caden picks the pill up off the floor. It's got grime on it. \n[10]Swallow it anyway. It's important. Go on, sweetie. Caden looks at Sammy and swallows the pill. \n[11]Good boy. \n[12]It'd be my honor to play your husband, Claire. You're an amazing actress. I saw you in Bernarda Alba last year at The Roundabout. \n[13]Start, huh? Caden chuckles. \n[14]Why did we leave Adele, Caden? \n[15]Amazing artist though. The best living artist. There's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. A sweet pussy, too. Caden looks at Sammy, confused. \n[16]Oh. I read it. \n[17]Maybe she's got a sublet in New York. Maybe the Met's doing a retrospective. Maybe, baby. He hands Caden a slip of paper. \n[18]I want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself. Research. For the part. Partner.     \n[19]You don't like Sammy? Why? I think he's good. \n[20]I'm not firing him, Claire. He's the best thing in the show. Next to you. \n[21]He's your husband. Claire turns to the real Caden and screams. \n[22]Caden, time out? \n[23]I've been going to Adele's place. And cleaning it. Long pause. Caden rubs his eyes. \n[24]What's going on, Hazel? \n[25]Maybe I will. \n[26]Claire, no. \n[27]Morning, Haze. \n[28]Okay. Yours? \n[29]Sorry. Everybody here? \n[30]Sammy likes you. Caden looks at Hazel. She nods. \n[31]Hazel, could you get everyone situated? I need to speak to Will about some new sets. Sammy pulls some Polaroids out of his backpack. \n[32]Hi, Caden. I'm being you. You like Hazel; I like Hazel. \n[33]Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note. \n[34]After me, Caden, there's no one left to watch you. They look up. Sammy stands on the ledge above them. \n[35]This is where we part ways. This is authentic. This is what the real Caden would do. This is what real love looks like. Sammy leaps. The actors below scatter. Sammy hits hard, breaks through the fake cement, and is dead. Blood everywhere.

He spots an unopened box next to the trash. It's pink with a picture of a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears come out. His eyes are dry and red. He pulls a vial of artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes. Suddenly his breathing becomes wildly erratic.     \n[8]Olive wants to see you. God knows why; the way you abandoned her. \n[9]Anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. God knows the fuck why. \n[10]This is him. \n[11]In heaven, my darling. Maria exits. \n[12]I hope you're happy, faggot. Caden gets up and leaves.     ", "TOM": "\n[1]Sssssh!! \n[2]Yeah? I was trying something different. I was crashing differently. Ambivalently. \n[3]Okay.      \n[4]Oh boy, oh boy. \n[5]It's all right, I came back. \n[6]No, nothing happened. \n[7]I said nothing happened. Didn't you hear me? \n[8]I'm tired to death. I couldn't make it. I just couldn't make it, Linda. \n[9]I got as far as a little above Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of coffee... maybe it was the coffee.      \n[10]I suddenly couldn't drive any more. The car kept going off onto the shoulder, y'know? The audience is rapt. Caden relaxes. \n[11]No. It's right. This is how they're supposed to fit. They're French. ", "MILLICENT'S VOICE": "\n[1]... touched by the sadness of Adele's neighbor. So close to death. Reminds me of granny. I should really call her. Remember how Granny Bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie. I loved that so much. Say thank you to Adele's neighbor. \n[2]Now say, have a very good day. \n[3]... miss him. Why did he have to get bored with me? Everyone gets bored with me. I'm not very bright. And since I put on that weight, I don't get the looks I used to. It's not that bad. Lots of people have it worse. I've got a job and place to stay. Adele is nice to me. And so smart and talented. I don't understand her artwork, but that's just me. I wish I'd gone to college. I feel stupid around educated people like Adele. Eric was too smart for me, too. We didn't talk at all near the end.       \n[4]I'd try to tell him about my day and he'd get this far away look in his eyes. I kind of felt sorry for him; he seemed so miserable with me. I guess -- Caden drifts off to sleep. \n[5]My period is late this month. I wonder what's going on. I'm bloated. I wish it would come. \n[6]I can't believe she said that to him! She's a slut, anyway. He sticks a bookmark in the book, puts it on the night table, turns off the light, and lies on his back with his eyes open. \n[7]Maybe I can ask Adele for a raise. It's been three years. I do a good job. God, I'm so tired tonight. I'm getting old. I'm lonely here. \n[8]Get up. Look at the night table for a note from Adele. Caden gets up and glances at the night table. A type-written \n[9]Look shocked. Weep. Caden looks shocked, then weeps. \n[10]Go into the kitchen and -- The voice stops. Caden stops. He waits. Nothing. He takes out the earpiece and looks at it, shakes it, then slips it back in his ear. Nothing. He waits. In the distance he hears wailing and gun shots. ", "MICHAEL": "\n[1]She's right? I didn't see that at all. I saw it all as more hopeful. \n[2]Any thoughts for today's rehearsal? \n[3]Huh. \n[4]Yes. I don't see what that has to do with anything. \n[5]No. \n[6]What's she doing? \n[7]She's not getting the feel of you, Caden. You don't move around. You don't talk to people.

She's looking into his eyes directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles. \n[8]You're going to be fine. Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.
