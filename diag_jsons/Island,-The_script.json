It's no use! \n[182]It's going too fast! \n[183]What did you give her? \n[184]S o you know about the baby... \n[185]I found your name in the listings. I wasn't sure.

They don't want people to know about her. Either of us. \n[190]Why ? So you can take her baby? \n[191]The y make you believe there's a place called The Island. Then they take you upstairs and put you to sleep. They cut you open. They take pieces of you. \n[192]N o . I saw a lot of us go to The Island. But I never saw anyone come back. \n[193]Is it? I wouldn't know. \n[194]C a n you help her? \n[195]I don't understand any of this. \n[196]He l l o , stranger. \n[197]Ester... \n[198]What do you mean? \n[199]I know. \n[200]No... \n[201]We have to go.

Take her somewhere they can't find her... \n[205]I can't find my sunglasses. I think I left them on the shuttle. \n[206]Don't worry. I'll catch up. \n[207]I t ' s been a year since the breakout. A year in hiding, waiting for things to quiet down. I don't know how many made i t out or how many who did, survived. I know there are people called politicians trying to say it never happened. That's why I've kept this journal. To keep the truth alive. Alive... I've learned what that means but it still confuses me. In functional terms, I've been alive for ten years. In human terms, more than thirty. Human... I'm not sure about that one either. They say I'm not human because I have no mother or father. I guess I have more to learn. But one word I do understand is hope. So maybe this j o u r n a l will give hope - to those like me, who may be out there. To know t h e y ' r e not alone. My name is Lincoln S i x - E c h o and this is my testament... \n[208]Lincoln Junior, huh? It still doesn't sound right. That name. \n[209]We should finish packing. \n[210]Time to go. \n[211]You'll make sure this gets out? \n[212]Thank you, Katherine. For everything. \n[213]I've been looking at them for months. \n[214]I don't need them either. ", "MERRICK": "\n[1]Good morning. To everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen, welcome to the community address. Today I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For those of you here with sugar quotas, let me recommend the french toast. I just tried some and it's excellent, really. But I know what everyone's hungry for s o let's move on to the lottery. As always the draw will be made from our host sector. So tell me, Sector Four - is everyone ready for The Daily Spin? \n[2]Let The Spin begin. \n[3]Starkweather Two-Delta! Step up! \n[4]Well , Starkweather, if you're watching on etherscreen - your time has come, my friend! You're moving out to The Island! And the rest of you, never lose hope; what do we know about The Daily Spin? \n[5]An d tomorrow it could be you... \n[6]Yes . Please, take a seat. \n[7]How ' s Lincoln Six-Echo today? \n[8]E v e r y t h i n g going okay? \n[9]Why do you say that? \n[10]I'm not sure I deserve such a negative association. My job's only to see that you're happy. That everything's okay. \n[11]I t sounds like you don't believe me. \n[12]I t ' s part of your makeup. To challenge things. To question what's around you. \n[13]P e r h a p s you can utilize that facility by helping me solve a little puzzle. \n[14]You're doing well in most areas - pro- f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously, your last medical puts you in excellent condition. But screening's picked up some deviations. Trace levels, changes in your sleep pattern... I see you've also been burning up your quotas... \n[15]No. \n[16]The r e are parameters, Lincoln. When someone starts straying from those parameters, we need to find out why. \n[17]Because you - not just you, all of our residents - are special. Because people like me don't get to go to The Island. \n[18]S o tell me, have you noticed any changes in yourself? \n[19]What about your sleep pattern? You feel you've been sleeping properly? \n[20]L e t me put it another way, when you wake up, do you feel... disrupted? \n[21]R e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy... \n[22]They're all words in your vocabulary. I know you understand what they mean. \n[23]Quotas . . . nutrition. Do you feel like you want more than you're given? \n[24]Do you have any difficulty staying focused? At work, for instance? \n[25]H a v e you been experiencing feelings, sensations you don't quite understand? \n[26]Do you sometimes feel agitated for no apparent reason? Frustrated, angry... \n[27]An g r y ? You feel angry? \n[28]When exactly do you feel angry? \n[29]I'm going to order some tests at The Medical Center. In the meantime, I'd like you to stay away from stimulants - protein, sugar, caffeine... \n[30]But I know you can get around them. \n[31]I'm asking you to cooperate. Not for my sake, Lincoln, but for your own. \n[32]The r e is one other thing. You have a female friend. \"Ester\". Your file shows you've been interacting regularly. \n[33]O f course not. We encourage interaction in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit. But given these deviations... let's just say proximity becomes an issue. \n[34]The rules of proximity apply to sexual contact, Lincoln. In this case it goes deeper than that. Ester is entering h e r second trimester. A time of change and emotional confusion. Further inter- a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you. \n[35]An d for Ester - well, she has only six months left to delivery. Then she'll move out to The Island and whatever ties she has here will be broken. \n[36]A s a friend, shouldn't you make her t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible? \n[37]G o o d . Now I'm also going to refill your pleasure quota. It may help to settle you down a little. \n[38]I'm not sure you do. But I think you'll do what's right, Lincoln. You may not trust me. But I trust you. \n[39]K a r l . . . Welcome back. \n[40]J u s t a histamine reflex. Your system's readjusting to the sterile environment. \n[41]Yes , well I cut short your leave for a reason. I take it you've been briefed? \n[42]His name is Starkweather Two-Delta. He dropped off the ether two days ago. At first we thought it was a system error. Then we found this in a garbage chute. \n[43]That's right. \n[44]T h a t was entirely different. The product suffered a head injury. \n[45]We don't know. He just disappeared. \n[46]He's a code two, Karl. A low functioner. \n[47]The y don't function mentally, they don't function physically - you know that. \n[48]I f you bothered to read the clone laws, you'd realize we have no choice in the matter. The virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms. All we can do is prescribe the limits. And even those are subject to regulation. Scope of knowledge, range of activity, even their speech patterns. The law requires that what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics. \n[49]The ether shows no attempts on the boundary. He's here, Karl. But for some reason, your men seem unable to find him. It's your job to contain the products. I'd like you to do it, okay? \n[50]J u s t after Starkweather went missing, his sponsor placed an order. An order we can't fill. Damn right I'm sensitive. \n[51]J a m i l Starkweather . . . last week he sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in liver hemorrhage. In medical terms, we have maybe a few weeks. In legal terms, we're already o n borrowed time... An d Karl? \n[52]I don't want a godawful m e s s like the l a s t time. Minimal damage. Understood? \n[53]There's nothing going on, Karl. \n[54]What's your point? \n[55]You're jumping to conclusions. \n[56]Q u a l i t y control is not your concern. \n[57]That's not what I said. \n[58]It's not an exact science - biogenesis. There's a degree of trial and error. If the agnate doesn't come together on the first pass, we have to abort and start over. It's like breaking inertia. The bioreactor, the growth medium - we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration. At which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable. We rely on foundation to provide mental stability - matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters. When signs of instability started to show up, it pointed to foundation. A hole in the wall, an oversight. But it was only happening in the later generat- ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis. \n[59]Actually the opposite. We found out in the later generations, the levels were so high that when we broke inertia, the process kept going. Over-integrating. Specifically the neural system. It produced a condition called synesthesia. \n[60]A fusion of the senses, creating a component awareness. Sixth sense, s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call it. Its emergence seems to be arbitrary. But it gives them experiences beyond their functional parameters. And ultimately... it destabilizes them. However, if we catch it early enough we can control it with re-conditioning. \n[61]You find this amusing? \n[62]Poetic? \n[63]This stays between you and me, Karl. I trust I can rely on your cooperation? \n[64]Remind me, why is it you were discharged from the military? \n[65]Learn to be a team player, Karl. Or you'll find yourself out of another job. \n[66]Thank you for coming out here. \n[67]First, let me stress there's no way we could have anticipated what happened... \n[68]We'v e lost two of our products. They escaped containment last night. \n[69]We'r e still piecing it together. \n[70]To answer your question, we condition our products with a deterrent. A fear of contamination. And thereby of the outer environment. So to escape, they first have to escape their conditioning. \n[71]\n[72]\n[73]\n[74]\n[75]Well . . . the male, we could cover. Fast- track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access. The female comes under the maternity plan. She's three months pregnant. Even if we fast- tracked another generation, we couldn't fast-track the pregnancy. We'd miss the delivery date, the sponsor would wonder why and there would be... difficulties. \n[76]I just don't think we should under- estimate them. Especially the male. \n[77]Bad news. \n[78]The male agnate tracked him down. \n[79]I told her, Henry. About synesthesia. \n[80]We had no choice, Karl. We had to keep this away from The Institute. \n[81]Your resignation papers. Maybe `early retirement' would be more accurate... \n[82]T e n platinum bounty - if you sign the papers, their loss becomes your gain. \n[83]You understand that whatever happens, The Institute must be able to deny it. \n[84]We use a chemical to dispose of waste product. It's called di-halcyonate. I t reacts on a molecular level to start a process of internal combustion. The subject is incinerated from the inside out. In post-mortem application it's done its job before rigor mortis. In a live subject, well... you can imagine. \n[85]I t ' s a little more complicated than that. We have to be very... thorough. If you still have it in you, that is. \n[86]I don't know. \n[87]S o you wear it is a badge of honor? \n[88]You'll find a vehicle parked outside. It's unregistered, difficult to trace. I take it we have an agreement...? \n[89]An d it's a terrible loss. \n[90]E t h e r c o n ! Ether control, come in! \n[91]An y o n e ! Somebody pick up! \n[92]How wide is this going?

Just for tests but they had me on liquid nutrition. Mmmmm. This is the first solid food I've had in a week. \n[5]That's not the exciting part. I got my first trimester report: happy, healthy and contaminant-free... Both of us. \n[6]My baby... It's in perfect condition. I just hope I can keep it that way. I still have six months to delivery. \n[7]Why? Will you miss me? \n[8]Okay. But this is the last time. \n[9]What is it? \n[10]Don't worry.

But let's just say industrial secrets are involved. \n[42]Any good at keeping them? \n[43]All I'm authorized to tell you is they have no records in this state. Also that they're not armed or dangerous. \n[44]John and Jane Doe... \n[45]Because you won't have to look. They jumped an overnight shuttle. They'll be headed for the terminal, trying to get out of state. It's strictly a recovery job. For you, it should be childsplay. \n[46]The parties I represent want to stay at arm's length.

Once you have them, you'll contact me for further instructions. \n[48]I told you we shouldn't have gone to outside personnel. They were cowboys. \n[49]An d now? \n[50]What's this? \n[51]A parachute... So there's a jump? \n[52]You want to dispose of your products. \n[53]Why do you think I still wear this? \n[54]I was discharged from the marines for insubordination. If you asked anyone i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. I disobeyed an order to fall back. I took out a bunker complex single-handed. \n[55]N o . It wasn't bravery. I wasn't afraid of dying. I just didn't care. You see, I suddenly realized I was just a sack of flesh with a heartbeat. Life, death, I just couldn't see the point anymore. \n[56]I'm from the Sanger Institute. \n[57]I t ' s just a formality.

Didn't stop Burdie though . `Took down that fucker with one arm, didn't you? \n[3]Well we're on the job, see? And it kind of helps if you bleed in. You don't look like a bondman either. \n[4]Now that's what people use when they don't want to get their hands dirty. \n[5]What we hunt depends on the bounty. \n[6]What's the bond? \n[7]Ten platinum.

Sweep for blue card transactions. \n[29]I want serial numbers, batched a n d cross-referenced. Start from Union Station and work your way out... \n[30]We got a positive on the serial number. Punch in and pull up the transactions. Start with the last hour and work back. \n[31]I t ' s a platinum bond, Janeen. We get this, I'll buy you a new ass, okay? \n[32]Bond recovery... state license. \n[33]Play nice, little girl. Now you want to tell me where your boyfriend is? \n[34]What? \n[35]I'm a bond agent! \n[36]Punch into the currency stream, close the net on downtown and keep the search active.

Deaf and dumb? \n[44]Somebody start talking. \n[45]Up there in the rocks. Three o'clock. I'm not sure... it could be ambient. \n[46]Burdie...? ", "CROWNE": "\n[1]Good morning, gentlemen. \n[2]Well when Henry called me I got the sense it wasn't for a social visit. \n[3]I understand there was an incident? \n[4]We're on the same team, Mr. Merrick. Just give me the facts down-and-dirty. \n[5]How exactly did this happen? \n[6]Do we expect more products to escape? \n[7]I'm sorry, Henry, but you asked me here to assess our liabilities. \n[8]Containment is one of the terms of our state health license. The fact it was compromised could put us in violation. \n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]Let's take the drastic case. What then? \n[16]We haven't even touched on the worst. If these products reach a populated area, there's the problem of scrutiny. \n[17]We slipped through a loophole in the clone laws, Henry. And they only let u s through because they smelt money. And they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not ours. It's at the core of our license - why we screen potential sponsors, why we make them sign discretion agreements, why containment is such a critical factor - to limit the extent of public scrutiny. \n[18]Something to add, Mr. Merrick? \n[19]Gentlemen, whatever happens we need t o keep one thing clearly in mind. As far as the world at large goes, we are just another medical services company. Anything that alters that perception puts us at risk. And we cannot rely on the sanction of the law to protect us. Whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we recover these products, we have to stay beyond reproach. All it takes is one nudge to put us in the spotlight. Then you'll see how fast politicians can run for cover. \n[20]I take it you've heard the news. \n[21]Unfortunate? We're way past unfortunate, Henry. \n[22]The police won't connect the bond agents to us. But that's not the problem. It's the sponsor. \n[23]His name's Thomas Lincoln. It seems they had a genetic reunion. Not a h a p p y one. It was all I could do to stop him going to the authorities. \n[24]He may not want a police involvement but he's already threatened to file suit. And he's one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city. \n[25]That's why I asked Bernard to come out here. To find out how it happened. \n[26]That's not the point. Whether or not it's a factor in this instance, it puts us in breach of the clone laws. \n[27]I'm talking about self-awareness. The virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the l e v e l of functionality. But not beyond. \n[28]L e g a l l y , we are naked on every level. Federal legislature, state licensing, sponsorship contract... But even if we did manage to weather the legal storm, we'd never survive the public scrutiny. \n[29]You remember cryogenics? At the outset, people dismissed it as a rich man's folly. Eccentric millionaires freezing their brains, hoping to wake up in a new body. \n[30]E v e n when cloning showed signs of m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. It w a s the scope. The scope, Henry. When t h e size of the customer base was e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality - one m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the p o o r . The pressure for accessible cryo- genics a s good as buried the industry. O u r graves are being dug as we speak, g e n t l e m e n . Every passing second, they g e t deeper. If we're going to survive, w e have to act swiftly and decisively. \n[31]O u r security chief - I've been looking at his file. Ex-marine, served in South China - do we think he still has it in him? \n[32]` You ever wondered why Henry takes those pills, Bernard? Why he doesn't avail himself of his own technology? \n[33]B u l l s h i t , Henry. Bullshit. You don't want to deal with reality. Only with concept. I may not have been there at the start but I heard the stories. You wanted in on every aspect of construction, from environmental design right down to the classical playlists. I t wasn't enough just to make it work, was it? No, you wanted your own little utopia. \n[34]Swanning a r o u n d in your mountain r e t r e a t like some self-appointed d e i t y . But when it comes to getting y o u r hands dirty... \n[35]E v e n God has blood on his hands, Henry. Are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it? \n[36]What's your point? \n[37]M r s . Ester? My name is Ellen Crowne. \n[38]L e g a l issues must seem trivial at this time. But the sponsorship agreement has certain conditions relating to confident- i a l i t y . D e s p i t e this tragic t u r n of events, those conditions remain binding. We want to be sure you understand that. \n[39]T h a t said, The Institute is likewise bound by the terms of sponsorship and while we reserve every right... \n[40]L e g a l l y , human rights don't apply. \n[41]We do have other issues to discuss... \n[42]We l l , I don't know about the two of you but I'd say we got off lightly. \n[43]Don't start getting maudlin, Henry. It's a little too late in the game. ", "KATHERINE": "\n[1]O h , God... Oh, my God... \n[2]J u s t something to help her sleep. I think she has a bronchial infection. But I'm not sure I should give her an antibiotic in case it effects the baby. \n[3]Is n ' t that why you came here? \n[4]The y have a plan... For women like me. \n[5]You know when you're young? How you run around thinking you're immortal? \n[6]The r e was a lodeway accident. I was... damaged. After that, I thought no man would ever want me. I was wrong. His name was John. He said he married me for my eyes. Ocean eyes, he called them. He always loved the ocean. Up there on the wall, that's John's boat. \n[7]But I think there was always an unspoken regret between us. When we heard about the technology, it was like... forgive- n e s s , like a second chance. A child of our own, part of both of us. Sailing trips, fishing trips, so many plans... J o h n got cancer a year ago. He died. \n[8]I r o n i c . That the same technology could have saved his life. And now the baby is the only part of him I have left. And the boat. I still have the boat. \n[9]What do I call you? \n[10]Lincoln , I think she needs professional help. I think she needs to see a doctor. \n[11]N o t if I don't want them to. \n[12]The doctor I'm thinking of, he's an old friend. He look after John in t h e final stages. I trust him. \n[13]N o . No, that's not what I want. \n[14]M a y b e I didn't realize she'd      be so... M a y b e I just didn't want to.      Either way, I was wrong. I want you          to know that. I was wrong... And I'm          sorry. \n[15]E v e n if I had taken her baby, I swear to you, I'd never have... They give you a choice, you see, to extend the sponsorship after... after d e l i v e r y . \n[16]You mean... Even if I had extended the sponsorship, they'd have... and kept taking the money? But that's inhuman. \n[17]We l l I've been keeping busy. Trying to. Thanks for coming down to meet me. \n[18]I t ' s not me... Not exactly. \n[19]He means that by trying to help her, we could lose her. Or lose the baby. \n[20]What are you talking about? \n[21]I see. \n[22]You can stop there. I know why I'm here. You wanted to know if I'm going to sue you for breach of contract. \n[23]I don't want restitution, Dr. Sanger. The reason I agreed to this meeting was to have the chance to talk to you. \n[24]I never got to meet you when I visited The Institute. It was one of your sales- m e n who led the tour. I remember how h e described the agnates a s if they were some kind of mindless organisms. More like livestock than humanity... \n[25]I remember how eager I was to believe him. But when I saw w h a t I'd created, in flesh and blood, when I touched h e r , it was I who felt less than human. \n[26]Ester ' s life was my responsibility and her death is my cross to bear alone. So I'm not going to sue you, Dr. Sanger... But I am going to blame y o u . Until the day I die, I will silently curse your name. That's w h a t I wanted you to know. \n[27]An d now I'd like to leave, please. \n[28]I don't think they suspected anything. \n[29]I know... But it felt good. It felt like something John would have done. \n[30]Yes . There are people sympathetic to the cause. I'm going to get it to them. \n[31]Don't forget that.

What do you want? \n[6]One of the partners at my firm... he told me about it. Gave me a referral. I thought he was joking at first. I went out there, took the sales tour.
