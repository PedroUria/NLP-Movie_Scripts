{"dialogues": {"BELLA": "\n[1]I'd never given much thought to how I would die..  Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near.  Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.   \n[2]But dying in the place of someone I love seems like a good way to go.. .   -- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of -   \n[3]... So I can't bring myself to regret the decision that brought me here to die...   The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in -   2. \n[4]... The decision to leave home.  She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until   \n[5]Have a good..  --and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone.   \n[6]... life.   Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and innate intelligence become apparent as - -   BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She thrusts a cell phone at Bella.   \n[7]You put it on hold.   \n[8]Look. You also called Mexico.   Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.    3. \n[9]Very romantic.   PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease.   \n[10]I won't change my mind, mom.   \n[11]It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.   (off Rene's still worried look Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.   But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car.. .   \n[12]I cut it since last time I saw you.   \n[13]Good.   More silence. Yikes. They pass a SIGN: \u0093The City Of Forks Welcomes You - Pop. 3246.\u0094 Bella sighs.    5. \n[14]That's right. One bathroom.   Bella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and Rene, on vacation, beaming with love.   \n[15]I can do it -   They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.   \n[16]Yeah... I think I remember.. .  Are they always like this?   \n[17]No way. The truck is for me?   \n[18]It's perfect!    7. She beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her. She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her.   \n[19]Maybe I can give you a ride to school.   \n[20]Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.   As she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT -   \n[21]I'm kind of the \u0093suffer in silence\u0094 type.   \n[22]I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all -   \n[23]Would you mind just pointing me toward Mr. Varner's class?   He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them -   \n[24]Are you alright? I warned them not to make me play.   \n[25]Just Bella.   \n[26]That's why they kicked me out.   Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just feels uncomfortable with the attention.. .   \n[27]Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team -   \n[28]Who are they?   \n[29]Who's he?   \n[30]I wasn't planning on it.   But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair.   \n[31]Jerk.   As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH -   \n[32]That'd be great, thank you.   Cora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the ketchup instead. Silence as they eat.   A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap.   \n[33]So... you eat here every night?   \n[34]I can cook.   He looks up, as if confused by the concept.   \n[35]I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.   \n[36]A few people... Do you know the Cullen family?   \n[37]No... well, a little.   \n[38]... Okay.   \n[39]Mom, where's your cell?   \n[40]They've all been really.. .   welcoming.   PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as.. .   \n[41]Dad, I'm heading out. \n[42]Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. \n[43]Dad, I can drive myself to school.   As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's watching her - - \n[44]Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.   \n[45]You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before.   Charlie looks at her, confused.   \n[46]I mean... nothing.   He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.   \n[47]An animal?   \n[48]Be careful.   \n[49]And thank you. For the tires.   He sees emotion in her eyes. Doesn't understand it, but nods, heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved.. .   \n[50]Terrific.   She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she freezes when she sees --Edward.   Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address him. But he looks up at her -   \n[51]I'm... yes.   Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to the extreme edge of his seat. She's even more baffled now.   \n[52]You've been gone.   \n[53]Prophase.   She begins to remove the slide.   \n[54]Like I said.   He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.   \n[55]Seriously? You're asking me about the weather?   \n[56]No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.   Is that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating.    22. \n[57]What?   He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out   the slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking.. .   \n[58]May I?  (she looks through the lens Anaphase.   \n[59]It's complicated.   \n[60]My mother remarried.   \n[61]Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough.    Interphase.   \n[62]Alright, Phil's a minor league   baseball player, so he travels a   lot. My mother stayed home with me   but it made her unhappy. So \n[63]No... I -- I just.. .   Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable.   \n[64]Did you get contacts?   \n[65]Your eyes were black before, now   they're this golden brown or -   \n[66]I'm fine, dad. Calm down.   \n[67]It's okay, Tyler.   \n[68]Dad, it's not his fault-   \n[69]But you didn't.   He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was. Instead, he glares at Tyler.   \n[70]It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.   \n[71]It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.   \n[72]You told her?! She's probably freaking.   He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall.. .   \n[73]Can I talk to you for a moment?  How did you get over to me so quickly?   \n[74]You were next to your car, across the lot.   He steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard.   \n[75]Yes. You were.   \n[76]I know what I saw.   \n[77]You stopped that van. You pushed it away.   \n[78]I wasn't planning to tell anyone.   This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other, the tension thick.   \n[79]I just want to know the truth.   \n[80]Thank you.    28. A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and without a doubt, attracted.   \n[81]No.   \n[82]Why did you even bother?   He stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable.   \n[83]... Yeah, false alarm.. .   \n[84]Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go   -somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah. \n[85]Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.   Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica. She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of Jessica. He seems to be smirking.. .    30. \n[86]Hello, Edward.   He glances at her, merely nodding. We notice his FISTS clench, and unclench. Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.   \n[87]Really?   No response. She turns, starts to walk away.   \n[88]How did you know about that?   \n[89]You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.   \n[90]And how did you stop that van?   \n[91]Floridians. That's what's in Jacksonville.   She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so powerful... He clenches his jaw.   \n[92]No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.   \n[93]Too bad you didn't figure that out earlier.       32. \n[94]You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.   \n[95]I know you do.   \n[96]Your fault, for telling her about the accident.   \n[97]He is.   She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO. Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT - -    33. \n[98]Should I know what that means?   \n[99]I'll go if you stop saying that.   \n[100]Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.   \n[101]What does that even mean?   \n[102]So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?   \n[103]Okay... how \u0091bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?   \n[104]No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away.   He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her.. .   \n[105]Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.. .   \n[106]La Push.    35. His smile lessens almost imperceptibly.   \n[107]Is something wrong with that beach?   Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.   \n[108]You could ask him. (off Angela's flustered   look Take control. You're a strong independent woman.   \n[109]Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?   \n[110]Definitely not.   \n[111]To be polite.   \n[112]You know them?   \n[113]You want to go look at tide pools?   She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins, infatuated. As they head toward the water.. .   \n[114]So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?   \n[115]I can keep a secret.. .    37. \n[116]Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?   Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue.. .   \n[117]So the legend about the Cullens is.. .   \n[118]Didn't they just move here?   \n[119]Riiiight. So what was this treaty?   \n[120]Wait... what were they really?   \n[121]They just... ditch?   \n[122]It's a family thing.   \n[123]Port Angeles?.. . (a plan forming in her mind Can I go with you guys?   \n[124]It looks great.   \n[125]Maybe I should just go check out the   book store and meet you at the   restaurant later.   \n[126]Look, just take my bag.   \n[127]What -- no, how did you find -- ?   \n[128]No. Bad idea.   \n[129]And you do?   \n[130]Okay, well. Thank you.   She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly -   \n[131]I could eat.   As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and a noiseless scream of excitement.   \n[132]You're not eating?   \n[133]Like South Beach?   \n[134]So how \u0091bout some answers?   \n[135]I didn't ask for the square root of pi.   \n[136]How did you know where I was?   \n[137]Were you following me?   \n[138]So that's a yes?   \n[139]You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. . Can you... read minds?   \n[140]Alright, so you read minds... What am I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go.    45. \n[141]Why, what's wrong with me?   \n[142]What is it?   \n[143]Edward, you don't have to.   He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.   \n[144]Edward -   \n[145]I think I'm warm enough now.   She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric current connecting them.   \n[146]Your hand, it's still freezing cold.   He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is parked out front.   \n[147]Dad's here late. Something must have happened.   \n[148]He died? How?   \n[149]The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?   Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.    47. \n[150]So it's getting closer to town.   \n[151]But that's -   \n[152]Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.   \n[153]That's probably not a good -    48. \n[154]... it's not possible.. . Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. . \n[155]You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time.    You never eat food, or drink, or come out in the sunlight. And you said no to the beach trip only after you heard where it was. Because of the treaty.   This last registers with him. She steps closer to him.   \n[156]How old are you?   \n[157]How long have you been seventeen?   A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.   \n[158]I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.   \n[159]... Vampire   They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her reality utterly rocked.   \n[160]No.    51. \n[161]You won't hurt me. You're different.   \n[162]Where are we going?   \n[163]No! The sunlight will kill you.   \n[164]Slow down.   Suddenly, he's right next to her.   \n[165]No.   \n[166]I'm not afraid.   \n[167]No!   But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead -   THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly-   Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. Then she realizes she's alone.   \n[168]Edward? Where are you?   She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into -   \n[169]You're... beautiful.. .   He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again.   \n[170]I don't believe that.   \n[171]I don't care.   \n[172]It doesn't matter.    54. \n[173]I trust you.   \n[174]I trust you, Edward. I'm here.   She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.   \n[175]Edward?   She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, catching his breath.   \n[176]Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.   \n[177]I know you can.    55. He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her face for clues.   \n[178]I'm afraid.   Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.   \n[179]Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.   \n[180]Stupid lamb.   \n[181]How long have you been like this?   \n[182]Where'd he find you?   \n[183]Does someone have to be dying to become like you?.. .   Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to -   \n[184]So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.   \n[185]Show off.   \n[186]Can they all read minds, too?   \n[187]Really? Bet she saw me coming a mile away.   She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.   \n[188]Your house? With your family?    59. He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the truck's body. She's too flustered to register it.   \n[189]But... what if they don't like me?   \n[190]I'm glad I amuse you.   But then his laughter dies, as he hears something.   \n[191]What is it?   \n[192]Come to visit your truck?   \n[193]A person did that?   \n[194]It's... wonderful. \n[195]No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.   82 \n[196]It's so light and open.   \n[197]Bon giorno?   \n[198]Oh, absolutely -   \n[199]I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.. .   \n[200]I would never, ever tell anyone.   \n[201]... Badly?   This hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her.   \n[202]Oh. Badly. Like, where I become a meal.   Emmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle.   Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett shrugs, goes after her.    64. \n[203]And you're Jasper, right?   \n[204]Graduation caps?   \n[205]What a nightmare, repeating high school.    65. \n[206]So you're obsessed with music. But.. .  No bed?   \n[207]Ever?   \n[208]Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. .   \n[209]I'd have to say... Debussy.   He looks at her, surprised, smiles.   \n[210]No dancing.   \n[211]No tripping, no falling, no derision.   \n[212]You don't scare me.   \n[213]Don't you dare -  Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE DECK... then she finds herself -   IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too.. .   \n[214]In theory.   \n[215]Everyone's staring. \n[216]Sorry I'm late. Biology project.   Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella.   \n[217]Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.   \n[218]Yeah, me, too.   \n[219]He's just a friend.   \n[220]We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?   \n[221]I've never minded being alone. Guess I'm a lot like my dad that way.   Charlie smiles. These two have come a long way. Cora returns -   \n[222]So spring training's going well?   \n[223]Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.   \n[224]Maybe.. .   \n[225]Well... he is kind of a history buff.   -- this as she turns to find -   EDWARD LYING ON HER BED, smiling. She nearly drops the phone.   \n[226]I, uh... have to go.   \n[227]I'll call you later, Mom.   STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.   \n[228]How did you get in here?   \n[229]You've been here before?   \n[230]You're a peeping Tom! Perv!   \n[231]Oh... I'm... oh.   He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face.   \n[232]Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.   \n[233]I have a date with Edward Cullen.   He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm.   \n[234]We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.   \n[235]Edward doesn't live \u0093in town.\u0094 And it's in the early stage and - - whatever, he's outside right now.   \n[236]He wants to meet you. Officially.   \n[237]Be nice, okay? He's... important.   Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves.   \n[238]Dad.   \n[239]No fair, reading Charlie's mind.   As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat -   \n[240]And since when do vampires like baseball?   \n[241]Now I get why you need the thunder.   The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing through the trees. Edward disappears after it.   \n[242]That has to be a home run.   \n[243]Yer out?   Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe!   JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS.   \n[244]What?!? Charlie's there. He's in danger because of me. Because of us!   \n[245]I said, leave me alone!   \n[246]Get out! It's over.   She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.   \n[247]I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.   Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her -   \n[248]I can't hurt him.   Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK.   INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them.   \n[249]No, Dad.   \n[250]I broke up with him.   \n[251]That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.   \n[252]She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.   \n[253]I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise.   She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows.. .    81. \n[254]Like watch more baseball on the flat   screen? Or go to the Coffee Shop?   Same people, same steak, same berry   cobbler every night? That's you,   Dad. Not me.   This hits Charlie hard. She can barely stand it, heads down the stairs, as he takes a second to recover.. .   \n[255]And if I don't get out now, I'm   going get stuck here like mom did.   Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes advantage of his shock, pushing past him out the door.   \n[256]His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.   \n[257]This is insane. You can't put yourselves in danger like this - for me.   \n[258]If any of you get hurt because of me -   \n[259]Mom, it's me again. You must have   let your phone die. Anyway, I'm   not in Forks anymore but I'm okay.   I'll explain when you call.   She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face -  \n[260]I wish he'd call.   \n[261]They could get hurt. It's not worth it.   \n[262]How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.   \n[263]So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?   \n[264]No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.   \n[265]Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years.   \n[266]No. Hell, no. I hated the place.   Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out. Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS. She picks it up. Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief. She answers.. .    88. \n[267]Edward. Are you alright?   \n[268]This is my fault. You warned me, but I didn't think. I just.. .   \n[269]No... we can't.  When will you get here?   \n[270]Mom, I'm so glad you got my - -    89. \n[271]Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every -   HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.   \n[272]... Mom? Are you there?   Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine -   \n[273]Leave my mother out of this.   \n[274]I... don't think so.    90. \n[275]Where should I meet you?   James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor.   \n[276]8th and Palo Verde, please.   The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW.. .    91. \n[277]Everyone makes fun of me.   \n[278]Mom, I suck.   LAUGHTER behind Bella. She spins, trying to locate James in the mirrors.   \n[279]She's not here.   \n[280]Edward has nothing to do with this.    93. \n[281]No! Edward, don't.. .    94. James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face -   \n[282]It's on fire! My hand!   \n[283]It's burning!   \n[284]Life... is harder.. . An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. \n[285]Edward? Where's - \n[286]What... happened?   \n[287]Sounds like me.    98. Rene's cell phone BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts typing in a reply.   \n[288]Mom, you're... texting.   \n[289]That's great mom.   \n[290]Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad.. .    ... and friends.. .   \n[291]What do you think?   \n[292]Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? \n[293]Is James - did you -- ?   \n[294]I'm alive because of you.   \n[295]But you did.   \n[296]What? No! I want to be with you! \n[297]Alice lent me the dress. It was the   only thing that would fit over my   cast. Is it too... ?   \n[298]Dad.   \n[299]I can't believe you're making me do   this.   He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to.. .   \n[300]You really are trying to kill me.   \n[301]You're serious.   He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.   \n[302]At prom.   As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.    102. \n[303]Edward... why did you save me?  If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now.   \n[304]I want you. Always.   \n[305]I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older  \n[306]Not the way Alice saw it.  I heard her. She saw me like you.  \n[307]Based on what someone decides. And I've decided.   He looks at her, angry.   \n[308]I dream about being with you forever.   \n[309]Yes.   He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take.    103. \n[310]Yes.   His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.   \n[311]For now.   They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms.. .   \n[312]No one will surrender tonight. But I won't give in. I know what I want.   CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..  ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..  VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES filled with vengeance as we -   ", "EDWARD": "\n[1]There must be something open sixth   period. Physics? Biochem?   \n[2]I'll just... endure it.   He strides out the door. Off Bella.. .   \n[3]Hello.   Bella stops. Stunned. He is direct, precise, as if every word is an effort for him.   \n[4]I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.   She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer.   \n[5]... You're Bella.   \n[6]Ladies first.   She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him.   \n[7]Out of town. For personal reasons.   She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face tight. She looks back into the microscope.   \n[8]May I look?   She slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens.   \n[9]Prophase.   \n[10]Enjoying the rain?   \n[11]It appears.   \n[12]Anaphase. She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. \n[13]Like I said.   She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply holds out her hand for another slide.   \n[14]If you hate cold and rain, why move to the wettest place in the continental U.S.   \n[15]I think I can keep up.   He actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as -   \n[16]Very complex. So you don't like him.   \n[17]Why didn't you stay with your mom   and stepdad?   He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.   \n[18]But now you're unhappy.   \n[19]I'm just trying to figure you out.   You're very hard to read.   He's clearly trying to read her now... their eyes meet again. But now she looks more closely at him.   \n[20]... no.   \n[21]It's just the fluorescents.   He abruptly turns and walks away. As he does, Bella notes - - HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists. Off Bella, utterly bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.   \n[22]I was standing right next to you.   \n[23]No, I wasn't.   She won't be bullied. Steps closer to him.   \n[24]You're confused. You hit your head.   \n[25]And what, exactly, was that?   \n[26]No one will believe that.   \n[27]Can't you just thank me and get over it?   \n[28]You're not going to let it go, are you?   \n[29]Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.   \n[30]... I don't know.   And he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.   \n[31]What's in Jacksonville?   She turns back to him.   \n[32]You didn't answer my question.   \n[33]Hello.   \n[34]Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.    31. \n[35]It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.   Insulted, she keeps moving. He keeps pace, serious now.   \n[36]I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.   She just looks at him like he's crazy. He walks away as Jessica suddenly rushes up.   \n[37]Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.   \n[38]You think I regret saving you?   \n[39]You don't know anything.   His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity.   \n[40]No. Our bus is full.   He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it.   \n[41]Edible art.. .   Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. He presents it to her with small smile.   \n[42]I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.    34. \n[43]It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.   Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table.   She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this conversation from their table. Mike glowers jealously.   \n[44]Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.   \n[45]You're talking about superheroes. What if I'm not a hero? What if I'm a bad guy?   \n[46]Which beach?   \n[47]It's just a little crowded.   Off Bella, as Edward walks away.. .   \n[48]Get in.   She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and rushes Edward's side of the car -   Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.   \n[49]I should go back and rip their heads off.   \n[50]You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.   \n[51]Not hard to guess.   \n[52]Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking.    43. \n[53]Maybe I should make sure Bella gets something to eat.   (off Bella's surprised   look ... If you'd like. Then I could drive you back myself.   \n[54]I'm on a special diet.   \n[55]Not exactly.   She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.    44. \n[56]Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.   \n[57]You knew that?   \n[58]I didn't.   She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside - -   \n[59]Don't go.   He seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally.. .   \n[60]I feel very protective of you.   \n[61]Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help.   \n[62]I'm thinking of getting a nine- hundred number.   \n[63]I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours.   (points at people inside Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend -  Nothing. It's quite frustrating.   \n[64]I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?   He smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out.   \n[65]I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.   She's surprised. And thrilled.   \n[66]This is wrong.   \n[67]You're cold. We should go.   He walks away before she can ask any more questions.. .   \n[68]That's my father's car. What's he -- ?   \n[69]Carlisle. What happened?   \n[70]Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.   \n[71]Seventeen.   \n[72]... A while.   She inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE \n[73]Say it. Out loud. Say it.   All sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper.. .   \n[74]Are you afraid?   \n[75]Then ask me the most basic question: what do we eat?   \n[76]You think you know me?   He glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes her by the hand. Starts walking.   \n[77]Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what \n[78]Myth. You need to see the truth.   He pulls her but she stumbles.   \n[79]Are you afraid?   \n[80]Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where \n[81]You should be.    52. He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms.   \n[82]Hold on.   Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.   \n[83]Are you afraid! ?   \n[84]This is why we don't show ourselves   in sunlight.. .   As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He moves toward her.    53. \n[85]This is what I am.   He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but.. .   \n[86]Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. This is the skin of a killer.   His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.   \n[87]Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if \n[88]As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.   He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against a tree trunk with explosive force.   Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable.   \n[89]I'm designed to kill.   \n[90]I've killed people.   \n[91]I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you.   \n[92]Don't.   \n[93]You... took me by surprise.  I don't know how to... do this.   He moves back toward her. Slowly.   \n[94]Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. .    But you - your scent, it's like a drug to me... my own personal brand of heroin.   \n[95]I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.   He reaches her again.   \n[96]I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes.. .    I can't read your mind. Tell me what you're thinking.   \n[97]Good.   She sinks down in front of him.   \n[98]You don't know how long I've looked for you.   They share a smile. Then he reaches toward her neck, pausing.. .   \n[99]Be very still.   She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.   He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her heart... Clouds float past the sun.. .   They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.   \n[100]And so the lion fell for the lamb.   \n[101]Sick masochistic lion.    56. CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as they dare... his hand to her heart.. .   \n[102]Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.   She takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity.   \n[103]In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died.    57. FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT   \n[104]Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. . frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop.   \n[105]First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.   BACK to PRESENT DAY   \n[106]... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice.   \n[107]Not the only reason.   He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion.. .    58. \n[108]I don't want to be a monster.   She nods. Understands. He smiles.   \n[109]We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying.   Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing on a large rock in the river.   \n[110]It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this.   \n[111]No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future.   \n[112]Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.   He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and continuing their walk.. .   \n[113]Come to my house tomorrow.   Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof.   \n[114]You're worried, not because you'll be in a houseful of vampires, but because you think they won't approve of you?   \n[115]A complication.   ... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up.   \n[116]I'll pick you up tomorrow.   He heads to his car, eying the passengers in -   \n[117]You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? \n[118]Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide.   We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen. Edward shakes his head. \n[119]I told them not to do this.    62. \n[120]This is Esme, my mother for all   intents and purposes.   \n[121]She already ate.   Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS. Rosalie has thrown down a bowl and now strides out -   \n[122]Ignore her. I do.   \n[123]Alice. \n[124]I'll give you a tour of the house.   \n[125]A private joke. We matriculate a lot.   \n[126]True, but the younger we start out in a new place, the longer we can stay there.   She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on.. .   \n[127]... and this is my room.   Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 8 track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up.   \n[128]No sleep.   \n[129]No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.   She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's, studying the titles.   \n[130]Do you have any favorites?   \n[131]Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.   \n[132]My favorite, too.   Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on. \n[133]Ever?   \n[134]I can always make you.   \n[135]You really shouldn't have said that.   He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat. She laughs and backs out the door, onto -   \n[136]Trust me?   \n[137]Then close your eyes.   She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to another tree like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the TOP of another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella.   \n[138]Open.   She does... to the most astonishing bird's eye VIEW of the valley, river, and the mountains beyond. CAMERA whirls around them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings. Off Bella's intoxicated face.. .   \n[139]Not that guy over -- yeah, he just looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.. .   89 \n[140]The window. As always.   \n[141]What else is there to do at night?    72. She pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her onto the bed, wrestling as -   \n[142]Shh! The Chief will hear you!   But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face.   \n[143]I just... like watching over you.   He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.   \n[144]There's something I'd like to try.   She nods, bedazzled by him. He takes her face in his hands, hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her.. .   What neither of them is prepared for is her response. Her breath comes in a wild GASP. Her fingers knot in his hair, clutching him to her. Lips part as she breathes his scent.. .   Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back. She opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched.   \n[145]I'm stronger than I thought.   \n[146]Don't be. But we have to be careful.  I can never lose control with you. Ever.   She nods, then carefully lies on his chest. He wraps his arms around her. Off the two of them.. .   \n[147]Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.   Edward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts a hello, resisting him.   \n[148]I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.   \n[149]Yes, sir, that's the plan.   \n[150]She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.     \n[151]Your father thinks you should go to an all-girl's school.   \n[152]It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why.   \n[153]Put your hair down -   \n[154]I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.   She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -  \n[155]James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off - -   -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around -   \n[156]-- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.    I just made this his most exciting game ever.   Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just wrought up on them all as.. .   \n[157]The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there.   \n[158]Then we'll lead the tracker away from him. Somehow.   He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING -   \n[159]Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please -   \n[160]I'll be in the truck.   And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into -   \n[161]He'll forgive you.  Slide over.. .   Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the door, sliding in, and takes the wheel. Bella slumps.   \n[162]It was the only way he'd let you go.   Edward FLOORS it.   \n[163]Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us -   Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the truck. Bella SCREAMS.   \n[164]It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.   She catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened. She looks out the window as they drive through town.. .   \n[165]But not impossible. We'll tear him up   \n[166]I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away -    84. \n[167]Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?   She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases, pulling out clothes, tossing them to -   \n[168]Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent.   \n[169]We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you.   He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes.   \n[170]You're my life now.    85. They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME -   \n[171]I'm coming to get you. (hates having to say   this We lost the tracker. The woman is still in the area. Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father.   \n[172]Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel.. .   \n[173]In a couple hours. Then you and \n[174]I'm strong enough to kill you.   Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through a freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he and Bella are JERKED downward.   James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks.   James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND -   Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony.   Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through the floorboards.   ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins.   BELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of focus.   Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when - -   Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle. Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like a baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror.   James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh .. .    95. WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder.   Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and ALICE, dropping down from the balcony.   Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far. He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and LUNGE at James like a pack of animals.   Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in pain. Edward dashes toward her - -   BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire.. .   BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain.   \n[175]Venom - -   \n[176]No!   BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.   \n[177]It doesn't have to be that way.   \n[178]What's the other choice? You said -   \n[179]Carlisle.   \n[180]I -- won't be able to stop -   \n[181]It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away.   He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her hand. They never take their eyes off one another, the connection palpable, intense.. .   CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain. But subsiding.. .   CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun. He sucks harder. Hungrily. Anguished, he wants to stop but can't. Dr. Cullen's voice sounds miles away.. .   \n[182]We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.   She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him.   \n[183]You're in here because of me.   Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face.   \n[184]The worst of it... was thinking \n[185]Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore.. .   \n[186]Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here.. .   He wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms.. .   \n[187]You're perfect... I'll take good   care of her, Chief.   \n[188]Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss anything.   She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately. They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees -   THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Emmett, looking absolutely stunning.   Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we hear a crossfade into the next track-   \n[189]Shall we?   \n[190]See? You're dancing.   \n[191]You don't know what you're saying. You don't want this.   \n[192]I won't end your life for you.   He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.   \n[193]That's how it's supposed to happen.  \n[194]Her visions change, Bella.  \n[195]Is that what you dream about? Becoming a monster?   \n[196]You really want this?   \n[197]You're ready right now?   \n[198]You're going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn't that enough?   She looks at him... and finally smiles.   ", "CHARLIE": "\n[1]Your hair's longer.   \n[2]Guess it grew out again.   She just nods. Silence.   \n[3]How's your mom?   \n[4]I put Grandpa's old desk in your   room. And I cleared some shelves   in the bathroom.   \n[5]I'll just put these up in your room -   \n[6]Bella, you remember Billy Black.   \n[7]Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill.   \n[8]So what do you think of your homecoming gift?   \n[9]Just bought it off Billy, here.   \n[10]Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.   \n[11]You always do.   \n[12]Easier than washing dishes.   \n[13]I remember.. .   They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner.   \n[14]How was school? Meet anyone?    16. \n[15]Are people talking about them again?   \n[16]Just \u0091cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here.   \n[17]I just don't like narrow mindedness.   And he returns to his food. Silence.   \n[18]You okay, Bells? \n[19]That's why I got you new tires. She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires. \n[20]The other ones were nearly bald.    19. \n[21]I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading down to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal.. .   UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks.. .   \n[22]You're not in Phoenix any more, honey. They've been hunting it for a week with no luck. Thought I'd lend a hand.   \n[23]Always am.   \n[24]Bells. Are you alright?   \n[25]It sure as hell is not okay.   \n[26]We nearly lost you.   \n[27]You can kiss your license goodbye.   \n[28]Good. Dr. Cullen.   \n[29]Edward? Your boy?   Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses.   \n[30]I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom.   \n[31]Your mother called. Again.   \n[32]She always did know how to worry.    But... she's changed, too. She seems happy. Phil sounds all right.   \n[33]Known him going on thirty years.   He's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do. And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat.. .   Then Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, then projects a confident manner.   \n[34]We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime.. .   As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY.   \n[35]... I want you to have this.   \n[36]It'll give me some peace of mind.   She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her purse.   As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE -   \n[37]Pale Ale.   \n[38]Found a footprint out at the crime scene today. A bare, human footprint.   Billy seems disturbed but not surprised. Bella is horrified.   \n[39]Spread the word out at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids out of the woods.   \n[40]Guys, we got something -   The Deputies hurry to Charlie. They gather around - A FOOTPRINT. The dogs start pulling them in a certain direction. As the posse takes off at a sprint -   \n[41]Ordered you the seafood combo.   \n[42]I'm healthy as a horse.   \n[43]The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on.   \n[44]Your friends are flagging you.    70. She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles.   \n[45]It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.   \n[46]It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons.   \n[47]None of the boys in town interest you?   \n[48]Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much.   \n[49]He's too old for you.   \n[50]And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.   \n[51]Now? He's out there?   \n[52]Good.   He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.   \n[53]Bella's going to play baseball?   Bella's equally surprised, but hides it.    74. \n[54]Well. More power to you, I guess.   \n[55]You got that pepper spray?   \n[56]Bella? What happened?   \n[57]Bells. Did he hurt you?   \n[58]Then what? Did he break up with you?   \n[59]I thought you liked him?   \n[60]Your mother's not even in Phoenix.   \n[61]You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning.   \n[62]Bells, I know I'm not around much,   but I can change that. We can do   more things together.   She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say.. .   \n[63]Bella... I just got you back.   Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to deliver the final blow.   \n[64]Heard that before.   Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back.   \n[65]I put new pepper spray in your bag.   \n[66]... and... you look beautiful.   Father and daughter share a smile.. .   ", "JESSICA": "\n[1]Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack!   Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court -   -- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair.   \n[2]She's got a great spike, doesn't she?    So, you're from Arizona, right? Aren't people supposed to be tan down there?   \n[3]It's first grade all over again, and you're the shiny new toy.   Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, low key, insecure friend.   \n[4]Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.   \n[5]Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.. .   ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight lifter, but a playful glint in his eye.   \n[6]... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.    11. \n[7]But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird.. .   ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.   \n[8]... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. \n[9]That's Edward Cullen.   Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems.. . confused. Bella quickly looks away.   \n[10]He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care.    Anyway, don't waste your time.   \n[11]Guess who just asked me to prom!   Bella smiles.   \n[12]I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird?   \n[13]I know, right?   Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads out the door that leads to -   \n[14]Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board.   \n[15]Keep her company. Her date bailed.   \n[16]She invited Edward.   \n[17]Whenever the weather's nice, the   Cullens disappear.   \n[18]No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank \u0091em   out for hiking and camping and   stuff. I tried the idea out on my   parents. Not even close.   Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.    40. \n[19]Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out.   \n[20]I think this halter makes my boobs look big. What do you think, Bella?   Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward a bar. Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress. Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella.   \n[21]Bella?   \n[22]You said that about the last five dresses.   \n[23]She was right about this halter,   though. It does look great.   \n[24]We waited, but we were starving -   Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be charming. And they are charmed.   \n[25]I - we - understand. We were just... leaving, so -   The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them.   \n[26]Really thoughtful.   \n[27]Monte Carlo? That's our prom   theme?   ", "JAMES": "\n[1]Always the same inane questions.. .   Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA, 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.   \n[2]\u0093What do you want? \u0094    39. \n[3]The question should be, \u0093will it hurt? \u0094   Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE -   \n[4]By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg.   Victoria lasciviously grabs James' shirt. Pulls him to her. \n[5]You brought a snack.   EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back.   OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James.   \n[6]I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well.   Bella's eyes are wild with fear.   \n[7]I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.   \n[8]You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that?   \n[9]If your mother's life depends on it?   Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here.   \n[10]The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.    She smells like you. Delicious.   STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. Useless. Then she remembers.. .   Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection now.   \n[11]That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you?   Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief.   \n[12]Sorry. But you really made it too easy.   Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella.   \n[13]So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind.    And... action!   Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.   \n[14]Excellent! An escape attempt.   Suddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes.   \n[15]It'll break Edward's little heart.   He smells her hair. Touches her throat.   \n[16]He will. His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.   He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in her hand. She spins around and sprays him.   Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly. But he leaps over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.   Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it on film.   \n[17]Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.   He advances toward her.   \n[18]Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it.   He inhales as if he can taste her already -   \n[19]Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really.   James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper spray. He tries to wipe it off.   \n[20]Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me.   He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in agony.   \n[21]Tell Edward how much it hurts.   Abruptly, the camera is in her face -   \n[22]Tell him to avenge you.   \n[23]Cut! The end.   Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME!   He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column.   \n[24]You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger.   James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.   ", "RENE": "\n[1]It won't work again, baby.   \n[2]I did?   \n[3]I'll figure it out. You gotta be able to reach me and Phil on the road - \n[4]Now, you know if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is.   But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.   \n[5]You might. You've always hated Forks.   \n[6]Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now.    17. Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone quarters.   \n[7]Now, tell me more about your   school, baby. What are the kids   like? Are there any cute guys?   Are they being nice to you?   \n[8]Phil's working hard. We're looking around for a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent. You'd like Jacksonville, baby.   \n[9]Could... a guy have something to do with that?   \n[10]Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet he's smart. Is he smart?   \n[11]No way, we gotta talk boys. Are you being safe?   Edward shoots her a look, he heard that. She's mortified.   \n[12]But you're a wonderful dancer.   \n[13]He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward \u0093sleeps. \u0094   \n[14]He never leaves. And your dad's down in the cafeteria.   \n[15]Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.   Bella is drawing a blank, confused. Rene jogs her memory - \n[16]Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs. A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods. \n[17]It's Phil. He's worried about you.   \n[18]I told him to stay in Florida. The Suns signed him!   \n[19]Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom.. .   \n[20]And he's there.   Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.   \n[21]Charlie doesn't like him. Blames him for your leaving.   \n[22]I think that boy is in love with you.   Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward.   \n[23]I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But I\u0091ll go get him.    99. Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go. The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes well. He kisses her forehead soothingly.   ", "ANGELA": "\n[1]Sorry, needed a candid for the feature -   \n[2]Guess we'll just run another editorial on teen drinking.   \n[3]-- Wait, that's a good one.. .   But Bella's attention is now riveted to -   \n[4]The Cullens.   Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode.   \n[5]They kinda keep to themselves.   \n[6]Jess, they're not actually related.   \n[7]Maybe he'll adopt me.   Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter -   EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him.   \n[8]There's whale watching, too. Come with.   \n[9]I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just... doesn't.   \n[10]I am?   \n[11]I think it's nice she invited him. No one ever does.   \n[12]I'm going to the prom with Eric! \n[13]Thank God. We need your opinion.   Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind.. .   \n[14]You're not very good at this, are you?    41. \n[15]You sure?   Bella nods, heads out. Jessica's looks in the mirror again.   \n[16]Where were you!? We left you a message.   \n[17]That's so... thoughtful.   \n[18]Oh. My. God. Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen. Jessica and Eric ", "JACOB": "\n[1]I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids.   \n[2]It's getting worse with old age.   Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella -   \n[3]I rebuilt the engine and - -   \n[4]Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but - -   He hands her the keys as she climbs in.   \n[5]I go to school on the reservation.   \n[6]You're on my rez, remember? You surfing?   \n[7]Oops. Caught that, huh?   He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy.   \n[8]I'm not supposed to say anything.   Bella gives him her best alluring smile.   \n[9]It's just an old scary story. Did you know the Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves?   \n[10]Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like.. .     \u0093enemy clan.\u0094 ... But they claimed to be different, so we made a treaty with them.   \n[11]Or just moved back.   \n[12]If they promised to stay off Quileute lands, we wouldn't expose what they really were to the pale-faces.. .   Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers.   \n[13]It's just a story, Bella.   Off Bella, with more unanswered questions.. .    38. \n[14]Looks good. You got that dent out.   \n[15]Great, Dad. Thanks.   Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE CRUISER pulls up.

He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead.   \n[6]I'll see you soon.   Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden China, Asian scrolls. They reach -   THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer.   \n[7]It's time.   -- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.   \n[8]Stop! I didn't see them.. .   They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side.
