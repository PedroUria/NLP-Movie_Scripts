I'm sorry. I had to run an errand. \n[82]I know. \n[83]Was it a good service? \n[84]I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. \n[85]Hey Doc. \n[86]She's good. \n[87]I don't have a cold. \n[88]No, I just told her that. \n[89]I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. \n[90]`Bout four nights now. \n[91]Well some, but real restless. \n[92]Well, I think... \n[93]I think I may need to try some medication. \n[94]The reason I've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams I've been havin'. I didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day I woke up and the bed was wet. \n[95]Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. \n[96]It's been about a month. \n[97]Okay. \n[98]All right. \n[99]Hey Dewart! \n[100]Not much. \n[101]Yeah, we'll get it done.

I did. \n[113]You want me to come there and do it for you? Jesus. \n[114]Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week? \n[115]I mean to stay alive. What do you think you'd need? \n[116]You think? \n[117]I've never heard of that. \n[118]It's on there. It's on. Come on. 43. \n[119]Dammit. \n[120]It sounds like thunder. \n[121]Hey Mom. \n[122]Sure. \n[123]I'm going to get some water. \n[124]You want some? \n[125]Mom? 46. \n[126]I need to ask you somethin'. \n[127]Do you remember what year we brought you up here? To the first place. \n[128]It was `86. \n[129]I was 10. \n[130]Can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed? \n[131]I mean...I just want to know how it all started. Before you had to leave. \n[132]Did you ever have any dreams? Like bad dreams. \n[133]It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. \n[134]Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. \n[135]May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan? Thanks. \n[136]Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche. Hey Doc. Yeah, sorry...Sorry to call you at home, I just don't think I can make it to Columbus to see that psychiatrist. Yeah, it's just too far. Is there somewhere local you can send me? 48. \n[137]Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up. \n[138]I went to see mom. \n[139]Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her. \n[140]That's okay. \n[141]I will in a bit. \n[142]We've been good about that. \n[143]That's fine. \n[144]I need the money John. \n[145]Hey. \n[146]Sorry I left you yesterday. 51. \n[147]Thanks. \n[148]Sure. \n[149]You need another burner? \n[150]You think you could help me with somethin'? \n[151]I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard. I could use some help. \n[152]Just needs to be done. \n[153]I figure I'll do it on Saturday, borrow some equipment from work. \n[154]I just need a backhoe, a hauler. I'll rent the rest. \n[155]Thanks. \n[156]What do you mean? \n[157]I'm not. \n[158]Hello. \n[159]Curtis. \n[160]Okay. I already answered all the questions on the forms. \n[161]Right. Well... \n[162]Out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed with \n[163]delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the negative symptoms, I've had two. Delusions and hallucinations. But they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere near that long. So, I took this quiz in the back of the book and I scored a five out of a possible twenty. Schizophrenia starts at twelve. So, they say it might be a...  brief psychotic disorder. Whatever it is, I need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control. \n[164]Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms. I was just 10. My brother was 17. And, uh...I don't know. She just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day. And she didn't come back. And then they found her a week later eatin' trash out of a dumpster in northern Kentucky. 55. \n[165]My dad had to put her in the state hospital in Columbus. And she's been in assisted living ever since. Yep. My dad raised me. He died last April. \n[166]Is anyone seeing this? \n[167]Hey. It's all right. Calm down. \n[168]Samantha. \n[169]I didn't want you worryin' about it. \n[170]I got a home improvement loan from the bank. \n[171]I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us. I know you don't understand. \n[172]There's nothin' to explain. \n[173]I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed. \n[174]No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. \n[175]I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out. \n[176]Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday. \n[177]Thanks. \n[178]I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry. \n[179]I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. \n[180]They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm. 62. \n[181]And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm. \n[182]Yeah. \n[183]It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. \n[184]It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. \n[185]I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. \n[186]You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. 63. \n[187]Six weeks? \n[188]Yeah. 64. \n[189]Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. \n[190]I need a favor Jim. \n[191]Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. \n[192]No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. \n[193]Yes sir. I appreciate that but... well it would just be very helpful in this case. \n[194]No. Whoever you think's right. \n[195]Thank you. \n[196]I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind. \n[197]Yessir. \n[198]Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks? \n[199]The newest one. 67. \n[200]How much? \n[201]Anything cheaper? \n[202]You got any kids sizes? \n[203]Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em. \n[204]Just addin' on to the storm shelter. \n[205]Just `cause. \n[206]Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin' sewer out to the city line. \n[207]It's not bad. \n[208]Yeah. 69. \n[209]I'm not. \n[210]I figured. \n[211]Called you to come tell me to quit? \n[212]So what? \n[213]No. No more than anybody else. \n[214]Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it. \n[215]Well I appreciate it Kyle. \n[216]Yeah. A few days ago. \n[217]You should see her. Take your girls. \n[218]No. I've got it. \n[219]I will. \n[220]Hey Kyle? \n[221]Actually you could do me a favor. \n[222]You still looking for a dog? \n[223]They got a good spot for you, okay bud. \n[224]Yeah. \n[225]Hey Kyle? \n[226]Take care of yourself. \n[227]All right. Bedtime. \n[228]Ah shit. \n[229]Hey Jim. \n[230]Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours. \n[231]Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right. \n[232]Did you fire Dewart? \n[233]I've been fired. \n[234]We get two more weeks. \n[235]I'm sorry... 75. \n[236]Oh, `scuse me. \n[237]Yeah. \n[238]What happened to Kendra? \n[239]Huh. \n[240]That's the alternator from the truck. 78. \n[241]I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. \n[242]You gonna leave me? \n[243]I'm sorry. \n[244]Yeah. \n[245]Yeah. \n[246]Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it. 79. \n[247]I don't want to see any of those people. \n[248]All right. \n[249]How many pieces does Hannah get? \n[250]Not here man. \n[251]I know. \n[252]I know. I'm sorry. \n[253]Come on. \n[254]God dammit. 81. \n[255]\n[256]You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that what he told you! \n[257]Well, listen up! There is a storm comin' like nothing you have ever seen. And not a one of you is prepared for it. You think I'm crazy? I'M TALKIN' \n[258]Sleep well in your beds. Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more. 82. \n[259]Hannah? \n[260]Hannah! \n[261]Come on. It's okay. \n[262]It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit down. \n[263]It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. \n[264]Please just do it. Okay? \n[265]There we go. All right. Keep it out of your eyes. Okay? \n[266]Hey. I love you. It's okay. 85. \n[267]Where's your mask? \n[268]No. \n[269]What if it's...What if it's not over? \n[270]What if it's not over? \n[271]It's still storming. \n[272]I can hear it. \n[273]Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. \n[274]Thunder? Do you feel it? 87. \n[275]You feel it? You feel it? \n[276]I'm sorry. \n[277]I'm sorry. \n[278]I'm sorry. I can't. \n[279]Could you move Hannah back? 88. \n[280]It's fine. \n[281]I don't have a job right now. \n[282]You mean I have to leave my family. \n[283]Hey. Good, huh? \n[284]Good. We put a top on it. \n[285]What is it honey? \n[286]What? \n[287]Sam. ", "SAMANTHA": "\n[1]You slept late. \n[2]I've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are coming over. \n[3]Yeah. Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house. \n[4]Cam can hold her own. We need to send in the deposit for the beach condo. 3. \n[5]Okay. Bye. \n[6]No more food.

Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. She fished out a board that had nails on it. \n[19]I still whisper. \n[20]Curtis? \n[21]Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. \n[22]What's wrong? \n[23]She's fine down there.

I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. \n[40]If you're sick, we should cancel. \n[41]Okay, we'll talk later. \n[42]Come on. Let's go. You sure? \n[43]Okay. \n[44]This pillow's fifteen dollars. \n[45]This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that. \n[46]I can't go that low. \n[47]How about 10? \n[48]That's fine. \n[49]Lucky for you she likes to count change. \n[50]But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? \n[51]What? \n[52]You hear me? I said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside? \n[53]He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog. \n[54]Hannah loves Red. \n[55]It's awful. \n[56]Yeah? \n[57]You're still not feeling good? \n[58]Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed today. 29. \n[59]Honey if you're not feeling good we take you in somewhere. \n[60]Okay. Do you want me to cancel lunch today... \n[61]What is that? \n[62]I was gonna leave Hannah with you so I could go to church, but I'm not going to with you like this. \n[63]No. She needs breakfast. \n[64]I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude. \n[65]What's wrong with you? \n[66]Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her. \n[67]Let's just start. \n[68]Where the hell have you been? \n[69]You're really late. \n[70]You didn't even bring your cell phone. \n[71]Dad. \n[72]Can I give you a hug? 39. \n[73]I love you. \n[74]I have good news. 40. \n[75]Green? How `bout a red? \n[76]It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks. \n[77]Like this. \n[78]Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. \n[79]Eight ninety nine a week. \n[80]You sleep well? \n[81]You look like you're feeling better. \n[82]Hey. \n[83]It's okay.

You didn't say one word about this to me. Don't you think you owe me that? Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what I had to say? \n[92]Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that? \n[93]How could you do that without talking to me? You know the expenses we have comin' up. You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter? \n[94]You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. I don't understand you puttin' Red out back. I don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time. You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. Explain that to me. Please. Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this. 59. \n[95]Curtis! \n[96]Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my God. Baby. \n[97]I need an ambulance! My husband's having a seizure. 41800 Tindale Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding! 60. \n[98]Okay. Okay. \n[99]Honey? \n[100]Honey? Are you okay? \n[101]You were having a seizure. I called an ambulance. \n[102]What are you doing? \n[103]Baby what's goin' on? 61. \n[104]What's goin' on? \n[105]That's why you put him out back? \n[106]What was the dream? Tonight. \n[107]It's wonderful. \n[108]I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side? 66. \n[109]I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or salad. \n[110]Things are fine. We're fine. \n[111]You okay? \n[112]Who's that? \n[113]What about the health insurance? \n[114]I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. \n[115]Here. I hope you like them. \n[116]That's terrific. It's fine. 77. \n[117]Call me if they don't work and I'm sorry again. \n[118]What's that? \n[119]You flinched when I touched your hand this morning. \n[120]I was in one of your dreams? \n[121]Can you deal with that? \n[122]Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good. \n[123]We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me. \n[124]I want you to go.

Please open the door. \n[141]I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us.

You hear about people livin' for days all the time offa bark and melted snow. \n[22]Shit I don't know. You asked the question. \n[23]What? \n[24]What sounds like thunder? \n[25]Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you goin'? \n[26]Hey. \n[27]Jim came by. I covered for you. \n[28]I need your help with the depth charts. \n[29]Fuckin' Nat put me in charge of frying oysters for that Lions Club supper. \n[30]Yeah, if you still got yours I could use it. \n[31]Whatta you need? \n[32]The hell you wanna do that for? \n[33]What do you need? 52. \n[34]You sure about that? \n[35]Yeah. Whatever. I'll help. \n[36]You all right man? \n[37]I just don't wanna see you fuck up. \n[38]What're you doin' here? \n[39]I said what are you doin' here. \n[40]I told people what you been doin'. \n[41]You cut me loose. Everything we been through. \n[42]You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry you wouldn't cut me loose. We fuckin' friends! This how you treat friends? ", "KYLE": "\n[1]What the hell are you doin'? \n[2]What you got goin' on here? \n[3]Why? \n[4]You runnin' water to it? \n[5]How much you spendin' on this thing? \n[6]Doesn't look it. \n[7]You take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and you're screwed. You got the cash for this? \n[8]Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up. \n[9]Samantha called me. \n[10]She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. \n[11]So? \n[12]You stressed out? \n[13]Work all right? \n[14]You can stop that shit right now. I'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped. 70. \n[15]I'm just coming here to check on you. \n[16]You been to see Mom? \n[17]She all right. \n[18]Yeah. I'll get around to it. \n[19]You need a hand? \n[20]Okay. Call me if you need me okay? \n[21]What's that? 71. \n[22]Sure. \n[23]You sure? \n[24]I know it'll make my girls happy. All right. \n[25]Yeah? \n[26]All right. All right. I will little brother. You take care of your family. Handle your business. Okay? 72. \n[27]All right. ", "JIM": "\n[1]I didn't say you had control over the weather Russell, what I did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. That's non- negotiable. \n[2]Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that east 82nd site? \n[3]It rained for two hours yesterday. Two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet. We lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day. \n[4]End of day Curtis. \n[5]All right. Valerie tells me that the father son pancake cook off... 13. \n[6]Come in. \n[7]What you need Curtis? \n[8]What's that? \n[9]What's the trouble? He not pullin' his weight? \n[10]You know, I understand. This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis. You're gonna have to learn that. 65. \n[11]Okay. Well, I can put him with Russell. Anybody else you prefer? \n[12]Okay. \n[13]You been missin' a lotta work Curtis. \n[14]No. But don't. Okay. \n[15]Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself. \n[16]You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke. 74. \n[17]What if you had an accident? Huh? What if you ran somebody over on your way out here? Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me. \n[18]You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks benefits. \n[19]He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to yourself. ", "DOCTOR SHANNAN": "\n[1]Curtis, how you doin' bud? \n[2]How's my girl? 35. \n[3]That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. \n[4]Oh. Did she get that down wrong? \n[5]Oh. So what's the problem? \n[6]How long's this been goin' on? \n[7]You're not sleepin' at all? \n[8]Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise. 36. \n[9]Why do you say that? \n[10]You urinated in your bed? \n[11]You been to see your mother lately? \n[12]Okay. This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. It's non- habit forming, but I'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime,  This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist. It's a drive, but he's the best I know. 37. \n[13]I'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him. ", "SARAH": "\n[1]Curtis. \n[2]Come in. \n[3]No. \n[4]Isn't she lovely. \n[5]Yes. \n[6]Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a senior. \n[7]Yes. \n[8]What do you mean? \n[9]Oh, I don't know. I remember it was a real stressful time. Your father was gone a lot, and I couldn't handle things on my own. \n[10]No. Nothing like that. There was always... 47. \n[11]There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me. \n[12]Are you okay? ", "KENDRA": "\n[1]Come in. \n[2]Hi. \n[3]Have a seat. I'm Kendra. \n[4]I'm gonna start by askin' you some questions. \n[5]Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but I need to get a profile started on you. \n[6]Look. I'm a counselor. Certified, but I'm not a psychiatrist. I can't prescribe anything to you. I can talk to you, I can recommend where to send you, but that's it. \n[7]Now that said, if you want to talk, I'll listen. For a lot of people that's a good start. \n[8]Now you said here that your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties. And you're at 35. You wanna talk about that? \n[9]So tell me `bout these dreams. ", "NAT": "\n[1]They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god...it was like I was bein' in a museum and I saw the progress from apes to men. I saw it. I saw the future. Dewart, that was him...that was going to be him in 20 years. \n[2]Let me tell you, you laugh. You laugh. But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. Yep... Hannah! 5. \n[3]I'll call next week about the Lions Club supper. \n[4]What like slaw? \n[5]Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. \n[6]It's not like you don't have enough on your plate with Hannah. ", "PSYCHIATRIST": "\n[1]Do you have any vacation time that you could use? \n[2]Well, I know that times are hard, but I think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter. 89. \n[3]I think you need to break away from it for awhile. We can start you on some medication that I think will help, but that action alone would mean a lot. \n[4]I think that would be okay if we start the medication now. It would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but I want to be clear, when Curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that. \n[5]I mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility. \n[6]I think you need to seriously commit to some treatment.
