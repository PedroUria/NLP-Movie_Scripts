Lucky me. \n[3]You don't need to be scared. \n[4]Cancer? \n[5]I'm a regular hero. \n[6]No one lives forever. \n[7]What can I say. I was seventeen, I was angry, I was stupid. \n[8]Hallelujah. \n[9]Hey!   Yo, over here! \n[10]Damn it's good to see you guys, I felt like I was the last man on... \n[11]Oh God... \n[12]You're human... you can see me, you can touch me. This place is real. \n[13]I thought I was in hell. \n[14]Those things with masks, red eyes-- \n[15]If I'm not in hell, where am I?! \n[16]First put down the shotgun. \n[17]I don't wanna kill anyone. \n[18]I don't like it when people point guns at me. \n[19]You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? Pretty stupid. \n[20]In the city. \n[21]Seemed kinda dead to me. \n[22]That wasn't a helicopter... \n[23]Marcus. Marcus Wright. \n[24]What year is it? \n[25]Fifteen years... I've lost 15 years. So who did it to us? Terrorists? The Russians, the Chinese--? \n[26]The nukes. There was a war, right? Who started it? \n[27]Dying. \n[28]That flying grapefruit, what was it? \n[29]Jalape\u00f1o sauce. \n[30]No thanks.     Not hungry. \n[31]I look the same. \n[32]Oh yeah.

Your life? \n[36]You don't know me. \n[37]Skynet runs the machines...?   So who's this John Connor? \n[38]Yeah, right. Him and Jesus. \n[39]You're asking the wrong guy. \n[40]I killed a cop. \n[41]Well... Nah, some of `em were all right. My little brother Max, pretty wild kid, not much older than you-- he stole a car, just joy-riding, y'know, showing off. \n[42]Cop chased him right into our front yard, pulled him outta the car... and started whaling on him, kicking the shit out of him. No reason for it, Max was already in cuffs. I ran out of the house, guy tried to pull his gun on me-- guess I just went off on him. Don't even remember it really... they say I broke his neck. Max must be dead too, now... like everybody else. \n[43]Sure. \n[44]The bible. My grandma always tried to get me into it, but-- it always put me to sleep. Still does. \n[45]\"...of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son Jephunneh--\" \n[46]\"Guaranteed lowest prices... open seven days...\" \n[47]It's a flower. A rose. \n[48]Guess people had it pretty good.

I got all my sisters with me...\" No, huh. How about... \"Twinkle twinkle little star...\" \"How I wonder what you are... up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky...\" \n[51]You OK? \n[52]It's called driving.   Sure. \n[53]Not too many around in my time. \n[54]Pop the clutch! Let your foot up! \n[55]Sort of. \n[56]No!    You're doing fine. \n[57]Ssh. \n[58]Stop the car. \n[59]Other pedal, other pedal! \n[60]Damn it.    Empty. \n[61]What is this? \n[62]Spit it out! \n[63]Oops. \n[64]Name's Marcus. \n[65]I'm heading that way. \n[66]I've got to get to my friends-- \n[67]Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster-- \n[68]Hydrobots? \n[69]You're with the Resistance. \n[70]I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die... \n[71]Let's hear it. \n[72]What the hell for? \n[73]I've never seen trees like these. \n[74]Freaky. \n[75]What was that? \n[76]They're surrounding us. \n[77]Dog eat dog world. \n[78]Staf?   What's that mean? \n[79]I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice... \n[80]I dunno. They just... sorta reminded me of her. \n[81]There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me. \n[82]We're in somebody's garden. \n[83]Over there. \n[84]Boo! \n[85]Get me the hell down from here! \n[86]Why are you doing this?    What is this place? \n[87]Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was. \n[88]What are you talking about? \n[89]I'm a man! \n[90]Even if I never been treated like one. \n[91]Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. Do it! \n[92]So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? \n[93]Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him? \n[94]This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me? \n[95]So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go. \n[96]What? \n[97]You're out of your mind, aren't you? \n[98]Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me? \n[99]Hello? Anyone there? I'm thirsty. \n[100]I need water. \n[101]Please, I'm-- \n[102]Why are you doing this? \n[103]So what am I...? \n[104]You think they'll buy that? \n[105]I'm heading across the river. \n[106]I'm not human, remember? \n[107]It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense... \n[108]For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead. \n[109]Where's that go? \n[110]Thank you. \n[111]Don't mention it. \n[112]What the hell is this? \n[113]Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings-- \n[114]Marcus. \n[115]I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere. \n[116]This isn't food. \n[117]Terminators! \n[118]What are you? \n[119]A hybrid-- human and machine? \n[120]Jesus... why? \n[121]What about the ones who weren't? \n[122]Your family. You lost them? \n[123]Why are you smiling? \n[124]Tell me everything.   How did you people get here? \n[125]Angel-- what is it? \n[126]English! \n[127]It's a graveyard. \n[128]Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! \n[129]You all work for Skynet! \n[130]The end of the world. \n[131]Into-- this? A brain in a box? \n[132]Destroying the human race in order to save it. \n[133]What are you doing? \n[134]No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you! \n[135]I'm not sure I know how to describe it. \n[136]When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring. \n[137]A time machine... Connor was right. \n[138]...I've just heard him speak. \n[139]In the world outside-- the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this? \n[140]Then why... Some people I knew were picked up, taken here... \n[141]Yes... what is this place? \n[142]That's them. \n[143]Of course.     I... I understand. \n[144]What is it? \n[145]I need to go back! \n[146]What do I do? \n[147]Let them go. \n[148]I said, let them go! \n[149]Now you're pissing me off. \n[150]How'd that feel? \n[151]I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain! \n[152]Last chance. Let them out. \n[153]I'm gonna need your clothes. \n[154]We've gotta get out of here. \n[155]Stay down! \n[156]It's OK, I'm not human! \n[157]You can't drive! \n[158]I know.   Long story. \n[159]Take that path! \n[160]The trees! \n[161]You two all right? \n[162]There. \n[163]I'm sorry. \n[164]There are more prisoners, a complex about a mile in-- \n[165]Yeah, well. Get in line. \n[166]I don't feel a thing.    Help somebody else. \n[167]They're not people anymore... \n[168]No! \n[169]No one lives forever. \n[170]I have no idea. I should be dead... \n[171]So to speak. \n[172]Yeah, simpler to keep it man versus machine. \n[173]Better than anything. Everything made sense. For the first time in my life, I felt... right. It was heaven. \n[174]I never really believed in heaven. \n[175]You're asking me to become... Him? \n[176]Why me? \n[177]Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... ", "BLAIR": "\n[1]Yo!   Up here! \n[2]Who are you-- \n[3]You can put me down now, Marcus. \n[4]I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move. \n[5]The hot zone? No you're not. \n[6]What friends? \n[7]The Skynet transport? It was carrying people? Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but... \n[8]You can't get across-- river's fulla hydrobots-- \n[9]They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there. \n[10]Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard. \n[11]Stupid bastards. Come on. \n[12]That snap you out of it? \n[13]Well hell, maybe you are dreaming. Do us all a favor and wake up already. \n[14]So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm... \n[15]and the next thing you know, you're here. Since this ain't the resurrection, there's only one possibility. \n[16]Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for-- there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass. \n[17]Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends-- why let a body like yours go to waste? \n[18]We're in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed squirrel here once-- \n[19]Tasted like chicken. \n[20]Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here. \n[21]I didn't hear anything-- \n[22]Skindogs. \n[23]They're smart. And they don't scare easy. \n[24]You saved my ass. Thanks. \n[25]Thanks. \n[26]It's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. Might as well STAF till morning. \n[27]C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite. \n[28]It's a resistance term.    Sit tight and fuck. \n[29]You holding out for lipstick? Lingerie? Or am I not your... type? \n[30]Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out. \n[31]What are these? \n[32]Who? \n[33]I can't compete with that. \n[34]Christ... there's supposed to be barbed wire along the edge. \n[35]Whatever you do, don't move. Yo! Morrison, Barnes! Can anybody hear me?! We're in the middle of the mine field. \n[36]Eat shit and die, Barnes! \n[37]Could you get us outta here please? \n[38]You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries? \n[39]You goddamn idiot! \n[40]What are you doing? \n[41]I don't think so. \n[42]Whatever he is-- he's on our side-- \n[43]He saved my life! \n[44]What do you want from me-- I didn't know! \n[45]Leave him alone! Marcus, I'm so sorry... \n[46]How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack. \n[47]We got a stash back at the base. \n[48]You need something to wash it down. \n[49]You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I just didn't want to join the harem. \n[50]Noble of you to make the sacrifice. \n[51]I prefer a little privacy. \n[52]Men.   You're all talk. \n[53]I used up the last of my Valium for you... Hold out your arms. \n[54]I don't believe you're a terminator. \n[55]Whatever you are-- I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes-- they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out-- \n[56]Worth a shot. Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live. \n[57]They're already here for you-- \n[58]Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country-- \n[59]No human being can survive there-- \n[60]You're gonna try and save those kids. \n[61]Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already-- \n[62]Damn it, we're too late-- \n[63]Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan-- \n[64]Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance. \n[65]Sir. \n[66]Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's human. \n[67]He's trying to find his friends. \n[68]A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle. \n[69]Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.' \n[70]That's it.     How did you...? \n[71]Marcus... I need to head back to my unit. \n[72]What about you? \n[73]We've been ordered not to talk about it-- the hybrids, everything about that place is top secret... \n[74]How could you give that up? \n[75]Here.   You need these more than I do. ", "KYLE": "\n[1]What's your name? \n[2]Kyle Reese. She doesn't remember her name-- --so I call her Star. \n[3]Gonna be light soon, Marcus, better find cover. We spotted some buildings half a mile that way. \n[4]You can come if you want. \n[5]I like him. He's funny. \n[6]Nope.   Eighteen. \n[7]Yup.   Two thousand eighteen. \n[8]Something fall on your head? The machines did it, the computers-- they got smart. \n[9]What's the last thing you remember? \n[10]Eyeball.   Only one. \n[11]Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors. \n[12]Any red ones? \n[13]Mm.    Ketchup. \n[14]So can I. Well, sort of... a little. \n[15]Never heard anyone say that before. \n[16]You ever watch television? \n[17]I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great. \n[18]Dunno. Been together since we was little. Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell... she and me are the only ones still around. \n[19]We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you're pretty cool. \n[20]You're strong, you can read... you didn't kill us. Good enough for me... \n[21]He's... I don't know. The best. Everybody talks about him. He's the one who's gonna save us. \n[22]Who's Jesus? \n[23]So why were you in prison? \n[24]Were cops like terminators? \n[25]You gonna be here when I wake up? \n[26]Good.   Stay away from the windows. \n[27]If we get it to move, will you teach me to make it go? \n[28]Aerostat's coming! \n[29]Wow.   You're good. \n[30]That's him! \n[31]We oughta find a place to hole up for the day... \n[32]You smell that? \n[33]Who cares? \n[34]We've landed. \n[35]I don't know... \n[36]We're stopping. \n[37]Whatever happens, we stick together. \n[38]Shh, keep singing. \n[39]Stop it stop it STOP IT! \n[40]No! \n[41]Marcus! \n[42]Watch me! \n[43]Come on I was doing good! \n[44]Where are we going? \n[45]He's not real. \n[46]Kyle Reese. \n[47]I don't remember my mother. ", "SERENA": "\n[1]Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science... \n[2]You've been chosen for our research. \n[3]We just need a couple of signatures... \n[4]I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration. \n[5]You're not the only one with a death sentence. \n[6]What you're doing is important, Marcus. Our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine. \n[7]Thank you.     And... I'm sorry. \n[8]Why isn't he conscious? Something's wrong, he should be coming out of it by now... \n[9]Marcus! \n[10]Marcus... it is you. You're alive, you found us. Welcome to paradise. \n[11]There was no choice-- the old civilization had to be eliminated. To make way for a new world... a world without death or suffering. \n[12]You were the first... I'm sorry. \n[13]We should never have left you behind. \n[14]Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right. \n[15]Repairing you. \n[16]Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program-- a tool, a means to an end. \n[17]Its sole purpose is to protect humanity. \n[18]Listen to me. Skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions. As soon as it came on line, it factored in war, disease, environmental destruction-- and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years. The human race was doomed... unless we were transformed. \n[19]Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation. \n[20]When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma... \n[21]Your interface was never installed. \n[22]We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand. \n[23]How are you feeling, Marcus? \n[24]It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel... a part of something. \n[25]Pure ecstasy... we can share in it together. \n[26]Were you bored just now? \n[27]That sensation is always there for you, whenever you desire. But most of us here are scientists... our greatest joy is using our minds to explore, to discover... I'll show you. \n[28]Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals... working with Skynet, we're making amazing breakthroughs, well beyond anything possible before Judgment Day. \n[29]We've already freed ourselves from biological limits... soon we'll transcend the laws of physics. \n[30]Right now, we can only go back a few days at most... \n[31]The Resistance leader?   You know him? \n[32]He's a dangerous man. Delusional. He thinks he's a savior, but all he's really fighting for is... death. \n[33]Not everyone can become like us, Marcus. We just don't have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids. \n[34]A boy and a girl-- in the last day or two? \n[35]Part of the neural net-- human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence. The processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture. \n[36]Display recent arrivals for processing. \n[37]Next page... \n[38]Good news. He'll soon be part of the network-- you'll be able to connect with him. \n[39]I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus. She didn't suffer. \n[40]I don't know-- I have to go.    Will you be all right? Of course you will. \n[41]Why, Marcus? You were immortal... ", "STAR": "\n[1]Why? We don't need him. \n[2]Seventeen. \n[3]Are you sure? \n[4]Huh? \n[5]Judgment Day... I was just a baby. \n[6]Now! \n[7]Yes! \n[8]Yuk! \n[9]You can read. \n[10]Want some? \n[11]What's a joint? \n[12]Just me. \n[13]Whatcha reading? \n[14]Would you read something to me? \n[15]There's a book inside with pictures. \n[16]What's that? \n[17]So... all those numbers... you could call them and get, like, flowers, or someone to come over and fix stuff, or bring you food... \n[18]Music? \n[19]I don't remember music. \n[20]Somebody used to sing that to me. \n[21]Stay with us, Marcus.

To be... one of them? ", "CONNOR": "\n[1]Not what I expected... \n[2]I-- I need to know what you are. \n[3]This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet.

I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins... \n[5]Besides, the first T-800s won't be manufactured until `26. \n[6]I want him extracted. \n[7]Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick.

I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die... \n[10]So how could I not know about this?! \n[11]I need to talk to the prisoner. \n[12]Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor. \n[13]At ease.   Please, sit. \n[14]I've gone over your record, lieutenant. You're a good soldier, flown a lot of missions...

I just didn't know how. \n[20]My father. \n[21]What is it? \n[22]Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources.

I'm glad you made it. \n[26]Seems I owe you an apology. \n[27]The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place.

You trying to seduce me again? \n[21]What can I say? It's our duty to repopulate the planet. \n[22]C'mere. \n[23]You're so twentieth century... \n[24]Admit it, I'm the best you ever had... ", "JEREMY": "\n[1]Are you all right? \n[2]You look like you've been hit by a truck-- \n[3]The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll take you there. \n[4]This round was gonna blow my handicap anyway. I'm Jeremy. \n[5]I can't connect with you at all... your interface must've been damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new. \n[6]Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some? \n[7]Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on. \n[8]It's a foam resin. It can taste like anything you want it to-- but of course, we don't really need to eat. Our brains are powered by fuel cells, remember? \n[9]We're in a transitional phase. Most of us need the comfort of the familiar a little while longer-- food, shelter, sex. Until we forget the old life. \n[10]Eating-- well, chewing-- it's one of the hardest habits to break... but before long, none of this will be necessary. We won't even need these bodies. \n[11]We don't call them that here. \n[12]A hybrid.    The same as you. \n[13]Of course. That's what this community is for-- people like us. \n[14]You should be grateful to have been chosen. \n[15]You mean like Janet and the kids. \n[16]`Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think? \n[17]Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel-- \n[18]Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe. \n[19]We replaced the body's hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure-- analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals, controlling the micro-tech chassis-- \n[20]The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics. \n[21]The facility is just ahead. I'll let them know you're coming. ", "KATE": "\n[1]He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton. \n[2]Where did they find him? \n[3]Because people trust you... you give them faith-- \n[4]\n[5]What is it, John? \n[6]What?   Find who? \n[7]All to find one teenage boy...? John, you really think this can work? \n[8]Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid. \n[9]He wants to see you. \n[10]Kyle, could you give us a minute? \n[11]Marcus... you're going to need to be rebuilt. Your face, your body, your voice... We have people who can do it. \n[12]But you won't be the same... \n[13]The scar will help hide the change. \n[14]We can't keep him alive much longer. Very few people know what John actually looks like. Only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth. \n[15]Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp... you're a hero. \n[16]Please.   We need you. ", "BOY": "\n[1]Hey mister, where you goin' in such a hurry? \n[2]Whoah, whoah-- hang on there.   Got any food? \n[3]You look like you been eating pretty good. \n[4]This sure ain't heaven. \n[5]Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff? \n[6]Texas! \n[7]Do what he says. \n[8]Do it, Star. Put it down. \n[9]The city? Oh man. That place is red hot. \n[10]No-- radiation. \n[11]Get down, they've seen the light! \n[12]It's an H-K-- hunter-killer.   Where the hell have you been? ", "MORRISON": "\n[1]Start up the generator, Barnes. \n[2]Son of a bitch is heavy. \n[3]How can he be? \n[4]Winning your trust would aid his infiltration. \n[5]We're trying to-- \n[6]Then it's already too late. This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? \n[7]Not yet-- not for years. So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- \n[8]You can skip the act, we know what you are. \n[9]Who does? \n[10]John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was-- Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity. \n[11]Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret. \n[12]Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP. ", "GIRL": "\n[1]Let him go! \n[2]He'll kill us both! \n[3]There was only one bullet in that gun. \n[4]It wasn't loaded. \n[5]Can I have my gun back? \n[6]Where'd you get those? \n[7]Rads musta fried his brains.   Let's go, Kyle. ", "JANE": "\n[1]He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces... \n[2]Does he have a prosthetic limb? \n[3]This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God-- \n[4]He's a terminator. \n[5]Thermoplastic skin, some larger hydraulics, but mostly titanium microgears... This looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system, function unclear at this point. Valves and what looks like an access panel below the ribcage... \n[6]Eyes are polymer optics, very lifelike. Lead shielding all around the skull, presumably to protect the CPU. \n[7]Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this? ", "ENGINEER": "\n[1]32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here... \n[2]32581 looks good... \n[3]32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass. \n[4]32581 looks good... 32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass. \n[5]What?   Who are you? \n[6]You can't hurt me. "}}
