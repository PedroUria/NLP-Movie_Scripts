You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos. \n[130]I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket.

I guess I'm yours now. \n[137]Hey. Where's Monkeybone? \n[138]Back? You're sending me back? \n[139]Death! Thank you! \n[140]Baby...you're asking the wrong guy. \n[141]My tail itches.

The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... That boy looked like pluperfect hell. \n[20]Switch hands. \n[21]I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out. \n[22]Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that.

What the hell is that?? \n[7]...What?? \n[8]Well - whatever it is - you get that shroud to the dry cleaner ASAP! Now where were we? \n[9]Oh, wait. Says here he's supposed to recover. \n[10]Take this to Dark Town. Sad to say, he's gonna live another forty years. Sorry. Nobody said this job would be easy. \n[11]...I beg your pardon? \n[12]Now what were you saying? \n[13]I'd like to have a word with you in private. \n[14]\n[15]HYPNOS! That little twerp! He's the one who put you up to this! \n[16]Head. HEAD!! \n[17]Now we've got 'em. \n[18]Now, if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks into the Land of Death twice? \n[19]Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all his idea. You were completely innocent - \n[20]Why?? \n[21]I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is so irresponsible. \n[22]Well - you'd need a body. \n[23]If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die. \n[24]De nada. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind. \n[25]I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go? \n[26]Back in your head, where he belongs. No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him. \n[27]It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the \"Family Circus\" guy instead. \n[28]Thank me next time you see me. \n[29]Ohhhh, Hypnos?? ", "HERB": "\n[1]Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is, Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an order for six new episodes! \n[2]Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu Miley! \n[3]Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys - \n[4]Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here... \n[5]Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God - \n[6]Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth! \n[7]Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them. \n[8]Why? \n[9]Oh my God...you're proposing? \n[10]...In some weird way I respect that. \n[11]Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop the question - tonight. Or else. Get me? \n[12]They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look at 'em before you say no... If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're expecting a couple more trucks. \n[13]Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go. \n[14]I tell you, he's ready to merchandise. We've gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger guys, the lunchbox guys - \n[15]What's the matter? \n[16]Less. \n[17]Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit. \n[18]Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to cover it. \n[19]And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like. \n[20]A pi\u00f1ata. That's a great idea! \n[21]Head trauma. \n[22]You're really gonna pop the question? \n[23]I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit. \n[24]CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working together. All of them. Shirts...pants... ", "ALICE": "\n[1]Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over. \n[2]Special occasion? \n[3]Don't get all poignant. We're keeping this bottle on ice. When he comes around you're going to need it. \n[4]Who did this? \n[5]When he first came in to the sleep lab? \n[6]Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing him, but I never realized what you cured him from. \n[7]How do you get from here - to there? \n[8]What? \n[9]Monkeybone? \n[10]Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with? \n[11]Most we've ever used is half a CC. \n[12]Julie, that stuff probably saved his life. \n[13]Listen. Let's bring him in for some tests. I guarantee you're overreacting. \n[14]They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet. \n[15]This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could be innocent people in danger. \n[16]I didn't want to tell you this, but the other day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you have to tell the police. \n[17]Detective, please let this man out of the van. ", "KITTY": "\n[1]Hiya, Stu. Refill on that martini? \n[2]Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense. \n[3]Hypnos? \n[4]She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys like you don't come along that often. Believe me, I know. \n[5]I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million. \n[6]Good for him! He's gonna wake up! \n[7]I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you. \n[8]You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her. \n[9]No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him. Oh, Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu. \n[10]Let's not think about dogs. Let's think about pussycats. Meeowwwwwwrrrr.... \n[11]Shh! You'll need it when you're traveling. \n[12]Don't ask where I got it. \n[13]You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy. \n[14]I'll worry about the guards. \n[15]Go. Just go. ", "BULL": "\n[1]New in town, huh? What're you drinking? \n[2]Animals? What kind of animals? \n[3]Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking? \n[4]Olive or eyeball? \n[5]Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull. \n[6]Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here. \n[7]I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on every channel...all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra anchovies. \n[8]Sad commentary, huh? \n[9]I beg your pardon? \n[10]Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist here. \n[11]Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare. \n[12]Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini. \n[13]An E-Ticket!

How about you? You're okay? \n[3]I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring. \n[4]Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked me to send it to him - \n[5]Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances? \n[6]But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right? \n[7]Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last? \n[8]Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it - \n[9]Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a long time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out. \n[10]Give me a date, Doctor. \n[11]I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months. \n[12]This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... I gave the order. \n[13]I just couldn't stand the thought of you suffering. I love you so, I would never have... forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me. ", "STANLEY": "\n[1]It was third grade. The teacher was Miss Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she smelled funny - but she was kind. \n[2]You know how some teachers have those, kind of, flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp flab that like, dangle? \n[3]It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to feel...well...oddly... \n[4]...aroused. And then the horror began. \n[5]It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument. And then...all at once ...there he was. \n[6]Monkeybone!! \n[7]How about it, Doc? Can you help me? \n[8]One question, doc - what did you mean when you said \"imaginary\"? \n[9]Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a good shrink. ", "HAND WOMAN": "\n[1]Hyp?

Let's go where the real fun is. \n[5]You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff before it goes out to the theatres. \n[6]Shh! There's a new one just starting. \n[7]Stu!! What are you doing?
