{"dialogues": {"JERRY": "\n[1]Easy now, we can spread these numbers over five years... \n[2]Listen, there's no proof of anything except that this guy is a sensational athlete. \n[3]Yes! \n[4]Come on -- it'd take a tank to stop your dad.  It would take all five Super Trooper VR Warriors, right? \n[5]Thanks. \n[6]Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh, listen did those manuscripts get... Oh they did... No no no no no, that's fine... \n[7]Jerry in suit, alone with his luggage.  Dry throat. clammy, holds onto the handrail to steady himself. \n[8]I have to ask. \n[9]Where'd you find the perfect white shirt? \n[10]Jerry Maguire.  SMI. \n[11]Well.  Good luck with that -- \n[12]I think you'll know when you see him at the gate. \n[13]I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet. \n[14]She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now... \n[15]No no... \n[16]--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui... \n[17]A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months. \n[18]Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there. \n[19]To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- \"Hurry up, klutz.\" \n[20]Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel -- \n[21]But wait... \n[22]Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, \"Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.\" And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said \"yes\" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February. \n[23]You'll know when you see him. You'll know when you see him. \n[24]Can I help? \n[25]I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body. \n[26]Now what did you lose? \n[27]Well, while I go look for him, why don't you hang onto this curious gentleman behind you -- \n[28]Well, take care. \n[29]No no. I knew. \n[30]No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called \"my twenties.\" See you later. \n[31]Thanks... actually, it was just a \"Mission Statement.\" \n[32]You think so? \n[33]I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and... \n[34]Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride? \n[35]Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure. \n[36]... three, swing. \n[37]Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop. \n[38]You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything! \n[39]I know about the bachelor party. \n[40]One of the accountants. \n[41]Oh come on -- \n[42]You're imagining it. \n[43]Dooler, you know Bob Sugar. \n[44]... this is... uh... too funny... \n[45]Thanks, Wendy. \n[46]Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife? \n[47]Tyson, hello. \n[48]How can I make your life better? \n[49]Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock. \n[50]Not a chance. \n[51]Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention. \n[52]Damn right. \n[53]Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet... \n[54]I'm fine.  What's up? \n[55]Pardon me? \n[56]Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene... \n[57]You... \n[58]You... ungrateful... unctuous... \n[59]Dick. \n[60]You'll lose. \n[61]I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too. \n[62]-- and I'll get 'em. \n[63]Carla, right now you're paying 25% of your endorsments to SMI, I would cut my commission by 7%... \n[64]And when I got you that big contract in Chicago, and the fan poll in the Sun-Times was 93% against you, who went and found you that sympathetic journalist who turned it all around, it was me... \n[65]SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team... \n[66]-- personal attention -- \n[67]-- a family of athletes -- \n[68]Kathy!  Hi, it's Jerry Maguire. \n[69]Still me, Kathy. \n[70]Rod! How ya doing? Jerry Maguire. \n[71]I hear what you're saying... \n[72]Okay. \n[73]Now you want Arizona dollars. \n[74]I need a decision from you, Rod. \n[75]Mmm.  Hmm. \n[76]Yes. \n[77]I got it. \n[78]Show.  Me.  The.  Money. \n[79]Well, don't worry!  I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do, which is FLIP OUT! \n[80]Jerry goes to a water dispenser, calming himself, and fills a small Dixie cup.  Downs it and fills it again, rubbing his face.. \n[81]But let me just say, as I ease out of the office I helped build -- sorry, but it's a fact -- \n[82]-- that there is such a thing as manners.  A way of treating people... \n[83]These fish have manners!  They have manners. \n[84]In fact.  They're coming with me! I'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me and... you can call me sentimental. \n[85]it's okay... it's okay... \n[86]But if anybody else wants to come with me, this moment will be the ground floor of something real and fun and inspiring and true in this godforsaken business and we will do it together!  Who's coming with me besides... \"Flipper\" here? \n[87]Anybody going with me? \n[88]Wendy?  Shall we? \n[89]Okay, anybody else? \n[90]Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you! \n[91]We will see you all again.  Sleep tight! \n[92]Let's see how they do without us. \n[93]Wonder what he said. \n[94]Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know. \n[95]Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great. \n[96]But I mean really... wonderfully... great. \n[97]And when you think about what you've done later, don't panic. \n[98]Same to you. \n[99]The power move is to go unannounced. Black suit, right? \n[100]\"Dad says we gwan sleep on it. \n[101]Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. \n[102]I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time. \n[103]That's right. \n[104]Okay, this is working. \n[105]Who said anything about \"loser?\" Where do you get this word \"loser?\" \n[106]Now. \n[107]What if I don't get him? \n[108]No thanks. \n[109]Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me -- \n[110]Oh, thank you. \n[111]You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go. \n[112]It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him. \n[113]I'll give it everything. \n[114]Feelin... \n[115]Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery there? Where can I reach her? \n[116]Hello? \n[117]No, that's fine.  What calls came in today? \n[118]Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery -- \n[119]Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set. \n[120]It's all going to work. \n[121]It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world. \n[122]Happy for us. \n[123]Thanks. \n[124]Avery, I signed Cush.  Again. \n[125]I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there -- \n[126]Well, no you didn't -- \n[127]It's a plan --  -- \n[128]Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars? \n[129]They do, my brother. \n[130]I have no idea. So Ray, if there's an accident or something, it goes pwoooooooof -- -- and you go booooong.  And you're safe. \n[131]Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck. \n[132]Let me think about that.  Want something to drink? \n[133]Wait.  What do you mean? \n[134]This can't be happening to me. \n[135]HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you, five years old?  Am I taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow up, both of you!  We are a family. And we go to the draft in an \n[136]At last I find you. \n[137]Come on.  Come with me.  We're going to take a walk through this lobby. I want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are.  The best- kept secret in the NFL. The biggest wide-receiver in the game. Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever you do, don't sit down. Let 'em see how big you are.  You ready? Let's do it. \n[138]Yeah.  And it might have even worked too. \n[139]I gotta get back to Cushman. \n[140]You know what was great about you down there?  For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather expansive, let me just say \"large\" chip that resides right there on your shoulder, and you know what? You were brilliant.  Take care. \n[141]I'm not about love -- I'm about \"showing you the money.\" \n[142]Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow. \n[143]Call me tomorrow. \n[144]Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make. \n[145]Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big. \n[146]He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England -- they want him bad. \n[147]Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. Million. \n[148]Just be friendly and say \"no comment.\" \n[149]\"This is Cush.\" \n[150]\"No comment. \n[151]Look, before I go back to Denver. I think we should put something down on paper.  Something that says, \"hey, I'm with Jerry Maguire.\" \n[152]Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you? \n[153]Said who?  Sugar? \n[154]So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back? \n[155]I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door. \n[156]It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll fix this up.  You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right? \n[157]Shut up! I'm sorry... sorry. \n[158]Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your \"my word is stronger'n oak\" thing -- \n[159]Well. Okay. Of course. You're twenty years old, and I'm just another guy in a suit.  It's all business. It didn't work out.  You didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm. Let me see, there's a speech that I'm supposed to make -- right! -- \"I'll be out there cheering for you.\" \"The door is always open!\"  See? I'm a class act. But maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now I'll never know. You'll never know. Weren't you curious? No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine. And you'll be fine.  And Keith I bope you do call me. \n[160]I'm sorry... excuse me... \n[161]What do I do?  How do I spin this? \n[162]What did I do to you? \n[163]Could you just stop moving? \n[164]Everything's on the fucking run! Everything -- \n[165]Look, I don't want a -- \n[166]Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. \n[167]Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty.. \n[168]I think you added the \"brutal.\" \n[169]Avery -- \n[170]-- stop -- \n[171]Listen to me! \n[172]It's over -- \n[173]There is something missing here. \n[174]Listen to me, it's over. \n[175]I'm not trying to make history. \n[176]No. \n[177]You know I didn't ever want to hurt you. \n[178]Very much. \n[179]Rod -- \n[180]What are you doing with me, Rod? \n[181]Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale! \n[182]See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on \"do not do this\" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom! \n[183]The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic -- \n[184]It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. \n[185]Why not? \n[186]Another drink please. \n[187]Oh my God. \n[188]Okay, turn here!  Sharp right turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo. \n[189]Yes, good, floor it, kill us!! \n[190]I'm Jerry Maguire. \n[191]Honesty.  Thank you. \n[192]Hi. \n[193]Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy? \n[194]I'm glad you're home.  That \"alone\" thing is... not my specialty... \n[195]Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery. \n[196]Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here. \n[197]And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted. \n[198]Do you have something to drink? \n[199]My brother works for the White House. He pretends he's an intellectual.  He pretends he's from the east coast. \n[200]I was supposed to be the successful one. \n[201]But I don't want to talk about it. And yet!  My family.  I grew up with repression as a... a religion --you don't bitch.  No moaning!  Head down.  Do it, whatever \"it\" may be. My dad... he worked for the United Way for 38 years!  You know what he said when he retired? He said, \"I wish I'd had a more comfortable chair.\" 38 years he sat in it!  Do you know what I'm saying, Dorothy? Repression as a religion. I'm almost as old as his chair. \n[202]Yeah, thanks. \n[203]Hi Ray. \n[204]Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad. \n[205]Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right. \n[206]All my life I've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen.  You know that feeling? \n[207]Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed. \n[208]Yeah I know.  I did. \n[209]We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands. \n[210]Funny. \n[211]Good idea.  Thank you. \n[212]Right.  Of course. \n[213]Okay.  Lil' speech before I go. \n[214]Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your. Job. Our company is in good shape. You and your son... we... are just fine.  You still have a job. I want you to feel confident!  In. Me.  And I have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire. \n[215]Come after me and you will lose I am a survivor!  Do not underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've got wits! \n[216]I've got the instincts of a panther! I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side! \n[217]We will be fine! \n[218]And I am... \n[219]I am drunk. \n[220]Sure. \n[221]Me too. \n[222]Mission... statement... \n[223]Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment? \n[224]Oh shit.  You said \"boss.\" \n[225]Now I feel like Clarence Thomas. \n[226]No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now. \n[227]Well, good evening. \n[228]We'll be okay.  And I'm going to take my... one client and we're gonna go all the way. \n[229]Hey. I'm back. \n[230]We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis. \n[231]I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation. \n[232]Uh, not today, but -- \n[233]I understand your anxiety. \n[234]That's your word? \n[235]But how did you get \"kwan?\" \n[236]Great word.  Towel? \n[237]Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and -- \n[238]You. \n[239]Here's what I'm saying.  This is a renegotiation.  We want more from them, so let's show them more from us. Let's show them your pure joy of the game, let's bury the Attitude a little, let's show them -- \n[240]No, I'm saying to be -- \n[241]Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it? \n[242]Fine. \n[243]Forget it.  Forget it. \n[244]I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you. \n[245]Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you! I'll see you in L.A.! \n[246]Happy. He said \"happy?\" \n[247]Good.  Good.  Glad is good. \n[248]I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and -- \n[249]Look, the other night, I want to apologize. \n[250]We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere. \n[251]I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again. \n[252]You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that. \n[253]You want to go out to dinner? \n[254]Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie. \n[255]Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were... \n[256]Bye you guys. \n[257]It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, \"it's nobody's fault.\" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it -- \n[258]See, you choose. If you fall for someone, if you make a commitment, you should make it work.  It's only when \"options\" entered the picture that things got bad. I'm speaking historically now.  It's a modern day concept, nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel? -- I think the only good thing to \n[259]come from this period in history is probably the movie \"Annie Hall.\" \n[260]No no no.  I just underestimated her... her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this? \n[261]You want a -- \n[262]What? \n[263]Well -- this would be goodnight. \n[264]I'll see you tomorrow. \n[265]Same to you. \n[266]Right.  I'll come in. \n[267]Oh hell yes. \n[268]Yeah... well... \n[269]Easy, easy -- \n[270]I could pretend I didn't hear, but I won't, I heard everything. Thank you for your honesty, as always. \n[271]Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders prefer cereal first -- \n[272]A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy. \n[273]Look, let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room to a real office. \n[274]Aw shit -- \n[275]I'll go back to them. \n[276]Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem. \n[277]Marcee -- \n[278]Another time, okay Dorothy? \n[279]And I appreciate that impulse. \n[280]If you get injured, you get nothing. \n[281]It's a risk. \n[282]I'll get you some quick work -- \n[283]Don't be silly. \n[284]Don't even talk about that yet. I'll find something fast for Tidwell. We'll stay afloat. \n[285]Bill, Rod, wait -- \n[286]Rod, get on the camel. \n[287]Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway. \n[288]Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career? \n[289]What do you know about dating a single mother? \n[290]Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego. \n[291]How do I know? \n[292]No, I don't know. \n[293]But I sure don't like that she's leaving. \n[294]The kid is amazing. \n[295]I didn't \"shoplift the pooty.\"  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- Alright, I shoplifted the pooty. \n[296]Right up ahead, buddy -- \n[297]-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of... \n[298]It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of... \n[299]The Two-Headed Corn Snake. \n[300]Both heads have brains.  Both heads eat, both heads battle for direction all day long. Man, can I relate. \n[301]I'm not good at this. \n[302]I'll see you this weekend, okay? Promise. \n[303]Sure you're okay to drive this? \n[304]So I'll see you this weekend. \n[305]... I love you too, you know. \n[306]What -- \n[307]Wait a second. \n[308]\n[309]I know a way to s... to save on Medical and rent and... look... \n[310]...  what if we stayed together? What if we uh... got married. \n[311]If I said that, would you stay? \n[312]Will you marry me? \n[313]In the band. \n[314]Yeah, we did. \n[315]Glad we had this talk! \n[316]No. \n[317]How's your head? Bubblicious. \n[318]I'm a little worried -- \n[319]We can still take the offer, Rod. \n[320]Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan. \n[321]I'll see you in Arizona. \n[322]Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster. \n[323]What's that supposed to mean? \n[324]I don't know -- how's \"dedication\" for an answer? \n[325]Why are you doing this to me, Rod? \n[326]No, you're -- \n[327]Not everyone has what you have. \n[328]You're jabbing at me. \n[329]No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you. Loyalty.  She was loyal. Everything grew from there. \n[330]Damn right. \n[331]Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really \"friends?\" \n[332]Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our \"friends\" hats on -- \n[333]Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life? Heart. But when you get on the field -- \n[334]-- you're a businessman.  It's wide-angle lenses and who fucked you over and who owes you for it. That's not what inspires people. I'm sorry, but that's the truth, can you handle it? Just a \"question,\" Rod.  Between friends. \n[335]Fine. \n[336]We still having dinner in L.A.? \n[337]I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible. \n[338]Well, when you wonder, ask me. \n[339]Why do you love me? \n[340]Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll be in Arizona on Monday... \n[341]What -- \n[342]Tell me -- let me help -- \n[343]Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick. \n[344]You want... \n[345]...my soul or something. \n[346]Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way? \n[347]What if it's true?  \"Great at friendship bad at intimacy.\" I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film -- \n[348]I don't like to give up. \n[349]What about Ray? \n[350]So this break... is a break-up. \n[351]Don't wake up... \n[352]...  it was just a Mission Statement... \n[353]Get the fuck away from my guy, Sugar. \n[354]Go.  Flee. \n[355]I missed ya.  What can I say? \n[356]He took a shot.  He's unconscious. \n[357]Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there. \n[358]Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. \n[359]\n[360]Hello. It's Marcee.  She says she couldn't get through on your phone. \n[361]Tommy.  I love you. \n[362]Hello.  I'm looking for my wife. \n[363]Alright.  If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen. \n[364]I'm not letting you get rid of me. How about that? \n[365]This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh -- I love you.  You complete me. \n[366]Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you at the restaurant. ", "DOROTHY": "\n[1]Look, my son is allergic to the material in these blankets - \n[2]It's okay.  We're in it together now... \n[3]Oh, tell the story. \n[4]Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping. \n[5]First class is what's wrong.  It used to be a better meal.  Now it's a better life. \n[6]Ray! Ray! \n[7]Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm -- \n[8]Hmm.  Pretty good. \n[9]My son... my mind... \n[10]Remember \"imagination?\"... remember what that means?  Well, this is one of my bosses so you will now IMAGINE me screaming at you right now. Do NOT do that again.  Ever ever EVER. \n[11]Well, thanks. \n[12]And have fun at your bachelor party. \n[13]Oh no. \n[14]Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise. \n[15]I loved your memo, by the way. \n[16]I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act. \n[17]Oh tsht. Yes. \n[18]-- the part about \"we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm\" -- \n[19]-- \"and we should all force open the tightly-clenched fist of commerce, and give a little back for the greater good.\". I mean, I was inspired, and I'm an accountant.  Ray, don't spill my coffee. \n[20]Hey.  To respect yourself enough to say it out loud, to put yourself out there, so openly... ... I don't know, it got me. \n[21]Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye. \n[22]Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must be some classy babe -- \n[23]What's going on? \n[24]I'll go with you. Wonderful... \n[25]My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said \"you complete me.\" \n[26]So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right? \n[27]And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in -- \n[28]No no, I know -- \n[29]Absolutely. \n[30]Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good bet. \n[31]That took guts. \n[32]Of course, medical! \n[33]If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too. \n[34]Of course I know -- \n[35]Wait. Where is he? \n[36]Wonderful.  Next time you lecture me, don't leave my little boy in a room with your Divorced Women's Group... \n[37]Shhhh! \n[38]Come on, buddy, we're going to bed. \n[39]What did I do? \n[40]Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta, didn't leave me her hotel number. \n[41]Honey -- later, okay? Whoop.  Wait. \n[42]Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff. \n[43]Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is... \n[44]... light. \n[45]We are? \n[46]I just got goosebumps. \n[47]Well, I'm happy for you. \n[48]Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222. \n[49]Call me later, hon. \n[50]Wait.  Did I just say \"hon\" to him? \n[51]Twenty six years old.  I'm already saying \"hon\". Hug your mother quickly -- \n[52]Avery'll meet you at the B gate at 4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will already be there. \n[53]... I put Tidwell on the same floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I think it's great you're taking him to the draft. He doesn't smoke, right? I have no idea. \n[54]Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right? \n[55]He's coming over. \n[56]He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over. \n[57]Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in. \n[58]'Night buddy.  This is my favorite part of your head. \n[59]Hey you. \n[60]He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp. \n[61]Oh my God. \n[62]Too bad. \n[63]Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it? \n[64]Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too. \n[65]Sure -- \n[66]Beer okay? \n[67]No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen. \n[68]Thank you. \n[69]That's the girl I love. \n[70]As opposed to twenty angry women? \n[71]Okay, you want to talk about practical? Let's talk about my wonderful life. Do you know what most other women my age are doing right now? They are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man... not me. I'm trying to RAISE a man. \n[72]I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look? \n[73]Thanks. \n[74]Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab. \n[75]So.  Our company. \n[76]Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs -- \n[77]-- especially one like this. \n[78]Truth? \n[79]Sure, I care about the job.  Of course.  But mostly... ...  I want to be inspired. \n[80]What you wrote inspired me. \n[81]I'm working with you because of that memo... \n[82]Well. \n[83]Don't worry about it, boss. \n[84]Yeah, I did. \n[85]No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas. \n[86]I may not sue. \n[87]Good evening. \n[88]Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy. \n[89]Actually he said \"glad.\" \n[90]Plus, you could use that commission. \n[91]You don't have to explain. \n[92]Yeah, what happened there. \n[93]I'm relieved you said that. \n[94]Oh good. \n[95]Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. \n[96]Think about everything that's gone wrong, how to fix them, and just be... alone, alone, alone. \n[97]Hey, looks like you've got a fan. \n[98]Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny? \n[99]Don't let him stay up too late. \n[100]Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense. \n[101]We'll see you soon, honey. Bye. \n[102]That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? I mean, he must have been needing that. \n[103]Oh, knock it off! \n[104]Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but -- \n[105]We work together. \n[106]Maybe you should call her. \n[107]No.  No way. \n[108]Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- Jerry? \n[109]Let's not tell our sad stories. \n[110]I'll be right back. Quit thinking those murky thoughts, okay? We're young, we're semi-successful. Life is good. \n[111]No, now... come on... let Chad catch the bee in a glass.  He won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got such a good heart. I love you, I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to see you. \n[112]Come on, let's take a walk. \n[113]Good night. \n[114]Good night. \n[115]I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel. \n[116]No.  I have to go in.  I live here. \n[117]Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this? \n[118]He's asleep, right? \n[119]Still going. \n[120]Shhh. \n[121]What is this MUSIC? \n[122]I'm getting him up, don't worry.' Ray will never see his mother's raging physical needs. \n[123]No-- \n[124]Please, if I start talking -- \n[125]... so what am I, for taking the opportunity, Laurel? \n[126]Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am I a bad person? All I know is that I found someone who was charming and popular and not-so-nice to me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why should I let this guy go, when everything in my body says This One is The One. \n[127]Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him. \n[128]Oh God. \n[129]That was great of you this morning. \n[130]How about a little piece of integrity in this world that is so filled with greed and a lack of honorability that I don't know what to tell my kid except take a look at a guy who isn't shouting \"show me the money,\" he's quietly broke and working for you for free! Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good at the insults as she is. \n[131]In fact, you should read something that meant the world to me... \n[132]Fine, I just -- \n[133]Take care you guys. \n[134]Look...  I was up for a job in San Diego before I left SMI. It's with the Chargers. \n[135]They offered me everything I asked for, it's only 2 hours away. I think it's good for us. \n[136]Two heads.  My God... \n[137]Is this a guy thing? \n[138]This rig? Phht.  No problem. \n[139]Airight, so goodbye and -- I love you. \n[140]Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever... Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it. \n[141]No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't... \n[142]Wow.  We actually -- \n[143]What were you thinking tonight? Watching them go through the complete human emotional experience? \n[144]Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours. \n[145]And I really don't know your noises yet. \n[146]Okay... I will... \n[147]Why do you love me? \n[148]It's my fault. \n[149]It's not fair to you.  This whole -- \n[150]I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now. \n[151]I don't need you to \"stick.\" \n[152]I don't know -- \n[153]Why fucking not!  I deserve it. \n[154]I think we made a mistake here. \n[155]I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart. \n[156]Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, \"responsible\"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break. \n[157]There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends. \n[158]Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me. \n[159]I mean, on the surface, you'd almost think everything was fine. See, I've got this great guy who loves my kid -- -- and he sure does like me a lot. \n[160]I can't live that way.  It's not the way I'm \"built.\" \n[161]I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories, and I have been very judgmental. Frankly, I think you've all been waaaay too comfortable with your pain.  Plus, Jan, you always spill your red wine on the couch. I've not been fair to you.  Women need to stick together, and not depend on the affections of a man to \"fix\" their lives.  Maybe you're all correct. Men are the enemy. \n[162]But I still love the enemy. \n[163]Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. ", "TIDWELL": "\n[1]No.  I hear that you hear what I'm saying.  But do you hear what I'm saying? \n[2]Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to. \n[3]Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain \"get killed, catch the ball.\" That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!! \n[4]Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire -- \n[5]--  the house is fallin' apart, we don't even know where we're gonna live in a year, and I'm supposed to be a \"superstar,\" man!  Are you catching my flow, here? \n[6]--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening? \n[7]It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready? \n[8]Here it is.  \"Show me the money.\" Show.  Me.  The.  Money. \n[9]Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me. \n[10]Congratulations.  You're still my agent. \n[11]No man, I'm not Hootie. \n[12]Hey man, I wish I had a quarterback like you in Arizona. You're the shit. \n[13]Well you ain't that mothafuckin good. \n[14]I said -- last I heard, Jesus Christ was still in heaven.  And you ain't even played in the NFL. \n[15]Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese. \n[16]Heard that. \n[17]Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom. \n[18]A'right.  Let's walk. \n[19]I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby? \n[20]Let's do it again. \n[21]You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story? \n[22]Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me... \n[23]You're loving me now, aren't ya? \n[24]Good.  I was just testing ya. But just you saying that? Makes me love ya. \n[25]Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man -- \n[26]I might call you later! \n[27]You love me now, don't you? \n[28]Everybody on this show cries now. \n[29]You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother? \n[30]Huh? \n[31]Well, boo-fucking-hoo. \n[32]No. \n[33]You are not allowed to act this way. \n[34]Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your \"nya nya nya.\" \n[35]Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money. \n[36]Did you tell him about the \"ten million for four years?\" \n[37]John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table. \n[38]Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the \"coin.\"  It's the... \n[39]--  the kwan. \n[40]Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan. \n[41]I got there from \"coin,\" dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan. \n[42]No, I air-dry. \n[43]Is that your porty or mine? \n[44]Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin' in the new agent.  He says I'm not marquee.  I know... I know... \n[45]My wife is upset with you. \n[46]You're telling me to dance. \n[47]\"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.\" That's the iconography of rascism, man! \n[48]Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance. \n[49]I'm an athlete, not an entertainer. These are the ABC's of ME.  Get it? I don't dance. \n[50]What's wrong. \n[51]No tell me. \n[52]You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you. \n[53]See, man, that's the difference. between us.  You think we're fighting, I think we're finally talking! \n[54]I feel like crying.  I feel like breaking the room up. \n[55]No shit. \n[56]Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans. \n[57]If you say take the shitty deal, that's all we can get -- \n[58]Can I SPEAK with my agent here? \n[59]Honey, you are just -- \n[60]-- the shit. \n[61]Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind. \n[62]Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like I bet on you. \n[63]Good deal, man. \n[64]Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME. \n[65]Jerry, back me up.  It's either the camel or me... \n[66]There you go, dude.  You're learning how to represent me.  We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad -- \n[67]Oh, we gonna be friends now? \n[68]Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother. \n[69]First, single mothers don't \"date.\" They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her? \n[70]You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know? \n[71]Then you gotta have The Talk. \n[72]Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. \n[73]No.  A real man does not shoplift the \"pooty\" from a single mom. \n[74]Shame on you.  SHAME on you. \n[75]You never had The Talk, did you? \n[76]Well, this was another way to go. \n[77]This is my agent, man!  And we're all gonna have a great season! \n[78]Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed. \n[79]I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago. \n[80]Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd don't discuss gambling with me. \n[81]No. \n[82]Hey, that's my word, okay? \n[83]I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers. \n[84]Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife. \n[85]Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone. \n[86]You don't want to go home, do you? \n[87]I'm asking you a question -- \n[88]I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage? \n[89]Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend. \n[90]I'm sorry I asked. \n[91]That's an answer. \n[92]For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married. \n[93]Why not -- \n[94]I think so. \n[95]I don't want to be friends anymore. \n[96]Beautiful. \n[97]Only 'cause my wife likes your wife! \n[98]\"No heart.\"  \"No heart?\" I'm all heart, motherfucker! \n[99]I hate you going to movies alone withoutme -- \n[100]What baby? \n[101]Shouldn't you be out there doing some pickle dance or something -- Pickle Man nods and goes out to dance for the crowd. \n[102]Get outta here.  Go. \n[103]Don't know. \n[104]Jerry!  You made it -- \n[105]Thanks for coming. \n[106]Wait. \n[107]Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for a minute. \n[108]Nike. \n[109]We did it. \n[110]One love... you got to share it... \n[111]No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry. \n[112]I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out? \n[113]Wanna send some beautiful love out to my offensive line, just a beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna thank a beautiful individual -- God, and of course the entire Arizona organization, a little slow, but they do come around. I'm leaving somebody out... \n[114]Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan. \n[115]And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it... \n[116]Wait!  And thank you Melvin from the Casual Man, thank you for the suit... ", "AVERY": "\n[1]Don't ever stop fucking me! \n[2]Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!! \n[3]Never BETTER!! \n[4]Open your eyes. If you ever want me to be with another woman for you, I would do it.  I'm not interested in it. There was a time, yes, it felt normal for me, but it was a phase, a college thing, like torn Levi's or law school for you... people change, but if you ever feel like being adventurous in that way, I would do it for you.  You want anything from the kitchen I'm going to get some fruit -- \n[5]Jerry, this is what intimacy is! \n[6]Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey. \n[7]Who told you? \n[8]Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film. All those guys from the office are coming.  Everybody loves you.  Just calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time.  And you'll never guess who narrates your bachelor movie. \n[9]And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush? \n[10]Ugh! \n[11]Good. They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you. \n[12]Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire. \n[13]King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room! \n[14]You are not a loser. \n[15]I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave? \n[16]Let's go.  I'll drive you. \n[17]Function function function. Forward motion is everything. Cush saves all. \n[18]Wait a minute, it has to be one of the NFL hotels we do business with -- let me look -- but in the meantime, about this job -- \n[19]\n[20]Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either -- \n[21]You lost your head, it happens. I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft? \n[22]I'll set it up with your girl. Woo!

You and I are salespeople. We sell -- \n[29]It's not \"love me.\"  It's not \"trust my handshake.\"  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be \"confusion\" about that. \n[30]So honesty is outlawed here, I can't be honest? \n[31]What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember? \n[32]Jerry, there is a \"sensitivity\" thing that some people have.  I don't have it.  I don't cry at movies.  I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early, and I don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives -- 'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For better or worse.  But I do love you. \n[33]Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now. \n[34]I'm warning you.  Don't say it.

You... you should say something. \n[11]I know.  It sucks.  I suck. \n[12]You did this to yourself.  You said \"fewer clients.\"  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself -- \n[13]-- although I do gotta hand it to you.  For about five minutes you had everyone applauding smaller revenues. \n[14]... dick? \n[15]Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!

Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters -- \n[19]Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya first 'cause you're the most important guy in sports... \n[20]You read that memo I snuck to you, the guy's tired of the job.  Tired of making you money. \n[21]He's costing you money, Debra... he's oldschool. \n[22]I've got the clients.  I've got the juice. \n[23]-- more money, more endorsements -- \n[24]-- the millenium, eight-hundred channels more endorsements. Think of me, think of dollars. \n[25]It's not show \"friends\".

Well, that tells you a lot.  Hold on, gotta cough... \n[28]So Jennifer... \n[29]Killer, Steve, good decision. So it's yes, right?  Excellente. Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES! \n[30]It's Sugar.  He must be there, right? Just sniff or something if he's there. Alright, buddydude.  Just remember. You're swimming with the big boys now. You let your dad do all the talking.  I'm the one who got you the deal you needed.  This is business not friendship. Be strong.  You're global now. \n[31]Listen, I spoke to your quarterback. He's my client, you know.  And I said, \"take care to get those passes down, let Tidwell look good on t.v.\" \n[32]You should let me do more for you. I would have had you your deal by tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend of mine. I would have had him on the air, talking about you, tonight, when it counts. \n[33]Where's your agent tonight? \n[34]Rod.  I know this is \"uncool\" to do this now, but you belong with the big boys.

Now I don't know what you do for your four-percent \n[4]You've called our house, right? \n[5]Now I don't know what you do for your five-percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image... we majored in marketing, Jerry, and when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common.  He is pure gold and you're giving him \"Waterbed Warehouse\" when he deserves the big four -- shoe, car, clothing- line, soft-drink.  The four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar. \n[6]You gonna get that -- \n[7]Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it! \n[8]Look at that handsome man, trying to build a life up there by the air-conditioner.

You're a fine, proud, surviving, splendid black man. \n[18]I'm sorry what I said back there. \n[19]My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy. \n[20]Why don't you be the first man in your family not to say that word?

Most important game of your career. \n[23]-- TWENTY minutes of coming attractions. All black films, all violent, I'm talking about brothers shooting brothers, Wesley Snipes with guns the size of our house, killing, blood flowing, cars crashing... blood blood blood blood.

You know -- a Mission Statement -- a suggestion for the future. \n[19]What started out as one page became twenty-five. Suddenly I was my father's son.

I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said: \n[20]And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients.
