Maybe Billy had it coming... \n[53]...because of what he did. \n[54]Why? \n[55]What if...

How can I help you? \n[72]Never heard of him. \n[73]I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men. \n[74]What's this got to do with me? \n[75]Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me... \n[76]Sure, sorry. What do you want to know? \n[77]With my mum... \n[78]You want to speak to her? \n[79]Am I suspect? \n[80]I want you to find out who that guy is. Okay? \n[81]Now. \n[82]You're him... Aren't you? \n[83]The one who killed my brother. \n[84]I came here to kill you. \n[85]I don't know... \n[86]Yes. \n[87]Cause, all my life... I don't know. \n[88]My mother wants me to kill you. \n[89]... I love violence. \n[90]Thai style. \n[91]You can't wear that. \n[92]My mother's... Very particular about colours. \n[93]She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else. \n[94]Come on. \n[95]Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me. \n[96]It's Mai, Mum. \n[97]A year and a half isn't it? \n[98]Mum, please... \n[99]I saw her walking down the street. \n[100]And I thought - this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I just walked up to her and started talking. \n[101]Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake. \n[102]Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl. \n[103]Mum! \n[104]The cops came by my club today. \n[105]They're investigating a murder. The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning. \n[106]I know it was you, Mum. \n[107]He was there. He was with them. \n[108]The Angel of Vengeance. \n[109]No. \n[110]I'm not going to kill him... \n[111]This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running... \n[112]- his name is Chang- \n[113]Mum, don't talk to her like that. \n[114]Me. \n[115]Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it. \n[116]Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me-- \n[117]-- So you sent him to me and what could I do? \n[118]I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did. \n[119]And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me. \n[120]I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. \n[121]I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... \n[122]Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling. \n[123]It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs. \n[124]That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... \n[125]...that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient. \n[126]Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed. \n[127]I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why? \n[128]'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him. \n[129]I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you. \n[130]I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... \n[131]You never did, Mum. \n[132]I'm fine. \n[133]I'll be fine. In a minute. \n[134]Sorry about that. \n[135]Seeing when it hurts. \n[136]Didn't you like what I got you? \n[137]What do you mean? \n[138]Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy. \n[139]Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me. \n[140]Don't go there. \n[141]You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. \n[142]How much do I owe you? \n[143]Come on. \n[144]What are you talking about? \n[145]Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest. \n[146]Yeah, well I lost. \n[147]... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all. \n[148]Nothing. I don't feel anything at all. \n[149]What do you want, Mum? \n[150]What's wrong Mum? \n[151]What's wrong? \n[152]Who does? \n[153]Chang? \n[154]What did you do, Mum? What did you do? \n[155]We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out... \n[156]We're outside. \n[157]I need you here. Right now. \n[158]Okay. \n[159]Let's make a move. \n[160]What's it say? \n[161]The Angel Of Vengeance. \n[162]No way. \n[163]Who said? \n[164]My mother? \n[165]What kind of a mother says that? \n[166]No. We're not doing it. \n[167]Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die... \n[168]Where's is she? \n[169]I'm so fucked... \n[170]... Yeah. \n[171]What did she say? What did she promise you? \n[172]I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave... \n[173]... without saying goodbye. \n[174]My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me. \n[175]I got about twelve grand at the club... Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear... \n[176]Right now. \n[177]Stay here. If I'm not out in five minutes... Go. \n[178]I'm sorry... \n[179]Don't hurt her. \n[180]I'm sorry... \n[181]I don't know... I'm sorry. \n[182]Dark... Darkness. \n[183]No... Never.

Well, not everyone, but... \n[14]Do you want to see a picture? \n[15]What, yeah, thanks. \n[16]It's me... \n[17]I'm in Bangkok... \n[18]I needed to be by myself... \n[19]Raise Hell... \n[20]Could it be have been one of the gangs? \n[21]What do you mean? \n[22]But you're going to find out who did it, right? \n[23]No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying? \n[24]Good. \n[25]Did you kill him? \n[26]Complicated? He killed my son... What's so fucking complicated about that? \n[27]Don't tell me to calm down. I want him dead. \n[28]We don't forgive. Only God does. \n[29]How? \n[30]What are you talking about? \n[31]I don't care. \n[32]Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it. \n[33]The Angel of fucking what...? \n[34]'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things? \n[35]I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill \n[36]How's business? \n[37]What d'you mean? \n[38]I'm here. Julian's here. \n[39]What's gotten into him...? Is he high or something? \n[40]Nothing? \n[41]Not like you... \n[42]So tell me... What did he mean when he said it was complicated? \n[43]So we kill them both. \n[44]Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know? \n[45]So... May, isn't it? \n[46]How long have you two known each other then? \n[47]Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends. \n[48]So, where did you two meet? \n[49]I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world... Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai? \n[50]I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a thousand? \n[51]I know girls like you. Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me. \n[52]I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth. \n[53]What do you know about what's good? \n[54]Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you-- \n[55]Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword... \n[56]I did what had to be done. \n[57]Who? \n[58]D'you kill him? \n[59]Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it? \n[60]Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother. \n[61]That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever \n[62]Chang?! \n[63]Sit down you cunt. \n[64]So what am I left with? \n[65]You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too. \n[66]That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... Do you hear me? \n[67]You could have protected him. \n[68]I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him. \n[69]Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then. \n[70]You would've been a great fighter... You could've gone pro. \n[71]At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me. \n[72]Surprise me. \n[73]Well that seems sensible... And what do you hope that's going to achieve? \n[74]And when you lose, what's going to happen then? \n[75]Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue. \n[76]I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you. \n[77]Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon. \n[78]Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you know. \n[79]You're a piece of work, aren't you? \n[80]No fucking hanging about with you, is there? \n[81]I bet you do. \n[82]We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang? \n[83]My son's guardian angel. \n[84]Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he? \n[85]What did you have in mind? \n[86]I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you? \n[87]Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you? \n[88]Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss... \n[89]You really want to know? \n[90]He killed my son. \n[91]This is Bangkok. Nothing's that expensive. \n[92]He doesn't want to see anyone. \n[93]Just give him time... \n[94]Of course. \n[95]We'll get him through this together. \n[96]You deserved to win. You should've \n[97]I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win. \n[98]And did it make a difference? \n[99]I want to know... Did it make a difference? \n[100]And how do you feel now? \n[101]Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died... \n[102]What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be... I don't want to lose you... \n[103]He knows... He knows it was me. \n[104]He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you. \n[105]I'm scared, Julian. \n[106]What are we going to do? \n[107]Not just him. We've got to take them all out. \n[108]Kill them all. The final solution. \n[109]I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed. \n[110]Tonight. \n[111]I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away. \n[112]I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life. \n[113]I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer. \n[114]... It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son... But he hasn't been a son to me. \n[115]Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home... That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him.
