You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. \n[10]I think I know what this is about. \n[11]Sounds like you're firing me. \n[12]UniMart is firing me... \n[13]Why me? 9. \n[14]Why not Strang? \n[15]I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. \n[16]I won't make the Front Office? \n[17]I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then... \n[18]I thought I was Employee of the Month. \n[19]No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house... \n[20]Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys.

I could spill you some 411. \n[38]I know their trade secrets. \n[39]And I'm ready to learn new strategies. I'll stop by again so you can keep me in mind. \n[40]I'll work every day. \n[41]As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago. \n[42]Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the client\u00e8le too A Number 1. \n[43]No charity today. I got things to do. \n[44]Nothing. I was just saying that. \n[45]They said it's because I didn't go to college. \n[46]Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever. \n[47]I love you too. \n[48]Hard to do. \n[49]Aren't there unemployed engineers and geophysicists? \n[50]You won the Lottery. \n[51]I'll see if there's a class in here for PowerBall 250. 22. \n[52]They give these away free. \n[53]First time.

I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me. \n[63]I woke up this morning so nervous about the first day of school. I changed my clothes three times. \n[64]I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm babbling. \n[65]I like this guy... \n[66]Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school. You ever come across a moped or a scooter for sale or trade? \n[67]\"College Graduate.\" \n[68]That's a hunk of junk. \n[69]It doesn't work. \n[70]Two hundred. \n[71]Two hundred. \n[72]Two hundred. \n[73]Forget it. \n[74]All I need is the open road. \n[75]It still works. \n[76]Speck-tack-alar. Nice machine. Where you headed? \n[77]School. College. I'm a student. What do you do? \n[78]Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating the 35. \n[79]You take care. \n[80]Got me here for a nickel's worth of gas. \n[81]I am? \n[82]It's only been one day \n[83]New to the sport. \n[84]Larry Crowne. With an 'e'. \n[85]Not much fashion sense. \n[86]Gotta go! \n[87]You mean me? \n[88]My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. \"How to make French Toast\", but I'll speak English... \n[89]Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle. \n[90]That went fast... \n[91]Why not. \n[92]I just bought it and ride around. \n[93]Other than school, I have nothing to do. \n[94]I know where a yard sale is, like everyday. \n[95]Follow me, boys and girl! \n[96]College buddies. \n[97]Entrez vous, sea food plate. \n[98]Good choice. \n[99]I did most of the cooking, actually. You know about Denise? \n[100]The usual stuff between three people. \n[101]Dark. \n[102]Stay outta my way. \n[103]Cooking for friends is sort of fun. Three hundred times a day is not. \n[104]He is? \n[105]'We'll be right back after these messages.' \n[106]Capice. \n[107]L rry. \n[108]Peace indeed. 48. \n[109]Speck-tack-alar. \n[110]That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it. \n[111]Smart stuff. Super smart. \n[112]Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. \n[113]So what happens here? \n[114]I have no idea what that means, but you betcha. \n[115]Holy smokes! \n[116]You got inventory. \n[117]This is just sitting here? Talia! This is unproductive capital! Sell it on eBay. \n[118]What is all this worth? \n[119]Where? \n[120]53. \n[121]Denise. Larry. \n[122]This a good time? \n[123]I'll call you later. \n[124]Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal. \n[125]I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house. \n[126]I hoped not to, but I there it is. \n[127]I'm sorry. 56. \n[128]Let's start with six. \n[129]I don't have it. \n[130]I tried. I'm too much of a risk. \n[131]\n[132]Raul? Yes. \n[133]I do? \n[134]The USS Coral Sea. Boss, I don't want to quit school. \n[135]I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays. \n[136]Deal. When will we talk salary? \n[137]I'm sorry I'm late, Dr. Matsutani. May I still sit in the class? \n[138]Lala... To upload market differences without... \n[139]Then say it. Just give the answer. You know it. Say it. \n[140]I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow. 63. \n[141]Inappropriate subject in mixed company. \n[142]64. \n[143]She's marred. \n[144]Complimentary coffee is usually lousy. \n[145]I got a job. \n[146]Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school. \n[147]I was afraid of that. \n[148]You said come back in a few weeks. \n[149]I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I? \n[150]You guys are forced to say that, aren't you? \n[151]Should I begin? \n[152]first crossing of the Equator... \n[153]Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it... \n[154]Oh crap. \n[155]Raul's my boss, yeah. \n[156]Square footage at this price is a bargain. \n[157]This is your Matsutani Delta Number. You net this every month, you cover overhead, and the rest is profit. \n[158]Chapter four. 74. \n[159]Well, back to work! \n[160]Ms. Tainot? \n[161]Larry Crowne. \n[162]Do you need a ride? Hop on. \n[163]I was heading home. Right? We're done scooting? \n[164]Seriously. I offer you a ride. \n[165]I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case. \n[166]An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea. \n[167]In those shoes? \n[168]Put this on. Strap your legs round my engine and 80. \n[169]Ain't you a ball of fun? \n[170]I do want to survive this night. \n[171]Where am I taking you? \n[172]I may use this as a presentation in class. \n[173]I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could. \n[174]Someone's getting pinched... \n[175]Bad night for that guy. \n[176]Unit 114. \n[177]You don't want to give me your pass code. \n[178]This it? \n[179]I'll get the door for you 83. \n[180]What? \n[181]What? \n[182]What are you talking about? \n[183]When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony. \n[184]Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. \n[185]I assumed you preferred Ms 84. \n[186]That's a long story and it's late. My helmet? \n[187]\n[188]Thanks. \n[189]We all have crushes on you. Even the gals. \n[190]Wow... \n[191]Yes, you do.. In you go.  Close the door. Lock it! \n[192]Goodnight, whoever you are! \n[193]On his scooter. Heading towards the Scooter parking. She smiles -- a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it. She heads in that direction. \n[194]Epilog. School today. \n[195]If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. \n[196]How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. \n[197]Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can. \n[198]I wouldn't want that. \n[199]Sure. Nothing happened. At all. \n[200]None. \n[201]I'd better scurry along to Dr. Matsutani's class. I hope I don't have this same conversation with him. \n[202]I have to sell my car. 91. \n[203]If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it. \n[204]Half my UniMart salary. \n[205]I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days. \n[206]Everyone keeps saying that. \n[207]The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery. \n[208]This thing must be making me dizzy. What? \n[209]Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. \n[210]Why are you on the Register? 93. \n[211]Cash. No receipt. \n[212]'Consumerism'. \n[213]The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'. \n[214]You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final. \n[215]What? Why? \n[216]Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education. \n[217]98. \n[218]Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce. \n[219]It does. Soy sauce. Soy. Sauce. Quitting school is for dopes. \n[220]Might not make it. I have finals! \n[221]She's insane. \n[222]Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order? \n[223]Mrs. Tainot. \n[224]There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast. \n[225]You'll be the judge of that. \n[226]So, your meal is satisfactory? \n[227]Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job? \n[228]Shall I prepare you another batch? \n[229]Then I will return to my station.. \n[230]Priceless at a buck apiece. \n[231]You'll get me top price. \n[232]Here's lunch as promised! \n[233]108. \n[234]Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony. \n[235]Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough. \n[236]Ah. Forget it. Keep the change. \n[237]I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy. \n[238]Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot. \n[239]110. \n[240]This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity. \n[241]I'll have to see. \n[242]My first class in college ever. And I get an A. Gotta be the teacher. \n[243]Cars not much. Devices some. \n[244]In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. \n[245]Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. \n[246]How long was this broken? \n[247]All better now. Should be able to find your way. \n[248]My Boss. Back to work. Thanks for the good news... \n[249]Yes. \n[250]I met you. ", "MERCEDES TAINOT": "\n[1]I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! \n[2]Jerk! \n[3]Are you new to the Faculty? \n[4]This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars. \n[5]I bet it won't be the first time. \n[6]This is it? \n[7]...7, 8, 9. \n[8]My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning! This class...is CANCELLED!! \n[9]The city charter requires a minimum of ten students per class, otherwise it costs more to have us here than not. Did you really want a class at 8 AM? I didn't. Throw out those alarm clocks! \n[10]While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this 26. \n[11]Participate. Show up on time.  Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care.  My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. \n[12]Who are you? \n[13]Why are you here, Steve? \n[14]Busik. Of course... \n[15]32. \n[16]You'd think so. \n[17]Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise \n[18]Why wouldn't I believe you? \n[19]You were looking at porn. \n[20]Took you a while. \n[21]Yes you are. \n[22]Brain freeze. \n[23]I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate. \n[24]You look at Bra-Busters Triple-X expecting me to pretend I don't know or I don't care. I do both and don't like it. \n[25]We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you. Who's next? \n[26]Make me the bad guy. Ms. Crowne? \n[27]Mr. Crowne. My bad. \n[28]Go. \n[29]M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut. 38. \n[30]Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? \n[31]Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. But the speech is over. MERCEDES TAINOT Ah-ooo-gah! Time's up. \n[32]Breakfast may never be ready. \n[33]Next. \n[34]Are you clairvoyant? \n[35]Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. \n[36]White, Siler and Koss, you are up next time. You did good, Fran. Thanks. \n[37]Mr Crowne? Can you move along 50. \n[38]When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation? \n[39]Well I'm joking of course!!! \n[40]Go to hell... \n[41]It was. Yes. \n[42]How? \n[43]Okay. \n[44]Wait a ding dong minute.  1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class? \n[45]Where's Larry Crowne?! 60. \n[46]Anyone know why? \n[47]I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. \n[48]Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls. \n[49]Is that Larry Crowne!? You have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class! \n[50]Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. \n[51]Or the most recent. \n[52]I got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print... 67. \n[53]Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old. \n[54]Once more to Divorce Court to cashier a spouse, line my cloak with alimony and do myself homage. \n[55]Why can't all my students be like y u? \n[56]68. \n[57]And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a leash! \n[58]That's why he's in college! To get laid! \n[59]You are everything that's wrong with America, Larry Crowne! \n[60]\n[61]Youth wouldn't be the only requirement, of course. \n[62]A repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here... herself at you... No. Don't let up. No, Mercy. NO MERCY! 70. \n[63]Anyone recall anything from that? \n[64]That was a memorable nugget. \n[65]Mr. Koss to the lectern, please. \n[66]I'm smiling... \n[67]If they help, they help. \n[68]\"Chillax?\" Did you use the word \"chillax?\" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus? \n[69]You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me. \n[70]I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work. \n[71]Those weren't postings. They were comments. \n[72]\n[73]Drive, asshole! Drive away! \n[74]Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline! \n[75]LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER! \n[76]Oh, chillax!!! \n[77]I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! \n[78]The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! \n[79]I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. 78. \n[80]No. \n[81]Jesus Christ. \n[82]And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi? \n[83]What do men see in irritating free spirits? \n[84]Seriously. I don't want one. \n[85]I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major consequences sure to follow. You'll read about them on Parsectwelve.com. \n[86]I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it. \n[87]A man who notices shoes. All right. I'll be your Cycle Slut. \n[88]It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both. \n[89]Are you really going to go this slow? \n[90]Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is so slow a cat could knock us over. \n[91]Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop. \n[92]Try it and you'll flunk. 81. \n[93]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. \n[94]Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? \n[95]Hail our City's Finest. \n[96]Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive! Tiny dick loser! \n[97]Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff! \n[98]Thanks for the ox-cart ride. \n[99]I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working. Help me. \n[100]Just hold my hand up to the numbers. I'll manage from there. \n[101]Look away now. Two two two two. Pound. \n[102]W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. \n[103]Why I think it is! \n[104]Take one step inside and I call security. \n[105]And forget this ever happened. \n[106]This whole sorry chapter tonight. \n[107]You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me. \n[108]What, you have no short-term memory? \n[109]Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home. \n[110]Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that? \n[111]When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that. Why aren't you married? \n[112]Help yourself. \n[113]I noticed something on the ride. \n[114]\n[115]Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common. \n[116]You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still \n[117]My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. \n[118]Pretty dang good. I still got it, no? \n[119]Whoever I am... \n[120]Mr. Crowne? A moment please? \n[121]I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you. \n[122]Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span. \n[123]I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. \n[124]But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished. \n[125]happened before. \n[126]With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student. I hope the entire thing will be forgotten. \n[127]So there will be no bravado among you and your pals? \n[128]Thank you, Mr. Crowne. \n[129]Thanks for coming. \n[130]I knew you'd be on the computer. Working... \n[131]Are we making a mistake here? \n[132]Point made. We could change things. We could start right now. \n[133]Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure. \n[134]Really? \n[135]Okay. Now, you. \n[136]There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here. \n[137]I'm not saying that. 95. \n[138]Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid. Ms Pinedo Draw 96. \n[139]Spuds. Can't wait. \n[140]Who is that? \n[141]That's supposed to say 'Communism.' \n[142]Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. \n[143]No idea. Just pick another. \n[144]As long as alcohol's out of my grasp. \n[145]Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. \n[146]Yep. \n[147]I'll have the French Toast. \n[148]Breakfast all day. \n[149]You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter. \n[150]I kissed a boy. \n[151]One of my students. \n[152]Older than me. \n[153]He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice. \n[154]I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did. \n[155]102. \n[156]This is Larry Crowne. \n[157]It was fine, actually. I wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there. And say, howdy. Howdy doody. \n[158]Ready for the final? \n[159]Absolutely. \n[160]Yes indeed. \n[161]No. Thanks. 103. \n[162]Look at the men in my life. \n[163]That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor. \n[164]What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought. Dibiasi is nailing it. Calimeris stopped up-talking. Lala you can't shut up. Mack spoke about Australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice. And Larry Crowne... 105. \n[165]I was tough on him. But he learned fast.
