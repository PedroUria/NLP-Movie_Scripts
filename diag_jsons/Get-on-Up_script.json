Who been in there? \n[5]I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it? \n[6]I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was? \n[7]Something funny? \n[8]Then why you cats laughing? \n[9]OK listen up people. \n[10]Being it's Sunday and all I'm gone ask each of you to imagine you're sittin' in church right now. While today's sermon may be good they's something else on your mind. You realize you gotta take a shit. \n[11]Real bad. And you don't want to shit at the church house, naw sir. So you just sit there and think about getting home to your own toilet in your own master bath on Beech Island, South Carolina. I gotta a bidet in my master bath. Love my bidet. And a big pretty oval tub too. \n[12]You got a bidet, Sir? \n[13]You? \n[14]Well you gotta get you one. You all gotta get you a bidet. Are y'all sure its really Sunday today? \n[15]What was just saying... Oh, that's right. Yes! You gotta take shit. So, after church, you speed back home and you run like hell to the house scared you ain't gonna make it. But you do. Now imagine unhitching your pants as your open your bathroom door.

Which one of you gentlefolk hung a number two in my commode? \n[18]Was it you, Sir? Was it you?! \n[19]I ain't gone shoot nobody, son. \n[20]Ma'am, it was you wasn't it? You took a break in my bathroom, didn't you? \n[21]Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay. \n[22]You had to use the toilet. You saw an opportunity and you took it. Yeah, I got mad but, Lady, you did right by yourself. I've spent my whole life doing right by myself. I'm James Brown and I made a difference. \n[23]You cats may not own my records but you can bet every record you have got a piece of me in `em. Ain't nobody singing today that ain't been touched by James Brown. \n[24]So, Lady, you did right by yourself. And there ain't no other way to live. You understand me? \n[25]You understand me? \n[26]Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me. \n[27]Don't stop me. Don't stop me. \n[28]C'mon.

And please call me, Mr. Brown \n[69]How many times have I done this split Bobby? \n[70]Exactly, and now the first and only time I rip my pants has to be in front of all those white people. \n[71]My trumpet, bass, and drums are spread out all over this cold floor. \n[72]Go get my towel! \n[73]I'm seventeen... \n[74]Know what that means,   Big Junior? Means they can try me   in Superior Court. Means they can   send my juvenile ass down for   a man's term. 3 maybe 4 years. \n[75]You reach my daddy? \n[76]I know he's in the Army.

You know what I'm sayin'? \n[96]Thank you, Mrs Byrd. \n[97]No. He got a right to ask. I am a jailbird. I've done wrong and I gotta own up to that. \n[98]I stole a man's three piece suit. You want to know me? I tell ya. My daddy is in the army. My momma left when I was five. I'm skinny but I'm strong. I can read a little bit and I like to sing. That's who's sittin' here. \n[99]And I think God knew that when I took that suit that I might end up with you. I ain't never sat at a table with such a fine group of people in my life. \n[100]I used to wish I could put that suit back, but now I'm here with y'all. Fried chicken. Green beans. Corn bread. Those nice curtains. \n[101]A house smells good. I'm happy I stole that suit. And I thank you for having me here. \n[102]Junior. \n[103]Pretty girls. \n[104]Pretty girls. \n[105]What you talkin' about? Your hair is rising up to the Lord right?

Velma. \n[111]Oh, I'll still harmonize with Sarah from time to time. \n[112]Do all what? \n[113]I ain't startin' nothin', Bobby. Except what we doin'. \n[114]That us. We in there Bobby. \n[115]But, it is beautiful. All those little grooves. That's us. It's been written. \n[116]Now, men gone lay with women. That's nature. But a woman ain't never gone stop a real man from what he's supposed to do. That's God. Husband? Daddy? That gives a man purpose. Man gotta have purpose. But purpose don't stop me neither, Bobby. Ain't nothin' gone stop us. Nothin'. And that's God too. \n[117]You gone smile for me, Teddy Brown? \n[118]Come on, boy. \n[119]No baby. \n[120]Baby.

That's me. \n[133]Wait...wait a second here- \n[134]It ain't right. It's too slow.     We gotta pick up the pace fellas. \n[135]I need to come in early..push it. Drive it. Early. Before the beat. Then speed it up, man. \n[136]I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep. \n[137]But it ain't right. \n[138]Please!   Please!   Please. \n[139]Please!   Please!   Please! \n[140]Well thank you Sir, we worked real hard to- \n[141]I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear. \n[142]I see where we goin'. Saw it this morning when your secretary called ask me to come here an hour early. Alone. I knew it six months ago. Hell, I knew it the day I was born. \n[143]There's some things I'm gonna want. \n[144]Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good. \n[145]I think a live album- \n[146]But, Pop, you know my show. \n[147]Mr. Nathan, you ain't ever even seen the show. My show. \n[148]Mr. Nathan- \n[149]What are you doing? \n[150]That ain't the \"Mashed Potato\". \n[151]Book the Apollo. I'm gonna spend my own money on this. Syd Nathan's wrong. \n[152]Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it. \n[153]I don't understand risk? \n[154]I don't understand cos I'm just the \"show\"? Is that all I am to you, Pop? The show? The money? \n[155]Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the \"White Devil\". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all. \n[156]Pop, look me in the eye. \n[157]Pop. \n[158]Yeah, I'm the show. But, if I'm spendin' my own money on the show, then I'm gone be the business too. \n[159]And after we kill The Apollo, I'll kick over a few bucks to the white devil. Whatever I think he deserves. And If I'm payin' you, Pop, you gone show me how to do it. \n[160]And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers. \n[161]And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire. \n[162]It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold. \n[163]C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. \n[164]Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line. \n[165]You ready Mr. Byrd? \n[166]Watch me. \n[167]You know I feel alright. You know I feel alright children. I feel aaaaaaaallllriiiiiiight. \n[168]Think...Think...Think...About your bad self... \n[169]Thank you. That's very kind of you. \n[170]We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. \n[171]Momma? \n[172]Momma it's me. It's me. \n[173]This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur. \n[174]Gimme the keys. What they payin' you? \n[175]This here's a month's pay, help you get yourself another job. I gone drive myself. \n[176]Don't mention it. That's six a month goin' somewhere else. \n[177]Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you. \n[178]I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us. \n[179]-sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show. \n[180]I don't doubt it. \n[181]What if we took the gate? What if we took it ourself. \n[182]And still got the show promoted, but better. \n[183]Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations. \n[184]You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat. \n[185]The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say: \n[186]Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill. \n[187]And at the end he gone say.. \n[188]Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone. \n[189]He know the guy in the barber shop knows the guy at the pool hall, the guy at the garage. \n[190]That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate. \n[191]And the best part is, you can put it all through the books. Item. Promoter. What'd you think Pop? \n[192]Why not? \n[193]It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars. \n[194]And there's my next point Pop. Why not? \n[195]I can do something for you, and you can do something for me, and it ain't buy me no Cadillac. Did you buy Wilson Pickett a Cadillac? Did you buy Jackie Wilson a Cadillac? You know which way this thing is going Pop. I got people around me who don't see it. \n[196]Who you play Sax with son? \n[197]What's the rule? \n[198]Not on the bus. Not backstage. You a talented horn player, son. You gotta keep your game tight. Now you wanna smoke a little groove on your own time, that's yo' business. But we out here to work hard and we gone do just that you dig? Fifty. \n[199]Hello pretty thing. You want an autograph? \n[200]You want to come with me? So I can sign it somewhere private? \n[201]I called you yesterday, you ain't home. \n[202]You were home all day. So why you didn't pick up the phone? \n[203]I call you at one and quarter past one, then I call you at two. And I call again at three. \n[204]Where were you? \n[205]For two hours? \n[206]I ain't gone fine you, baby.

Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane? \n[212]You need anything? \n[213]Day off? \n[214]We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg? \n[215]Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg... \n[216]The Regal! \n[217]On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson. \n[218]Hey little man, you been good this year. \n[219]Merry Christmas, Little Man. \n[220]You stand up in James Brown's yard dressed like that?

You got something to say? \n[227]Well then you just HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL Mr. Byrd. \n[228]I can't have people HOLDING UP THE REHEARSAL. If I can't do it right I ain't gone do it at all. We got to GET ON. GET AHEAD. Now you know the rule. \n[229]You late, you off or you hold us up, it's no good, Mr. Byrd. Its gonna cost you 50 dollars. \n[230]Now are you ready Mr. Byrd.

You lost it at 7:05 PM Memphis time. \n[251]Now tomorrow night, you either got 10,000 angry folks in the Boston Garden, or you got 10,000 angry folks on your front lawn. Take your pick son. Which one you want? \n[252]Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together.

Hit that thing man. \n[258]In America today you've either got to be an entertainer or a ball player or what? If you poor, young and black, what is there? And you ask me why they on the street? It ain't politics we watchin'. It's economics. \n[259]You got kids out there that can't eat, robbing and stealing and doing what they have to do to make it. And if you don't do something about it we gonna lose the country. I go to Harlem, talk to Rap Brown, talk to the Nation they call me a separatist. Here we're on our way to the White House, Pop, and they already calling me an Uncle Tom. So what I supposed to do? \n[260]Write a check for Rap so he buy rifles, machine guns, rally on 125th and take it south?

You got to know where you are in this world. Five minutes ago, those boys were the best band on the planet. Now they nothing. Now they a bunch of sidemen with their hearts beatin' fast.

Well, I was told I'm closing the show. That's why I flew out here. \n[3]Y'all have a great show, fellas. \n[4]I ain't heard nothing since my radio got busted. That's a cool song bro'.

Like you said, Nafloyd, \"We just playin' around with \"Caldonia\". So let's go play around. \n[8]Ladies `n Gentlemen. Hope you're enjoying the show. \n[9]Just keepin' it warm for ya. \n[10]So how we catch the wind? \n[11]No. \n[12]It's that easy why don' you do it? \n[13]And why that. \n[14]You tell me Richard. You tell me what you see. \n[15]Nafloyd, you know in \"Let's Make It\" when it goes . If you go up there and hold it, like. . It's gone be sweet.

What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a \"new bag\". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you. \n[20]The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove. \n[21]I just did. See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it. \n[22]See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand? \n[23]Quit it. Clyde man. Lets get that POP! Dee.. app..POP! Unnerstand? It drop before you reach the beat. Dig? \n[24]Did I say change the part? Don't change the part. How many records you got? \n[25]But does it sound good? \n[26]Does it feel good? \n[27]Then it's musical. So play it like I say. From the top. \n[28]Mmmn! Huh! Now that a groove. \n[29]Tell the Mayor, I sold 30 million records and ninety five percent of them are to the black community. They listen to me. They won't riot \n[30]Don't look like it. \n[31]Come watch how Poppa don't take no mess. \n[32]Y'all act like y'all don't know what time it is. What you doin'? \n[33]Teddy, go on and wait outside. \n[34]I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna think about it. That's all. \n[35]Well go on. Get out of here. Y'might catch `em they gone need a singer. \n[36]How's that? \n[37]What the hell you talking about? \"Fill this place all myself\"? \"No problem?\" You sayin' I'm slippin'? \n[38]People copy me, Mr. Byrd. People gonna copy my moves till the earth goes dark. You understand? You think people are gonna buy that record like they buy my record? That what you sayin'? \n[39]Who you been tellin' this too? You been telling that to the Apollo? \n[40]Bobby, how you gone stand on your own feet? You just spent twenty years gettin' fat on a man's dollar. I produce a record for you and now it's gone to your head. You go talking big behind my back. You go sneaking round, raising heat off another man's name. We here, we doing something and you making plans sucker? \n[41]Damn right you can't do this no more. \n[42]See, the funny part. You say that like it's a big thing. Like \"oh my God, Bobby Byrd gone leave James Brown on his own.\" \n[43]How we doin, Gertrude? \n[44]That's good. You two gimme a minute here. ", "MACEO": "\n[1]Please, Lord! Please! \n[2]Oh. My. God. \n[3]No shit, Mr. Brown. \n[4]Who's this? \n[5]Which seat. Her's or the bus? \n[6]Mean I give it some heat. \n[7]What about when he do this..? \n[8]You're kidding. Tell me you kidding. \n[9]Your Chinese knees Mr. Brown. \n[10]No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling. \n[11]Does he mean top of the bar? \n[12]But Mr. Brown. \n[13]We rehearsed it like you told us. We got it like you like it. Jimmy can't do that with the part he's playing. We can change the part if you want. \n[14]Guitar, Mr. Brown. \n[15]But Mr. Brown. \n[16]Clyde'll be in a different time to the rest of the band. That doesn't work musically. \n[17]Bobby, James Brown's my meal ticket. So I just shut my ears and chomp down his bullshit. But why you soak it up man? You his best friend. You know him for time brother. And he treat you like that. I was you I'd bust him in his damn mouth. \n[18]You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front? \n[19]You think they fuck up he gone take they pocket money. \n[20]I've been elected spokesman to speak on behalf of the band. \n[21]We asked to get paid on time. We haven't been paid in weeks. We asked for scheduled days off. Every day off we get you make us rehearse.. We asked to get paid for recording but you included it in our salary. \n[22]We know you owe the government back taxes. Your restaurant, radio stations, recording studios, labels, all different businesses, Unaccounted cash passing between them. \n[23]It's a mess, Mr. Brown and if you want us to be a part of it, we gonna need our cash too. Right now. \n[24]And most of all none of us ever want to be fined for anything ever again. ", "BEN BART": "\n[1]I need to speak to James. \n[2]Gertrude, it's important. \n[3]James, I just spoke to the producers. They've requested the Rolling Stones close the show. \n[4]Rolling Stones, James. You'll go on right before them. It'll be you, then the Rolling Stones top of the bill. \n[5]You're here because they want you here, James. You're James Brown! I want you here. Because this isn't the chitlin' circuit man. We're done with that shit. This is an audience full of white faces and you're gonna make them love you. You're just not closing the show. \n[6]James. Now don't start. Let it go. \n[7]They're just kids. In a year from now we won't even know who they are. It's business, James. \n[8]James, don't... \n[9]Yes Sir, Mr. Brown. \n[10]Come in Boys. Come in. \n[11]Boys, I have something to show you. \n[12]We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home. \n[13]James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts \"Blow it fucker!\" in the middle of The Magic Flute. \n[14]I'm not going to let you do that, Jimmy. \n[15]Forget it, Jimmy. It's too big of a risk. Let's order something to eat. \n[16]Of course not, Jimmy. \n[17]I'm not the \"White Devil\". I'm trying to protect you. I'm doing my job. \n[18]I'll call Nola Sound. They got these new three track stereo recorders from Ampex. \n[19]We'll need the band in New York immediately. \n[20]Sapphire Blue. Underwear too. How does that sound? \n[21]I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane. \n[22]Better than Lenny Franks? \n[23]I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss. ", "BOBBY BYRD": "\n[1]We the Gospel Starlighters, from right here in Toccoa. Three Four.. \n[2]Crowd sure went crazy. You like music? \n[3]Look at these people James. Man! I'm ready. You know'm saying? When it gone be us up there? \n[4]What? \n[5]James ain't saying that `floyd. He's just hearing something. Get back to pushing the car. \n[6]What I say in Peterstown? Huh? \n[7]What I say? \n[8]So, push the Wagon, Nafloyd. \n[9]Ready Mr. Brown. \n[10]They're closed, Dede. \n[11]Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa. That's where we met. \n[12]Well there was five of us to start with. Nafloyd Scott, Baby Roy Scott, Sylvester Keels.. \n[13]Yeah. They left. \n[14]James- \n[15]Yes, Mr. Brown. \n[16]I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front. \n[17]You work so hard at this one thing and then one day you realize it ain't supposed to be you. You can get mad. Try to fight it but if it's God's truth. It's God's truth. James is supposed to be in front. I saw it happen. And the man in front has to BE the man in front. It ain't always pretty but that's the man's responsibility if he wanna stay there. And you and me can't know what that is. We ain't supposed to. So, don't lie to yourself Maceo. Every man in this band walks taller because he with James Brown. Every man in this band believe in himself a little more because he's with James Brown. \n[18]No. But my ears a' open. Open your ears, Maceo. He's a genius. And he's takin' us with him. \n[19]It's King. They shot Dr. King. \n[20]No I don't think you slippin'.   You James Brown. You ain't never slippin'.

Do you know what you want James? \n[4]Compliments of Universal Attractions. \n[5]What's that Jimmy. \n[6]Just standard Jimmy. Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales. Lets plan a- \n[7]Well let me explain the way it works. When you book a show. Take Chicago. Now our promoter in Chicago is- \n[8]Lenny J Frank. Lenny's the number one promoter in Chicago has been for twenty years. \n[9]Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate, we can account. You know, number one, you're getting top rate and number two- \n[10]Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because... \n[11]Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it. \n[12]Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show. \n[13]And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown. \n[14]Po-lice have the same problem. \n[15]Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after. \n[16]Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses. \n[17]Jimmy, Mayor of Boston's office called. Wanted you to know they've cancelled tomorrow's show at the Garden. For reasons of public safety. He's worried about rioting. \n[18]We have virtual race war looming across the South, Jimmy. Politics, 101? Don't put 10,000 angry blacks together in one place in the middle of a city, and broadcast it live to the world. \n[19]It says you kissin' up to the Man James. \n[20]No. I'm saying who gives a shit. You're already screwed, James. Think about it.   If you stand up Lyndon Johnson to go kiss up to the Panthers, you ain't gone be playin' Vegas anytime soon because if they think you can stop a riot, they sure as hell will expect you to start one. \n[21]Don't be scared my friend. Because if you're scared, it doesn't end well for the black man. Do your thing, James. It's worked for you so far. ", "SUSIE": "\n[1]You can't catch me! \n[2]I gotcha! \n[3]You ain't hungry baby.
