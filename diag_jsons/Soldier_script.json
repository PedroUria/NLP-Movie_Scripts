Knife scars, bullet scars, burns. \n[4]There are words on his shoulder. Tannhauser Gate, the Argentine Sector, Montana, Bolivia, Shanghai 2012... \n[5]We'll have to sleep on the floor. \n[6]I won't permit danger to Nathan. \n[7]You must be...you must be feeling better. \n[8]He's late learning.  He was sick for a long time. \n[9]This way... \n[10]You have to watch out for them. They probably wouldn't kill someone your size, not if you were healthy anyway.  But they'd make you pretty sick.  Someone smaller...like me, or a child... \n[11]In a month this one will be as big as those. \n[12]Here.  You try one. \n[13]...And it got worse and worse.  My father hadn't had any work in three months and...also...there were other things...violence...  political feelings.  My father said he'd heard it was better in the Trinity moons. A lot of other people must have had the same idea because the ship was jammed with people...mostly families.  That's probably why it broke down...  overloaded. \n[14]Even after they made the repairs, it barely got off the ground, it was an old converted mining transport, a piece of junk to start with.  It just...dropped.  Maybe you saw what's left of it...out there in the wind.  A lot of people died.  And we couldn't make any radio contact... So we were stuck here.  Nobody was happy about it.  A few years later, when the dumpers started coming over and dropping stuff, people tried to get their attention with explosions and fires.  But it didn't work. They must be unmanned...or they just don't care.  Maybe they think we're garbage too! \n[15]So there really wasn't any choice. People had to pull together and make the best of it.  We became a... community. \n[16]One good thing...nobody bothers us. Who'd want to fight over a godforsaken place like this? \n[17]I guess that's what you like!  The fighting, I mean.  The wars. You must...you're a soldier... \n[18]We'll eat these. \n[19]It seemed like he was never going to walk.  Then all of a sudden...he's an expert. \n[20]Well, not quite an expert. \n[21]Sergeant Todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier? \n[22]What do you think about? \n[23]Do you think about food?  Or women? You must think about something. \n[24]What about feelings then?  You must have feelings.  You must feel something. \n[25]Fear!  You mean...you feel afraid? That's when you're in battle... What about other times?  Now, for example? \n[26]Now? \n[27]You don't...look afraid.  You look fearless. \n[28]Oh, my God.  But there's nothing to be afraid of here.  I can't hurt you.  I wouldn't. \n[29]It's beautiful, Jimmy.  He'll love it. \n[30]You should give it to him yourself. I think he's in the meeting room... doing...exercises. \n[31]He's not fully recovered. \n[32]I know. \n[33]Are you afraid of him, Mace? \n[34]He told me he's afraid. \n[35]What happened? \n[36]And if you're ever sick...or you get hurt... \n[37]Mace!  What about the vote? Everybody voted. \n[38]What's going on? \n[39]Keep going, children, don't panic, don't panic. \n[40]Into the bedroom, all of you. \n[41]Sergeant Todd! \n[42]Nathan, thank God, there you... \n[43]Did he find you? \n[44]My husband...Mace...he went out to look for you.  He...found you, didn't he? \n[45]They...killed him...didn't they? \n[46]Your wound...it's still bleeding. \n[47]It doesn't...hurt? \n[48]How do you know they'll come back? \n[49]What...what do they want? \n[50]Nothing? \n[51]You know who they are, don't you? Do you know how many there'll be? \n[52]Seventeen!  My God! You can't fight seventeen yourself! You have to organize the rest of us, show us what to do.  We don't have your...your skills...but we're not cowards.  We'll do what you tell us, we'll -- \n[53]Why not? \n[54]But...one soldier against seventeen! \n[55]Sergeant!  Sergeant Todd! \n[56]Sergeant...these soldiers...the ones you're going to fight...

No matter what happens! \n[67]Ellen, go to the Commons.  Tell Jimmy Pig and Mr. Slade that Sergeant Todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root-cellar.  Can you do that? \n[68]It's all right.  The soldiers are gone for now.  But be careful where you walk.  And if it's too smoky, just come back. \n[69]Tell them to bring all the food and clothing they can carry. Do you all understand that Sergeant Todd here is going to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he was your father or your mother. \n[70]No... but he's our friend.  Our good friend.  Do you understand? \n[71]No.  No, he can't do that, but -- \n[72]Sergeant Todd! \n[73]\n[74]Sergeant... \n[75]Nathan!

Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying... \n[5]...He used to say, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" \n[6]Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these \"hot shots\" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They are battle-tested, aren't they? \n[7]The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence... \n[8]Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new... \n[9]What about endurance? \n[10]Our man has been out there fifteen minutes now.  Shouldn't you send one? \n[11]What's the price of all that speed? Is he tired? \n[12]Todd here ran the pace he's been taught to run.  He's still strong. Send him up the chain, Rube. \n[13]What about...spirit? \n[14]Whatever the latest jargon is. \n[15]At ease, Lieutenant. What if they fought? \n[16]Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. \n[17]\"No\"? \n[18]Mmmmmmm... \n[19]Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. \"Training accident.\"  Paperwork. \n[20]Incinerator. \n[21]They're very...impressive. \n[22]It was our best man who got his eye...  Todd, a real tough one. Survived police action in Montana, fought in the Argentine Sector, and in the Saudi Campaign to say nothing of -- \n[23]We got it all right.  This is an outpost here, not the Third Army! You've got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and -- \n[24]What if we do run into people... say squatters or refugees? \n[25]Eliminate them, you mean. \n[26]Down there...is it snowing? \n[27]We brought you a little Christmas tree. \n[28]Christ, I wish we were on Earth. \n[29]Sloan's already on it. \n[30]Next one's going to be a real pain in the ass. \n[31]How about a \"gaseous currents\" and \"urgent convections\" pain in the ass. \n[32]It's a dump.  Literally. \n[33]The Crawlers are low enough and heavy enough, they won't blow.  The men should wear armored vests and carry double weapons and ammo for the weight.  They may have to use lines too, like mountain climbers. \n[34]\"People\"!  \"People\"?  What do you mean \"people\"? \n[35]Damn! Did they ask for assistance? \n[36]Like my daddy used to say, \"Nothing's ever as simple as it's supposed to be...except shit.\" \n[37]Good point. \n[38]There's resistance? \n[39]Humph.  Sounds reckless, three against fifty.  The old ones, the veterans, they would have called for support...just in case. \n[40]A \"growl\"!  He heard a growl? \n[41]My God!  Who are we fighting here! \n[42]I knew Mekum's hotshots were green. No reinforcements, then they walk right into an enemy stronghold. \n[43]Absolutely not.  Those bastards are just waiting in there for us.  No more of this fancy super-soldier shit.  We do it with the hammer... \n[44]My daddy always said, \"When you want to insert a nail in a piece of wood, you don't do nothing fancy or glamorous, you don't finesse or play the hero, you just pick up your damn hammer and hit that sumbitch till it's in.\" \n[45]Take the whole unit, both Crawlers, and tell 'em to pound that place with rockets, cannons, mortars, everything we got...from a safe distance. \n[46]It may not be heroic, and we may waste some ammo, but by God we'll get the job done. \n[47]Whaaaaat? \n[48]What about Number One?  Try Number... \n[49]You should have waked me sooner! This is bad, very bad.  I never should have let that clown Mekum test his wonder boy army on me.  \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Shit!  We don't even know what we're up against.  How many...? \n[50]We're sitting ducks here!  There could be a couple of divisions! More!  We don't even have the weapons to arm the old soldiers. \n[51]Not only are we apparently out twenty of your fancy new soldiers, your supermen, we're out both crawlers and all the weapons...so we can't arm the old soldiers, the ones you \"improved\" on, to defend ourselves... \n[52]Well, how's it gonna look when we lose the ship too?  How's that gonna look on the old record?  'Cause that's what's gonna happen if we don't get our ass outta here.  We can't defend ourselves with no weapons and -- \n[53]Good plan, Colonel. \n[54]Meaning? \n[55]Doesn't matter.  For once Mekum's on the ball. This is a very dirty bomb!  That wind will churn the radioactivity around like soap in a washing machine.  This is gonna be one clean place in a very short time... \n[56]\n[57]Right horizontal? \n[58]All right we're \"go.\"  I'm allowing us three minutes to clear the atmosphere and get out of range. That means we can wait seven more minutes. \n[59]I guess they wouldn't want to get old anyway. Go ahead, lock the hatch. Rube, punch up the port power cluster and -- \n[60]Huh?  What was what? \n[61]I'm your superior officer, don't you understand that? \n[62]Don't you realize you're violating the chain of command?  I'm giving you a direct order to...to...to... \n[63]S-sergeant?  S-sergeant T-todd? It...  You...!  How...?  How...? \n[64]We have to get out of here!  All of us!  You need us!

Fall away. \n[5]Thirty seconds, 90 percent hits. \n[6]Ninety-nine percent... \n[7]That's...very good. \n[8]What are we supposed to do with the old soldiers? \n[9]At ease, soldier. \n[10]Soldier!

Atmosphere pain in the ass? \n[22]Wind! \n[23]Will the wind affect the patrol? \n[24]People.  They've spotted people! \n[25]Two civilians.  Unarmed.  They've killed both of them.  They've spotted smoke from some kind of camp and they're going to check it out. \n[26]Not yet. \n[27]Who do you think they are? \n[28]Report from Crawler One.  Everything under control.  No need for assistance. \n[29]Ineffectual.  About fifty disorganized people with almost no fire power.  Three men are going in to clean them out; one man's staying with the Crawler. \n[30]Well, he didn't say the word \"growl.\"  He said a \"throat-noise,\" but I asked him to imitate it and it sounded like a growl to me. \n[31]I think...I think we have to assume the missing men are...down. \n[32]We could send reinforcements now... \n[33]Uh, what does that mean, \"the hammer\"? \n[34]I...don't...quite...follow...sir. \n[35]Raw firepower! \n[36]This is Daddy, come in, Number Two.

That's not what we mean by \"hunting.\" Jimmy Pig, you're not going to shoot anything, are you? \n[17]It's how we call for help.  Two shots.  There'll be someone on duty, listening in case we get off the wire and get lost or something.  We have flares too.  Come on. \n[18]Sandra said she told you how we wound up here.
