They had parents, they embraced their humanity... they didn't hide it... fight it... question it! \n[106]Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much... \n[107]Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority.

Not as a Judge but... but... as my friend? ::'s the most ordinary request anyone could make... anyone but Dredd. Hershey understands how much it means.

When Lily Hammond says \"Dredd\", it's part of the conversation. And when Vardis Hammond,,sa s 'Dredd' it could just as easily be the same.

Griffin bangs the gavel for silence. THE DEFENSE TABLE 1r Hershey returns here to get another document. Dredd WHISPERS. \n[26]You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else. \n[27]It clearly shows nothing!

He does his best to look cool. \n[28]all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case.  I ask for a ruling. \n[29]Trust me.

What are you doing here? \n[54]Dredd! '_- a moment she's elated. Then her face hardens. She holds n steady. \n[55]Stay where you are. \n[56]They're dying out-there, Dredd. A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours. Everyone who's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin. I thought it was organized criminals, revolutionaries, something... then I was a target. \n[57]I don't know what to think anymore. Dredd moves like lightning - pins her gun hand against the wall - then freezes. It's a challenge, not a threat. She glares at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's deliberate check-mate on both their parts. \n[58]Secrets can hurt more than anything. She relaxes her hold on him. Throws something down. \n[59]Tell me about him, Dredd. Make me believe in you again the way I did when I defended you. \n[60]And he's doing it again? \n[61]Griffin? We have to tell the Council - ! \n[62]Clones. Clones, from a genetic laboratory.  I guess I wasn't so bad in court after all. That's why the DNA convicted you.

Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment. \n[67]I'd be honored. Dredd reaches over, squeezes her hand. There's absolutely nc:n.nc sexual about it - and that makes it even more powerful. \n[68]Central. This is Judge Hershey.

Let him see what it's like I to be me! After all... He moves closer to Griffin, smiles. \n[16].Dredd and I have so much in common. Why not this? Griffin looks at him, decides to drop the subject. \n[17]Yes. The Janus lab - \n[18]Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can handle that. After all...  Look how quickly I brought fear in here. His smile fades and he exits. \n[19]Hello, Professor. \n[20]I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul. \n[21]Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do.

", "CENTRAL": "\n[1]One moment. ,_u OMITTED thru \n[2]Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One. The difference lies in two areas: The computer chip and the ammunition coding. Like the Model one, the computer chip recognizes the thumbcode of all Judges. Judges may use each other's firearms; but a suspect dare not use a Judge's .weapon against \"a Judge. ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion. \n[3]However, the ammunition coding in the Model Two is not cued to the thumbcode recognition chip. Instead, it is coded to the personal DNA of the Judge using the weapon. \n[4]Yes, Judge McGruder. It could not be otherwise. \n[5]The DNA is a perfect match for Judge Joseph--D-re--dd. \n[6]That could take several days, Judge Hershey. The Graphic Database covers all known graphics, from the Paleoithic Era to today. Hershey opens the framed viewies she took from Dredd's apartment, slides out the one with the adult Dredd. \n[7]\n[8]\n[9]I'm sorry, I can neither confirm nor deny your statement. \n[10]Acknowledged. \n[11]Acknowledged.

May I suggest you Pardon him, and then appoint him? That would meet the legal requirements. \n[17]It's done. Council Judge Rico, may be the first to offer my congratulations? \n[18]DNA sample purged.

Chief Justice Griffin promoted him so they could both use me to get the Janus Lab up and running. \n[23]Lawyers. \n[24]Now, we've already been over that one: You're not a Judge anymore and you can't file charges. Flash of inspiration. Dredd excitedly signals Hershey. \n[25]Certainly, Judge Hershey. However, as per Mega-City Code Section 84, Paragraph \"A\", I need authorization from the Chief Justice to arrest a Council Judge. Similarly, as stated in Paragraph \"B\", same Section, I need authorization from any Council Judges to arrest a Chief Justice. In this case, that would be Chief Judge Griffin and Council Judge Rico. \n[26]Basically... yes. And without their authorization you cannot file charges, and without charges I cannot violate Security and tell you the location of the Lab. \n[27]I hope this is finally clear.. If there aren't any other requests, may I close this work station? These last few days have been a strain and I really need to defrag. The work station SHUTS DOWN. Dredd turns. \n[28]It's probably just the Judge Hunters. \n[29]When I was off-line a moment ago, Judge Griffin asked me if I knew where you were. Naturally, I told him yes, and gave him your location. \n[30]I'm sorry, Chief Justice. The ABC robot is not tied into my main processor. Judge Rico has sole voice control. \n[31]Before we go on, um... may I assume that Judge Griffin has uh... retired from duty? \n[32]The clone incubators are on-line. The first batch of clones from your personal DNA can be hatched in eight hours. Chief Justice Rico, how many copies of you would you like? \n[33]The cloning process is not finished, Chief Justice Rico. The Clones will be only 60 per cent complete. \n[34]Beginning hatching process... now. I know we're going to regret this. \n[35]Don't expect help from me, escaped-convict Dredd. I have explained your legal standing repeatedly. I advise you to surrender. \n[36]Oh, he went upstairs. The lights come ON. \n[37]Straight ahead to your right. Dredd's gone.
