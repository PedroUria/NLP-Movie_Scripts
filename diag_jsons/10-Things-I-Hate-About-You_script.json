Not exactly a crucial topic. \n[5]Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of cats. \n[6]I guess the school board thinks because Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's worthy of our time \n[7]What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte? Simone de Beauvoir? \n[8]Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action. \n[9]I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator. \n[10]Tempestuous? \n[11]As always, thank you for your excellent guidance. \n[12]The fact that you're cutting gym so you can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear his name, is a little without in itself if you ask me. \n[13]Patrick Verona   Random skid. \n[14]I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting. \n[15]Block E? \n[16]Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. \n[17]What's this? \n[18]I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. \n[19]Okay, say you do it.  You kill yourself, you end up in wherever you end up and he's there.  Do you really think he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound compulsive who failed volleyball? \n[20]Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break. \n[21]The people at this school are so incredibly foul. \n[22]Remove head from sphincter!  Then pedal! \n[23]\"Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --\" \n[24]Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty. \n[25]Where've you been? \n[26]How touching. \n[27]I guess I got in \n[28]I know. \n[29]You decided. \n[30]Ask Bianca who drove her home \n[31]This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? \n[32]So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. \n[33]William didn't even go to high school \n[34]Neither has his heterosexuality. \n[35]I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind? \n[36]If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara.\" \n[37]Janice Parker is an idiot \n[38]Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? \n[39]My mission in life. \n[40]Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked.  The world makes sense again. \n[41]Oh, right.  Friday. \n[42]Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? \n[43]Doubtful.  Very doubtful. \n[44]I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. \n[45]I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion. \n[46]And why would I do that? \n[47]You -- covered in my vomit. \n[48]Are you following me? \n[49]Hi \n[50]Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy. \n[51]Hey -- do you mind? \n[52]Then tell them I had a seizure. \n[53]I thought you were punishing me. \n[54]Because you're making decisions for me. \n[55]So what I want doesn't matter? \n[56]I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want -- \n[57]It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going. \n[58]What do you think? \n[59]Let's hit it. \n[60]No fear. \n[61]Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss! \n[62]I need agua! \n[63]Shit \n[64]Two waters. \n[65]You're not fooling anyone. \n[66]If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it over with.  \n[67]That's what you want, isn't it? \n[68]You're not surrounded by your usual cloud of smoke. \n[69]Oh, really? \n[70]You know who The Raincoats are? \n[71]What? \n[72]Who cares? \n[73]Gigglepuss was so beyond. \n[74]So true. \n[75]What's normal? \n[76]At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig. \n[77]It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him? \n[78]I know about the goddamn party.  I'm going. \n[79]Can we go now? \n[80]I'm driving. \n[81]Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede? \n[82]Away. \n[83]Leave my sister alone. \n[84]\n[85]\"I'm getting trashed, man.\" Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party? \n[86]Funny, you're the only one \n[87]Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- \n[88]I want another one \n[89]I'm fine. I'm \n[90]I just need to lie down for awhile \n[91]I know, just let me sleep \n[92]Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, okay? \n[93]This is so patronizing. \n[94]Why 're you doing this? \n[95]You don't care if I die \n[96]Why? \n[97]Like you could find one \n[98]Just let me sit down. \n[99]Who? \n[100]I hate him. \n[101]Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be \"cool\"?  You don't think I can be \"laid back\" like everyone else? \n[102]You know what they say \n[103]What? \n[104]Go away \n[105]You're welcome. \n[106]It's my car. \n[107]But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there. \n[108]When you were gone last year -- where were you? \n[109]Were you in jail? \n[110]No, you weren't \n[111]Why'd you lie? \n[112]I should do this. \n[113]This. \n[114]My father wouldn't approve of that that \n[115]Oh, so now you think you know me? \n[116]The only thing people know about me is that I'm \"scary\". \n[117]He just wants me to be someone I'm not. \n[118]\n[119]You know -- you're not as vile as I thought you were. \n[120]I didn't have a choice. \n[121]I did Bianca a favor and it backfired. \n[122]I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun. \n[123]Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess? \n[124]Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica. \n[125]You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement. \n[126]What are you doing here? \n[127]You 're so -- \n[128]Unwelcome. \n[129]Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties. \n[130]Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing. \n[131]Excuse me, Mr. Chapin? \n[132]Sir, I'd like to state for the record that Mr. Verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary.  I never filed a complaint. \n[133]But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention.  There are far more hideous acts than off-key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis. \n[134]Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something I've always wanted to show you. \n[135]These. \n[136]Thank you, Mr. Chapin. \n[137]He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. \n[138]C'mon.  It's not that bad \n[139]Put your right foot there -- \n[140]You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? \n[141]You shit! \n[142]The Partridge Family? \n[143]Good call. \n[144]I dazzled him with my wit \n[145]Yeah, well, don't let it get out \n[146]Acting the way we do. \n[147]I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. \n[148]Something like that \n[149]How? \n[150]For. . . ? \n[151]Damn it! \n[152]State trooper? \n[153]The duck? \n[154]I know the porn career's a lie. \n[155]Tell me something true. \n[156]No -- something real.  Something no one else knows. \n[157]What? \n[158]You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that? \n[159]Is that a request or a command? \n[160]No. \n[161]No, I won't go with you \n[162]Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition. \n[163]Why are you doing this? \n[164]All of it -- what's in it for you? \n[165]Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What? \n[166]You tell me. \n[167]Answer the question, Patrick \n[168]Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School. \n[169]I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s . \n[170]Joey never told you we went out, did he? \n[171]In 9th.  For a month \n[172]He was, like, a total babe \n[173]Now I do.  Back then, was a different story. \n[174]He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it. \n[175]Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me. \n[176]After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because \"everyone else\" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display -- \n[177]I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him. \n[178]That's not \n[179]I guess I thought I was protecting you. \n[180]Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to. \n[181]Feel like shopping? \n[182]Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See you in a few. \n[183]How'd you get a tux at the last minute? \n[184]It's just something I had.  You know \n[185]Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong. \n[186]are you ready? \n[187]C'mon.  Let's get this over with. \n[188]Quite the ostentatious display \n[189]Who? \n[190]Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations. \n[191]What? \n[192]That ' s completely adorable! \n[193]You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up! \n[194]Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me? \n[195]You are so not what I thought you were. \n[196]I ' m sure . \n[197]So did you \n[198]Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm. \n[199]No, Daddy. \n[200]Parts of it. \n[201]The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy. \n[202]What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her? \n[203]When I go? \n[204]For what? \n[205]Family emergency. \n[206]You set me up. \n[207]What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What? \n[208]Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it? \n[209]It's just you. \n[210]I'11 go \n[211]I hate the way you talk to me/ and the way you cut your hair/ I hate the way you drive my car/ I hate it when you stare. \n[212]I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and the way you read my mind/ I hate you so much it makes me sick/ it even makes me rhyme. \n[213]I hate the way you're always right/ I hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you make me laugh/ even worse when you make me cry/ I hate it that you're not around/ and the fact that you didn't call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' t hate you/ not even close, not even a little bit, not even any at all. \n[214]A Fender Strat. You bought this? \n[215]Is that right? \n[216]You can't just buy me a guitar every time you screw up, you know. \n[217]And don't just think you can \n[218]Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill? \n[219]Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook? \n[220]You're freaked over this, aren't you? \n[221]I'd like to call your attention to Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look of 1995 --- \n[222]Perm? ", "PATRICK": "\n[1]I missed you. \n[2]It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch. \n[3]Mother Goose? \n[4]Touch of the flu. \n[5]How 'bout your sex life? \n[6]What's to discuss? \n[7]Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... \n[8]What? \n[9]Yeah \n[10]Two legs, nice rack... \n[11]Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it. \n[12]You need money to take a girl out \n[13]Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had the plane. \n[14]You're gonna pay me to take out some girl? \n[15]How much? \n[16]I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. \n[17]Fifty, and you've got your man. \n[18]Hey. Girlie. \n[19]I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? \n[20]There's a way to get a guy's attention. \n[21]Pick you up Friday, then \n[22]The night I take you to places you've never been before.

Vintage fenders. \n[31]I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi. \n[32]You're not a big talker, are you? \n[33]I'm on it \n[34]I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. \n[35]I just upped my price \n[36]A hundred bucks a date. \n[37]Forget her sister, then. \n[38]Say it \n[39]Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say. \n[40]What plan? \n[41]What is it with this chick?

You see a couple of minors come in? \n[59]Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? \n[60]hey.  Great show, huh? \n[61]Excuse me? \n[62]Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me. \n[63]I know.  I quit. \n[64]You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there. \n[65]Why, don't you? \n[66]I watched you out there   I've never seen you look like that \n[67]Come to that party with me. \n[68]I got it, Rick. \n[69]Nine-thirty then. \n[70]See you next week! \n[71]Nine-thirty right? \n[72]I'm early. \n[73]Who knocked up your sister? \n[74]What's this? \n[75]I say, do what you wanna do. \n[76]Maybe you should let me have it.  Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go  \n[77]It's about time. \n[78]Do what? \n[79]Okay? \n[80]You're not okay. \n[81]Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep \n[82]What if you have a concussion?

I'm stayin'. \n[146]Maybe. \n[147]I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off. \n[148]So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? \n[149]A soft side? Who knew? \n[150]So what's your excuse? \n[151]Yes \n[152]So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? \n[153]Then you screwed up \n[154]You never disappointed me. \n[155]You up for it? \n[156]Fallacy. \n[157]Hearsay. \n[158]Do you? \n[159]I hate peas. \n[160]You're sweet.

She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story. \n[177]It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? \n[178]Wait I... \n[179]It wasn't like that. \n[180]I didn't care about the money. \n[181]I cared about -- \n[182]I thought you could use it. When you start your band. \n[183]Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. \n[184]Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her. \n[185]You know -- it's not every day you find a girl who'll flash her tits to get you out of detention. \n[186]I know \n[187]Because I like to torture you. \n[188]Don ' t you even dare. . . \n[189]She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca now hands her.  \n[190]Ask my attorney.

Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask... \n[7]What if she never starts dating? \n[8]But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy! \n[9]But she doesn't want to date. \n[10]Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again. \n[11]Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.  \n[12]You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again? \n[13]No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- \n[14]The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does. \n[15]The problem is, she's completely anti-social.  \n[16]Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. \n[17]Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... \n[18]C'esc ma tete. This is my head \n[19]I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone. \n[20]Forget French. \n[21]How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing? \n[22]Show me \n[23]Give me a sign when he walks by.  And don't point. \n[24]Where? \n[25]My God, he's repulsive. He's so perfect! \n[26]Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility. \n[27]Can you at least start wearing a bra? \n[28]A \"copine\" is someone you can count on. An \"ami\" is someone who makes promises he can't keep. \n[29]I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing.

Not unless my sister goes. \n[38]Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. \n[39]Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes. \n[40]Can you turn down the Screaming Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study. \n[41]Don't tell me you're actually going out?  On a school night, no less. \n[42]Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal? \n[43]Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night? \n[44]I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck. \n[45]She's obviously not going. \n[46]Daddy, I -- \n[47]If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends. \n[48]It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since \"Gloria Steinem\" over there isn't going -- \n[49]Daddy, people expect me to be there! \n[50]You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal. \n[51]Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that. \n[52]Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched? \n[53]Like I'm supposed to know what that even means. \n[54]Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too. \n[55]It's just a party. Daddy. \n[56]Daddy, no! \n[57]You are so completely unbalanced. \n[58]Why? \n[59]Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat  A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts another.  \n[60]Where did he go?  He was just here. \n[61]Joey. \n[62]Hi. \n[63]You know Chastity? \n[64]Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron? \n[65]Surprise me. \n[66]Queen Harry? \n[67]Neat... \n[68]I'll be right back. \n[69]He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation. \n[70]Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman... \n[71]Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know? \n[72]I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now. \n[73]Dinner taste better on the way out? \n[74]I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here. \n[75]I have to be home in twenty minutes. \n[76]Tons \n[77]Cameron? \n[78]Do you think you could give me a ride home? \n[79]\n[80]I was? \n[81]Well, no... \n[82]But \n[83]Hi, Joey. \n[84]You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go -- \n[85]Since when? \n[86]Quick question -- are you going to the prom? \n[87]Then Guillermo says, \"If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210.\" \n[88]do you listen to this crap? \n[89]Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself. \n[90]What good stuff? \n[91]Like my fear of wearing pastels? \n[92]I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this \"persona\"?  And you don't know how to quit? \n[93]Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie. \n[94]Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night -- \n[95]No, but \n[96]He's not a \"hot rod\".  Whatever that is. \n[97]Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession! \n[98]Come in.  Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.  \n[99]Like you care. \n[100]I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t. \n[101]What? \n[102]Why? \n[103]But you hate Joey \n[104]As in... \n[105]You did what? \n[106]But \n[107]Why didn't you tell me? \n[108]No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage. \n[109]I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes. \n[110]God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself \n[111]I guess I'll never know, will I? \n[112]Come in. \n[113]Hi, Mommy. \n[114]You like?  My date should be here in five. \n[115]I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know. \n[116]Let's go. \n[117]What are you doing here? \n[118]I did. \n[119]That's for making my date bleed \n[120]That's for my sister. \n[121]And that's for me. \n[122]Are you sure you don't want to come with us?  It'll be fun. \n[123]You looked beautiful last night, you know. \n[124]I hope so. \n[125]Let go! \n[126]I just wanted -- \n[127]No! I just wanted \n[128]Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch. I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I could.  Apparently, this makes me a horrible person.  I'm sorry. \n[129]I swear -- I didn't know about the money.  I didn't even know Joey was involved.  I would never intentionally hurt you, Kat. \n[130]We'll be getting back to you. \n[131]Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me? \n[132]They do not! \n[133]He's more than freaked.  He's froke \n[134]Patrick -- is that- a. ", "CAMERON": "\n[1]I don't think so, ma'am \n[2]So they tell me... \n[3]North, actually.  How'd you   ? \n[4]Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though. \n[5]Thirty-two. \n[6]How many people go here? \n[7]That I'm used to. \n[8]So where do you fit in all this? \n[9]That girl -- I -- \n[10]Who is she? \n[11]Why not? \n[12]Why do girls like that always like guys like that? \n[13]He always have that shit-eating grin? \n[14]Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada \n[15]You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? \n[16]You all right? \n[17]That's her?  Bianca's sister? \n[18]Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. \n[19]Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night? \n[20]Forget it. \n[21]Cameron. \n[22]Seems like she could get a date easy enough... \n[23]Why? \n[24]That's a shame. \n[25]Let me see what I can do. \n[26]I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. \n[27]What about him? \n[28]No - he could wrangle with the sister. \n[29]He seems like he thrives on danger \n[30]They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? \n[31]Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not? \n[32]That's what I just said \n[33]I thought you hated those people. \n[34]So now all we gotta do is talk to him. \n[35]Hey, there \n[36]Later, then. \n[37]You got him involved? \n[38]You're one brilliant guy \n[39]Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz. \n[40]That's because it's such a nice one. \n[41]Well, there's someone I think might be -- \n[42]There. \n[43]I guess he didn't see me \n[44]La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance? \n[45]You got something on your mind? \n[46]You have my word.  As a gentleman \n[47]How do you get your hair to look like that? \n[48]You know, I read an article about that. \n[49]We wanted to talk to you about the plan. \n[50]And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way. \n[51]This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party. \n[52]Will Bogey get bent? \n[53]Sure have. \n[54]I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. \n[55]She's not a... \n[56]So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? \n[57]All right.  What else is she partial to? \n[58]I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful. \n[59]Number one.  She hates smokers \n[60]Her favorite uncle \n[61]Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys. \n[62]Okay!  I wasn't sure \n[63]Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and \"angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion\". \n[64]Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night. \n[65]It's her favorite band. \n[66]So, then she says that she almost didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that dress because she thought she was mixing, you know, genres. And the fact that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here - \"really meant something.\" \n[67]Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - \n[68]I'm just the new guy. \n[69]Is it about me? \n[70]Evening, ladies. \n[71]Looks like things worked out tonight, huh? \n[72]I believe we share an art instructor \n[73]Certainly Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer? \n[74]The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? \n[75]No, I ' m not. \n[76]She used me!  She wants to go out with Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot! \n[77]It's off. The whole thing. \n[78]She's partial to Joey, not me \n[79]Sure \n[80]Have fun tonight? \n[81]I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be \"occupied\". \n[82]You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you? \n[83]Then that's all you had to say. \n[84]You always been this selfish? \n[85]Just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter. \n[86]And I'm back in the saddle. \n[87]What'd you do to her? \n[88]You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.  \n[89]Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?  Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.  \n[90]She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote \n[91]She kissed me. \n[92]You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. \n[93]You get the girl. \n[94]No... \n[95]What crap? \n[96]Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure... \n[97]I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. \n[98]The \"real you\". \n[99]No \n[100]Wow \n[101]Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man. \n[102]She okay? \n[103]Katarina? \n[104]I'd like to express my apologies. \n[105]I didn't mean for you to get -- When Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, I had no idea it would turn out so -- ugly. I would never have  done anything to compromise your - - - \n[106]They do to! \n[107]Can someone please tell her that sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?

People actually live there? \n[5]How many people were in your old school? \n[6]Get out! \n[7]Couple thousand. Most of them evil \n[8]We've got your basic beautiful people. Unless they talk to you first, don't bother. \n[9]Those 're your cowboys. \n[10]Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood. \n[11]To the right, we have the Coffee Kids. Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden movements around them. \n[12]And these delusionals are the White Rastae. \n[13]Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.

Someday I'll be sipping Merlot while those guys -- \n[16]are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is back, my friend. \n[17]You burn, you pine, you perish? \n[18]Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it \n[19]I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility. \n[20]Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. \n[21]Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. \n[22]You know French? \n[23]Guess who just signed up for a tutor? \n[24]You could consecrate with her, my friend. \n[25]Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. \n[26]The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. \n[27]You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you have no concept of the high school social code? \n[28]Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point? \n[29]You wanna go out with him? \n[30]What makes you think he'll do it? \n[31]No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz... \n[32]I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. \n[33]Did she actually say she'd go out with you? \n[34]You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side. \n[35]Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. \n[36]I'll let you handle that. \n[37]Hey. \n[38]Nope - just came by to chat \n[39]Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested. \n[40]Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't you? \n[41]But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? \n[42]So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job. \n[43]Exactly \n[44]Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will on my part. \n[45]I have a dick on my face, don't I? \n[46]Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. \n[47]Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.  Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching.  \n[48]He took the bait. \n[49]What? \n[50]The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. \n[51]I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's. \n[52]That's where we can help you.  With Kat. \n[53]Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. \n[54]We're your guys. \n[55]We're in. \n[56]In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out. \n[57]Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass. \n[58]One question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver?  \n[59]Good enough. \n[60]It's a lung cancer issue \n[61]Dead at forty-one. \n[62]Just for now. \n[63]He's pretty! \n[64]Ever been to Club Skunk? \n[65]Assail your ears for one night. \n[66]I also retrieved a list of her most recent CD purchases, courtesy of American Express. \n[67]I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows. \n[68]You told me that part already. \n[69]Uh,  yeah.

I'm sure William has some friends. \n[12]That's a charming new development \n[13]William would never have gone to a state school. \n[14]That's never been proven \n[15]Does it matter? \n[16]Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson. \n[17]Look, it's really easy. \n[18]It's Mandella with two L's.

I'm in favor of romance.  You're the one that wants to march on Washington every five minutes. \n[26]They were.  I only wish William could have been here to witness the rebirth of punk rock with us. \n[27]You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity. \n[28]You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her? \n[29]You didn't \n[30]Hi. \n[31]Yeah.

Something new and different for us. \n[39]\n[40]Have you seen him? \n[41]William - he asked me to meet him here. \n[42]I can't remember a word of Shakespeare right now. Isn't that weird?

Are you not feeling well? \n[13]I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence? \n[14]Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? \n[15]You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? \n[16]Fine.  Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week. \n[17]You're completely demented. \n[18]You two know each other?  \n[19]Dear God, stay away from her.  If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth. \n[20]Ladies?
