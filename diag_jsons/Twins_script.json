And I love this new clock. \n[3]You've done a great job on this room, Carla. \n[4]The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains. \n[5]Naaaw... I think we're going to be very happy here. \n[6]What's he doing back so early? \n[7]You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet. \n[8]'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'... \n[9]... 'everything's going my way'... \n[10]Carla, what a joy to look at you. \n[11]Is my partner and best friend, Al home from work yet? I am the bringer of good tidings. \n[12]Stop with that horrible song, you know how I hate birthdays; they're worse than Christmas. \n[13]For me? \n[14]A lighter, just like yours.   I don't know what to say, Al.   I'm all choked up. \n[15]Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful -- Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye. \n[16]That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well,                      * I put the money in the stock                           * market. I got this incredible                          * tip.                                                   * \n[17]I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T.                         * Industries? Probably not --                               * Secret takeover bid -- \n[18]A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane                      * Brothers. \n[19]On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm                        * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V. \n[20]I'm wiped out.

I came to say goodbye. It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. \n[29]I got involved in the stock market. \n[30]You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you. \n[31]You inspire me. \n[32]It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. \n[33]He silently starts to crawl away in the direction of the back door. \n[34]The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune. \n[35]Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- \n[36]That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- \n[37]I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes. \n[38]Fifty-three dollars?   You gotta                         * be kidding. \n[39]So?    Do I look normal to you? \n[40]At you, you jerk. \n[41]Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year. First round pick of the L.A. Clippers and now look at him. \n[42]World International Athletics                           * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living -- \n[43]Call me when you get out, they're always looking for centers in Italy... \n[44]You gotta talk into the phone,                        * asshole. \n[45]listening, somewhat amazed.    Who is this loony? \n[46]-- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You                         * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them -- \n[47]Huh?    Again? \n[48]Yeah.   Go on -- I got that part. \n[49]Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror. \n[50]I wouldn't be too sure. \n[51]-- That's right. I don't believe a word you said.                                        * \n[52]Oh... you want to help me get outta here? \n[53]Well, money talks, bullshit walks. \n[54]I'm in fast company here -- Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma... \n[55]Just don't ask me to bend over -- \n[56]Listen, 'twinny,' I hope you didn't blow your wad on those tickets, 'cause it's gonna cost a bunch more to release my car. \n[57]You do? \n[58]Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right? \n[59]Just gimme your wallet, okay? \n[60]No, you don't. \n[61]Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car -- \n[62]I can? \n[63]We're brothers -- right? \n[64]They arrest you, they put you                             * behind bars, they fine you and                            * then they hide your car.                                  * \n[65]Yeah --   How'd you know that was my car. \n[66]-- Get lost together -- \n[67]What're you doing with my desk? \n[68]It was time to redecorate anyway. \n[69]Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off. \n[70]'Aqua-Velva' -- you shouldn't have -- \n[71]I hope you got some good news,                         * Al --                                                  * \n[72]Great, I'll be right over. \n[73]In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.       He finally manages to look up at the giant -- \n[74]Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'. \n[75]We're twins. \n[76]Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a pause. \n[77]-- And this next is timed perfectly -- as he pushes the elevator button and... \n[78]Shouting as the door closes on the crumpled Klane. \n[79]Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!' \n[80]I like it when you hit people! \n[81]But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager. \n[82]No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money. \n[83]Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days -- \n[84]Due this morning. \n[85]I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me. \n[86]What are you doing with that finger? \n[87]That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed... \n[88]This car was supposed to be auctioned off at their charity drive tomorrow. Oh, well, let's go eat. \n[89]You think we should do a thing like that? \n[90]I saw a guy from the auto club do this once... \n[91]Whaddya know?    Beginner's luck! \n[92]As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside -- -- and the instant he does there is this terrible shrieking SIREN sound -- -- Vince frantically scrambles around, lying on the car seat, trying to make it stop but he can't -- -- and then two things happen: \n[93]No shit... \n[94]Ya see that little dot in your rearview mirror? That's me. \n[95]There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake. \n[96]Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass. \n[97]That's right... \n[98]God you look beautiful in this light. \n[99]Julius, meet Linda and... Her charming sister, Marnie. \n[100]Goodbye girls, see you soon. \n[101]Yeah.   Kind of. \n[102]Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you. \n[103]That's the best way --   women love men who are mysterious   and devious. It keeps them on their   toes -- makes them excited you   know what I mean? \n[104]You do like women, don't you? \n[105]Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you? \n[106]He's a 230-pound virgin.                              * \n[107]Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius. \n[108]The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it! \n[109]Dinner is served! \n[110]So, let me get this right. One of                    * our fathers was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T. -- \n[111]Naturally... so all of our dads were these big shots and Mom was, like, Superwoman, but she didn't survive our delivery. I got sent to an orphanage while you were brought up in a tropical paradise by this scientist you do research for, but who doesn't actually pay you because you don't need money. Did I leave anything out? \n[112]You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... ... Sperm milkshake?                                   * \n[113]Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this? It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby... But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... \"My darling! My treasure! We didn't know! How can we make it up to you?\"' I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius. It's a crock. \n[114]I liberated this from my file at the orphanage. Read it and weep. \n[115]That's right, Julius, she abandoned me. \n[116]I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again -- \n[117]Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down                       * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem                     * to deal with. \n[118]What! \n[119]Or else what? \n[120]Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity. \n[121]-- Uh... Webster -- calling from California. I happen to have some merchandise you might want -- \n[122]It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about. Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son -- \n[123]Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut. \n[124]I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal -- \n[125]-- But -- \n[126]I can do better than five here. If you can do better than five million dollars, take it!                               * \n[127]F-five million dollars... \n[128]Beetroot? What? \n[129]I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair. I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer... \n[130]Five million dollars! \n[131]'Going back to Houston, Houston, \n[132]Jesus! \n[133]You scared the living shit out of me -- \n[134]Great. \n[135]Awww -- that's terrible. \n[136]Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a hurry. Sammy wants me to    take the car to Houston. Much    bigger bucks when you raffle for   charity in Houston. \n[137]A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me. \n[138]No we don't. \n[139]You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that -- \n[140]Why does everybody have to like me so much? \n[141]Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore -- \n[142]Nowhere -- \n[143]Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it. \n[144]I got something in here -- -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune! \n[145]I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once... \n[146]No you're not. \n[147]mouth; he's beaten and he knows it \n[148]This ought to fit you. \n[149]Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there! What is wrong with you? \n[150]You allergic to something? \n[151]What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode. \n[152]-- Are just born to be bad. It's you, Julius. Oooh, you are so scary... \n[153]It's his first T-shirt. \n[154]See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay? \n[155]Now promise me something. \n[156]If this professor Traven says he's never heard of Mom, and us twins, and all our dads, and the experiment, I don't want you to be upset. -- Because this is entirely possible. \n[157]Well, that's that. On to Houston. \n[158]Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security --                              * \n[159]Don't do this to me. I got a car to deliver. The last thing I need is a detour in the slammer -- \n[160]No... \n[161]... How did you know my name? \n[162]gazes at the \"blender\" we saw Traven demonstrating in 1953. \n[163]This must be where you made the milkshake... \n[164]But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom. \n[165]Whoa -- I'm the crap? \n[166]No, I want to hear this. I'm left-over crap? I'm no good? \n[167]You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?! \n[168]My life just got flushed down the toilet. \n[169]I'm genetic garbage. \n[170]I know this is a touchy subject                      * for you, Julius. But the fact is,                    * we don't look the same -- we don't                   * act the same, we don't talk the                      * same -- we don't dress the same.                     * \n[171]So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             * \n[172]Yeah? \n[173]A family?   You really think so? \n[174]With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees... \n[175]Always? \n[176]I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes. \n[177]Do I look like I need help? Here's the problem. Maybe I'll try on a couple of things myself. \n[178]You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see                         * Frankenstein? \n[179]That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white                   * guys.                                              * \n[180]Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on. \n[181]Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses! \n[182]Of course, but it's nice to make it official. \n[183]Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance. \n[184]I guess you haven't done that before either. \n[185]Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her. \n[186]It turns them to putty in your hands. \n[187]He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room. \n[188]Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- \n[189]-- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- \n[190]I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn... ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- \n[191]Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. \n[192]Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? \n[193]Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating. \n[194]Not all the time. Listen, Marnie's got the hots for you. Tonight could be your lucky night... \n[195]Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural. \n[196]I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. \n[197]I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time. \n[198]Hey, cut it out! Not in here! \n[199]Go easy on the beer, okay? \n[200]What are you talking about?    We didn't shoot anybody. \n[201]That's kind of drastic, don't you think? \n[202]How many of those... rules do you have? \n[203]I bet. \n[204]Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape. \n[205]I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night. \n[206]Maybe read her a bedtime story. Don't wait up for me. \n[207]Oh yes it does. \n[208]-- Eighteen -- nineteen -- \n[209]Julius gave me a few pointers -- -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first                       * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best. \n[210]I know she will -- I have that effect on people -- -- One hundred and forty-three --                      * one forty-four --                                      * -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start -- \n[211]Hey -- I sleep great every night -- -- what if she's disappointed in me? \n[212]Five hundred. Don't want to overdo. \n[213]You're right. I couldn't do this without you, Linda. \n[214]Whoa!   Move in together? \n[215]I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- \n[216]Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow. It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom. \n[217]There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore. \n[218]Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules. \n[219]Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune. \n[220]You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. \n[221]We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us. \n[222]Gotta be. Well, don't just stand there. \n[223]That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing. \n[224]Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing. \n[225]Twin sons. \n[226]We're kind of a surprise. \n[227]We were right -- \n[228]-- Is Mary Ann? \n[229]This is some chunk of real estate -- Mom owns it all, I guess. \n[230]No, of course not. \n[231]She's not famous anymore? \n[232]But -- but you said she was here -- \n[233]Can we get the hell out of here? \n[234]Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda? \n[235]I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money. \n[236]Bull-shit. \n[237]You hear that, everybody? The                          * creature from the black lagoon                         * just put in his two bits. I                            * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother. \n[238]Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving. \n[239]Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade? \n[240]I thought we had a deal here. \n[241]This is what? \n[242]Five million dollars -- \n[243]I trust you. \n[244]hiding behind some machinery, scurries deeper into the bowels of the warehouse. \n[245]crawling along the ground. He spots an open window up ahead at the end of the warehouse. Nearer, to his right, is another window, closed. Vince picks up a piece of pipe, aims, fires it at the closed window and as it breaks the glass -- \n[246]crouched near the open window, glancing back at Webster who has no idea where he is. Noiselessly, he slides out of the open window, briefcase in hand, starts to run away -- \n[247]No way... this is bullshit... Julius, you putz. \n[248]Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit... \n[249]Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire. \n[250]hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius. \n[251]I am never going to forgive you for this. \n[252]I had escaped. I was on my way to Brazil -- when I felt you. \n[253]Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience! \n[254]How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think? \n[255]Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. Try Brazil. \n[256]-- Hold it, don't I get a say in this? \n[257]You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun? \n[258]You should have checked if he had a gun, chump. \n[259]Ooooh -- you lied? \n[260]Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy. \n[261]Duck? Duck? You are developing real style, Julius. \n[262]Yeah, yeah, yeah. \n[263]You're my brother, right? We're family, right? \n[264]We're a rich family, right? \n[265]Return the money?!? Are you nuts?!?

According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.

Mary Anne Benedict. \n[113]She was my mother. \n[114]One of my fathers -- \n[115]Why didn't you? \n[116]Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died? \n[117]I have a twin brother, Vincent. \n[118]I'll go see him. \n[119]No, I don't -- but I'm learning. \n[120]Vince, the most amazing thing has happened. \n[121]I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is. \n[122]She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born! \n[123]And she was told that I died! \n[124]-- New Mexico is on the way to Houston. \n[125]Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico! \n[126]Yes we do!   And I'm coming with you! \n[127]You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back -- \n[128]'Put on your red dress, baby, \n[129]Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower. \n[130]Not at all -- I'm really looking                          * forward to tasting them.                                  * I should put on some clothes -- But I'm not sure... \n[131]I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts. \n[132]That's a great idea, Vince. \n[133]What? \n[134]No.   Why? \n[135]We can't all be born beautiful like you, Vince. Some of us -- \n[136]Let's rock and roll. \n[137]Thank you. \n[138]That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. \n[139]You still think I'm making it all up, don't you? \n[140]He's lying! \n[141]For the first time in my life, I am -- -- pissed off! \n[142]I'm going to make him tell us the truth... \n[143]marches inside, towards a startled Traven, as Vince tries to restrain him.

Start talking! \n[145]approaches a delivery table, touches it gently, looks back at Traven. \n[146]It's not true, Vince. \n[147]He's wrong. \n[148]Tell us where our mother is...                         * dickhead! \n[149]If you're lying to me. I'll be back. \n[150]You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin. \n[151]Vincent, we're twins.                                * \n[152]I know. \n[153]We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. \n[154]And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that. \n[155]You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. \n[156]You're the missing part of my life and I'm the missing part of your life. And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers. We won't be alone anymore, Vince. We can be a family. \n[157]... and a real home where you'll always be welcome. \n[158]Even when you've been bad. \n[159]Is this necessary? \n[160]Do I look okay? \n[161]I read the book. \n[162]We know where to find our momma! \n[163]Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before... what should I do? \n[164]Dance? \n[165]You dance with them?                                     * \n[166]-- Thank you for this, Vince -- \n[167]Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt? \n[168]Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. \n[169]But it's all from books. Until tonight I never had a beer. All theory, no practice -- the story of my life! \n[170]Can I ask you a question? \n[171]Am I shit-faced yet? \n[172]I better see if mine are, too. \n[173]You do that too, huh? \n[174]I don't think she really likes me. \n[175]Were you nervous? \n[176]For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you! \n[177]What do you want? \n[178]Don't touch him. \n[179]You moved too soon... \n[180]The second rule in a crisis situation: \n[181]If you choose to bluff, you must be prepared to have your bluff called. \n[182]Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life. \n[183]Where you going? \n[184]What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. It just doesn't get any better than this. \n[185]sits watching the TV, nodding in amusement, laughing, slapping his knee in pleasure. \n[186]You forgot your key -- I know. Lucky I waited up. \n[187]Either... I always sleep on the floor. \n[188]Good night. \n[189]Good night. \n[190]Good night. \n[191]Are you cold? \n[192]No, please, take my shirt.

I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know. \n[201]I'm a virgin. \n[202]I think I would have remembered... \n[203]It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince? \n[204]You mustn't always think of money. \n[205]We'd like to see Miss Mary Anne Benedict, please. \n[206]You think it's her? I do. \n[207]We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here? \n[208]We're her sons. \n[209]-- It is her -- \n[210]We thought that that woman -- \n[211]I can't wait to meet her. \n[212]May I ask you a question? Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense? \n[213]Take it easy, Vincent.   It's not her fault. \n[214]All I wanted was to make us into a family. \n[215]We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone. \n[216]He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it. \n[217]I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart. Here, I've only made things worse. \n[218]Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again. \n[219]He turns away. \n[220]spinning back, grabbing her up, folding her into his arms, planting a world-class kiss on her mouth. HOLD ON the two of them. He puts on his sunglasses and strides into the airport. \n[221]Don't fuck with me... pal. \n[222]Leave my brother alone! \n[223]I've got the money. \n[224]Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together. \n[225]Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns. \n[226]I needed something to read on the airplane. \n[227]You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape. \n[228]So, why didn't you go? \n[229]Nobody ever said being good was easy. \n[230]You haven't got any friends. \n[231]Shoot him.   This whole thing is his fault. \n[232]pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around. \n[233]From the dead man in the car. \n[234]I lied. \n[235]I had to. \n[236]Wait a minute. \n[237]You've forgotten something. \n[238]The third rule in a crisis situation. \n[239]Duck. \n[240]drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money. \n[241]You came back for me. \n[242]I always knew you would. \n[243]Thank you, Vincent. \n[244]We're a good family.

Now there are tears on his face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them. They're laughing.   They're crying.   They're holding each other. No words are necessary. Slowly... \n[249]They kepp you up all night again, too? \n[250]I think you need your diaper changed. What a surprise -- so do you. \n[251]Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together. ", "LINDA": "\n[1]Like what? \n[2]I'm not going to give him any money.
