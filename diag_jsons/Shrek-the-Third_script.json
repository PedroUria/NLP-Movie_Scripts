You've got a kingdom to run. \n[93]The one and only. \n[94]Alright, let's not overdo it. \n[95]You just overdid it. \n[96]Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally. \n[97]It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle. \n[98]Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks. \n[99]Or too salty! \n[100]Oh! Festering sores!

You're gonna be King! \n[112]Where do you think you're going? \n[113]You get back here young man and I mean it! \n[114]Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me. \n[115]You're right, Donkey. \n[116]What about this? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 61. \n[117]Oh c'mon. It's just a joke. Still... \n[118]Listen Artie... \n[119]If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you dude. I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what I am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby. \n[120]I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve.

My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me. \n[138]Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth. \n[139]You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them. \n[140]But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are. \n[141]Thanks Artie. \n[142]Yeah.

Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 113. \n[185]Well I guess you need to keep looking... \n[186]...cause I'm not giving up mine. \n[187]It's yours if you want it, you know, but this time it's your choice. \n[188]What'd I tell ya?
