So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening. \n[25]But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here? \n[26]Wasn't my fault you hit that truck. \n[27]I can't believe it -- you and Dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt. \n[28]That sounds exciting. Oh - some kid left this on the front porch. \n[29]Huh... a little me? That's weird. \n[30]Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls. \n[31]Hey Dad, how's the writing going?...

I don't get it. \n[46]You're kidding? And why is the door so small? \n[47]You didn't lock it. \n[48]Why don't you ever cook, Mom? \n[49]Looks more like slime to me. \n[50]Think they're trying to poison me? \n[51]Don't forget about me, guys. Okay? \n[52]Good-night...little me. \n[53]Whoa... \n[54]Huh? \n[55]MMMMM, something smells good. \n[56]Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? \n[57]You're not my mother. \n[58]My mother doesn't have b-b-buh... \n[59]Hello? \n[60]My father can't play piano. \n[61]I, uh \u00ad sorry \u00ad but she said to tell you the food's ready. \n[62]Mmmm, this chicken is good. \n[63]D'you have any gravy? \n[64]I'm real thirsty. \n[65]Mango milk shake? \n[66]Home? \n[67]For me? \n[68]I didn't know I had an Other Mother. \n[69]Really? \n[70]You mean like, hide and seek? \n[71]What rain? \n[72]Huh, what about the mud? \n[73]How'd you know I-- \n[74]I, I'd love to play, but ...

Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother. \n[84]You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers. \n[85]Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats. \n[86]Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky... \n[87]Ohh, Poo-eeeee! \n[88]H-hello?... \n[89]I think our mail got mixed up.

Your cat's not wild, he's a wuss- puss! \n[111]Wuss-puss... \n[112]So... that doll. Did you make it look like me? \n[113]C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat? \n[114]You're just like them. \n[115]I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either. \n[116]Ew! \n[117]You're kidding. \n[118]Dangerous? \n[119]So? \n[120]Stolen? \n[121]Well, what do you think? \n[122]Wait a minute! \n[123]Hi. \n[124]Cheddar?...

That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong. \n[133]My friend? \n[134]Great... another Wybie. Hello, Why-were- you-born. \n[135]Hello? \n[136]So he can't talk at all? \n[137]Hmm, I like it. \n[138]You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything. \n[139]Uh...It didn't hurt, did it, when she... \n[140]Whoa... cool! \n[141]Look at you! \n[142]My name! \n[143]It's wonderful, Wybie! \n[144]Wow! \n[145]Yah! Whooo-oooh! That was great! \n[146]We loved it, Mr. B. It was ... so ... so-- \n[147]A-mazing! \n[148]Ughhh. \n[149]Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse circus, not pretend like the crazy man's in our house. \n[150]Da-ad! I'm not five anymore. \n[151]But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these. \n[152]My other mother would get them. \n[153]So what do you think's in the other apartment? \n[154]Then why'd you lock the door? \n[155]They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here. \n[156]With those stupid uniforms?   Right. \n[157]Are you kidding me? \n[158]Gross-gusting. \n[159]Oh, like the gloves? \n[160]That's what you always say. \n[161]But I might be... \n[162]I knew it was real! \n[163]Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat. \n[164]Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk? \n[165]Cats don't talk at home. \n[166]Nope. \n[167]Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am. \n[168]How'd you get here? \n[169]The Other Mother hates cats? \n[170]What do you mean? She's amazing! \n[171]That's nonsense. He can't talk. \n[172]Hey, Wybie. \n[173]She's practically naked! \n[174]Oh my God. \n[175]I can't look! \n[176]Ahhh!!! \n[177]Yeah!! \n[178]Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat \u00ad Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic. \n[179]Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie. \n[180]Really? \n[181]What's that? \n[182]\n[183]\n[184]I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW! \n[185]I'm really, really tired. Yeah... I just need to sleep on things. \n[186]Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already-- \n[187]I'm going home tonight, robots - and I won't be back. \n[188]Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! \n[189]Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... \n[190]Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep... \n[191]Mom!... Dad!.. \n[192]Oh God, I'm still here? \n[193]Hey you! Where's the Other Mother?     I want to go home. \n[194]If you won't even talk to me, I'm gonna find the Other Wybie. He'll help me. \n[195]Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing. \n[196]Huh? Something's wrong. Shouldn't the old well be here? \n[197]But why? Why does she want me? \n[198]Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters! \n[199]Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it? \n[200]Small world. \n[201]Stop, he's one of the circus mice! \n[202]Gooooood kitty. \n[203]I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go. \n[204]You aren't my mother. \n[205]No. \n[206]Ow, what are you doing! \n[207]Ow, that hurts! \n[208]Who's there? \n[209]You ... you mean the Other Mother? ... \n[210]Who are you? \n[211]Why are you all here? \n[212]Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance. \n[213]Has she taken those, too? \n[214]I ... I'll try. \n[215]\n[216]Did she do this to you? \n[217]I hope that feels bet-- \n[218]Let's go! \n[219]Come on.

That's disgusting. \n[224]I missed you guys so much-- You'll never-- \n[225]Oh... the Wybie that talks... \n[226]You stole that doll, didn't you? \n[227]It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and.... \n[228]Grandma's missing sister! \n[229]I think I just met her. C'mon! \n[230]She's in there. \n[231]Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can. \n[232]Great! I'd love to get rid of it! \n[233]Where are you hiding, you little monster?! \n[234]The doll's her spy! It's how she watches you, finds out what's wrong with your life! \n[235]NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the-- --neighbors. \n[236]But it's all a trap! \n[237]Don't believe me?... You can ask the cat! \n[238]You're not LISTENING TO ME! \n[239]You creep! \n[240]Crazy?... You're the jerk-wad that gave me the doll! \n[241]Mom!   Dad! \n[242]Pick it up, Dad, pick it up. \n[243]Dad!

Good-night, Dad. \n[249]Hello. How did you get in? \n[250]Do you know where Mom and Dad are? \n[251]\n[252]How did this happen? \n[253]She's taken them. \n[254]They're not coming back, are they \u00ad Mom and Dad. Not on their own. \n[255]Only one thing to do. \n[256]I have to go back. \n[257]They are my parents. \n[258]Hmmm, okay. \n[259]Mom? \n[260]\n[261]Where are my parents? \n[262]They weren't bored of me.   You stole them! \n[263]Why don't you have your own key? \n[264]Mom, Dad, where'd she hide you? \n[265]Be strong, Coraline. \n[266]Why don't we play ... a game? I know you like them. \n[267]Uh huh. \n[268]An exploring game ... a finding things game. \n[269]My real parents. \n[270]And, and the eyes of the ghost children. \n[271]If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever and let you love me. And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes. \n[272]Then you let me go. You let everyone go \u00ad my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you've trapped here. \n[273]Not till you give me a clue. \n[274]And for my parents? \n[275]Fine. Don't tell me... \n[276]...it's a deal-- \n[277]What does she mean \"wonders?\" \n[278]Hmmm. \n[279]No!! \n[280]Stop!! \n[281]Why steal this? \n[282]Wow... \n[283]That must be it. \n[284]Don't worry, I'm getting the hang of it! \n[285]The pearl! \n[286]Oh, Wybie... \n[287]\n[288]I'm Coraline. \n[289]Uh-huh. \n[290]You don't get it, do you? \n[291]Of course you don't understand. You're just a copy she made of the real Mr. B. \n[292]Ahhh! No!! \n[293]\n[294]Noooo! \n[295]Oh God, I've lost the game; I've lost everything. \n[296]I think you might have said something like that. \n[297]Thank you. \n[298]I'm heading inside. I still have to find my parents. \n[299]Come on, quickly! \n[300]No, I ... I brought a friend. \n[301]You, you have a very funny way of showing it. \n[302]Hold on. \n[303]We aren't finished yet, are we? \n[304]I already know where you've hidden them. \n[305]They're behind that door. \n[306]Mom.   Dad! \n[307]Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. \n[308]No ... I'm ... \n[309]\n[310]\n[311]Mom! Dad! I missed you so much! \n[312]I didn't break it.

We can tell her together. \n[337]You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me. \n[338]Thanks for helping me, Miss Spink, Miss Forcible. \n[339]Actually, it's just lemonade. \n[340]How's Angus doing? \n[341]Cold drinks? \n[342]Thanks, mom. \n[343]How are the meeshkas, Mr. B? \n[344]Welcome, Ms. Lovat! \n[345]I'm Coraline Jones -- I've got so much to tell you!

Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things. \n[4]Huh? \n[5]You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it! \n[6]See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day. \n[7]Surprised she let you move in... \n[8]... my Gramma.
