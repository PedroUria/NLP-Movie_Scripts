If you can't stop the bleedin', we'll fuckin' sue ya. .Ed Aliano smiles, sticks swabs up Micky's nose to stop the bleeding, get everything cleaned out. . .Dicky pours water into Micky's mouth. Micky swishes it around, spits it out... \n[64]You okay? \n[65]What're you doin' out there? You feel like fightin' or what? You gotta jab and move. Don't stand in front of this guy, keep 'im off ya, jab and move - (shows him, jabbing the air, moving back &amp; forth Jab and move. What are you ascared of? You're fightin' scared again! Micky just nods. \n[66]We nevah shoulda fought that guy. Forget about it. Alice, HBO's waitin' for us. Sugah Ray's out there! C'mon you come too, Mick. Dicky heads back out. Alice looks at Micky, pats his cheek and follows after Dicky, leaving Micky sitting alone on the trainer's table. \n[67]RAAAAAAAY! Hey, Ray,-- The bodyguard stops him. Sugar Ray sees Dicky and waves him over.. .Dicky smiles, missing teeth. The HBO cameraman following after him. Sugar Ray shakes Dicky's hand. \n[68]That's what I was tellin' 'im! I told 'im, Ray. But Mungin weighs like 160 pounds! ESPN fucked us,-- (stretches his back, turns to Sugar Ray's girl Ya know I knocked Ray down. \n[69]Oh don't say that now. I know I look like shit, but,-- I went 10 rounds with you, Ray, I knocked you down. C'mon, lemme buy you guys a drink. \n[70]\n[71]he's fucking crazy; what \n[72]What's he talkin' to Mike Toma for? He starts to head over. \n[73]You can't trust that guy, Micky, you don't know 'im. Did he say anythin' about me? Did he say I could come? \n[74]Take care, Mick, we'll talk tommorrah. Little Dicky runs out of the house into Dicky's arms. \n[75]Hey, champ! Daddy's home! \n[76]Not this time, Dicky, try and gimme a sock in the nose-- Micky, lost in thought, stands at his car watching Dicky playing with Little Dicky. \n[77]What're you talkin' about? George walks over to his Micky sympathetically as Dicky grabs his brother by the shoulders. \n[78]ESPN screwed us, they owe us. We'll get anothah fight. Just get healed up, Micky, you're okay - \n[79]Just like I told ya! Against Joey Belinc in six weeks at Foxwoods! Kid's like 10-8. He's nuthin'. \n[80]17.5, I thought you said 25, anyway that's still good money, Mick. \n[81]What!? Charlene looks at Micky, as if to say, \"speak. is He looks at her, she starts to open her mouth, stops. \n[82]Why, how they been goin'? You're the one in the ring, Micky, yeah that last one was unfair, but we ain't gonna repeat that, so it's up to you in the ring. \n[83]What's his problem? Micky sits back and folds his arms, a bit frustrated. \n[84]What do you know about anythin'! We don't even know who you ah. \n[85]He don't know who she is! \n[86]And me. \n[87]Of course! Of course, Micky, I coulda had that! I know what you're talkin' about. You think I'm stupid? \n[88]Ma, please, let me say this I had opportunities like you're gonna maybe have. I had a girl I wanted to be home with.[Sad for a moment] You should have that. No one's sayin' you shouldn't have that. But I can't have you goin' to Vegas, we gotta stick together, Micky, please. I can get ya money to train yeah 'round, if that's what ya want. I'll handle it. Dicky looks at Micky. . .then turns to Alice and nods his head at her. He's got it. She's puzzled. Micky nods. Uncomfortable awkwardness as everyone looks at him and Charlene. \n[89]You put in $200, then you get ten OTHER people -- \n[90]-- to give YOU $200 each, and now you have your $2,000. \n[91]Understand? \n[92]Not everyone, just 10 a you. \n[93]No no no no. I'm givin' you an \n[94]You get that from TEN OTHAH PEOPLE you offah the opportunity to. \n[95]I love Cambodian people! They all yell in Cambodian at Dicky who looks aggravated, still holding onto Quackah. \n[96]They didn't understand. They're practically my gang, they usually listen to me but didn't understand the opportunity, anyway, where were \n[97]Oh, yeah, all the money I coulda made if we just fuckin' did it RIGHT, they threw me in too early. We didn't know, my mothah didn't know, Sugar Ray was too much, too soon. I needed to build slow. If I had Micky's discipline, with my talent, forget about it. My wife Debbie was the prettiest girl in Lowell, and my daughtah Kasie, I mean Kerry, I want Kerry to be proud a me. [Lights pipe] \n[98]Excuse me, BooBoo, it's still my movie, and this part [lights pipe] will make me and Micky's comeback more dramatic. I'll tell ya how crack works [inhales from pipe]. \n[99]When it entahs ya blood, ya get a peaceful energetic feeling ovah ya body, a kinda happiness - As his words continue we PUSH IN ON Dicky'S FACE and CUT TO FLASHBACK: medium shot, Dicky sits by a window, high; from this dissolves a second Dicky who dances a slow happy, funk dance across the room; out of this second Dicky dissolves a third Dicky who lies on the couch, Karen comes and makes out with him -- \n[100]-all the mistakes and the regrets of the past melt away, you feel so much lightah like when you were young and everything's in front of you. Then it fades and you gotta get high again. All three Dickys in the flashback - by the window, dancing, making out on couch -- flicker and vanish to the grating sound of aphone left off the hook. PULL OUT FROM Dicky's face in present \n[101]Fuck I gotta find money for Micky. What time is it? \n[102]\n[103]Empty ya pockets, put everything on the roof, ID, wallet, cash. Your wife know you're here, huh? \n[104]Don't turn around! Empty ya pockets! The guy empties his pockets onto the roof of the Volvo. BooBoo sits in Dicky's station wagon. \n[105]Walk to the sidewalk, we have to take the vehicle. [Takes cash, mumbles to Karen] Take half, get us some rocks. \n[106]You're 'bout to lose your breath. \n[107]We gotta talk, it was self-defense, right, say it was self defense, ya come outside, ya seen 'em beatin' on me, I didn't do nuthin' -- \n[108]I was doin' it for you! \n[109]What ah ya gonna do without me? Micky stares as Officer pulls Dicky away, sad. \n[110]- I can't believe they let Micky go. What about me? \n[111]What'd I do? They're aftah me. I'm fuckin' Dicky Ecklund. I'm gonna have to plead out, right, get like three yeahs. Could HBO help talk to 'em? What's gonna happen to my movie? I'll be out in a yeah or so, maybe less with good behaviah. We can finish it then, \n[112]What about my comeback? I didn't do nuthin'. Who's gonna take care a Little Dicky and, what about Tommy? \n[113]I know.  They're lettin' everybody on the first two tiers watch it tonight. C'mon, hit daddy with a kunckle sandwich. Bang-bang. Right in the mouth. (takes Little Dicky's hand, hits own mouth C'mon, a knuckle sandwich! .Little Dicky hits Dicky in the mouth again. . .And Dicky pops out his fake teeth. Little Dicky cracks up laughing. ) \n[114]- My teef, my teef, Dicky, you knocked out my teef! \n[115]It wasn't supposed to work out this way. Say we did it for the kids, ma. \n[116]About drugs, and all that. Is Micky gonna watch it? You ask 'im why he don't come to see me? All I do in here is think about comin' back and workin' with Micky, that's what keeps me goin'. I want a second chance to do it right for him and win a title. Will ya tell him that for me? They hear a guard, \"C'mon, five minutes Dicky, wrap it up.\" Little Dicky reaches out and gently cups his father's nose.. \n[117]Collect call from Dicky. He hears a busy signal, operator say, \"Sorry, that line is busy, sir.\" Dicky looks back up at one of the TVs, Alice and Little Dicky sitting in the living room watching a tape of 24- year-old Dicky fighting Sugar Ray Leonard on HBO. He hangs up the phone and walks out of the day room... \n[118]I gotta go home, Harry. I gotta tell Dicky it's gonna be okay, he don't gotta cry. \n[119]- He don't gotta cry no more. \n[120]Yeah, sure, they got ya fighin' Alfonso Sanchez. \n[121]Yeah, HBO's all invested in the Mexican, Micky, wake up, they don't care if you get killed. Toma did it. He's usin' ya like a steppin'- stone for Sanchez. \n[122]I seen that Mexican fight, Micky! He hits very hard! 15 knockouts! Undefeated! Are you crazy? That idiot LoNano went right for it! He's usin' you to steal money! \n[123]What's ya plan, Mick? How ya gonna fight Sanchez? \n[124]Oh yeah, you are. \n[125]They won't let us watch the fight cuz it's 'violent'! They let us watch the stupid documentary on crack but not my own brothah fightin'! [people look at them]. Are ya scared? Are ya embarraassed cuz ya don't even have a plan? Just tell me. \n[126]I won't shit on it. Come on, just tell me. \n[127]Who came up with that? Fatty O'Keefe? \n[128]Ya gotta run against this guy! Move, let 'im punch himself out \n[129]Take 'im to the body, Micky! Get inside. Switch stances like ya workin' his right, hit 'im on the left. Be careful, don't switch outside. \n[130]I'm TALKIN' about the way you fight, you moron! You know I'm right!
