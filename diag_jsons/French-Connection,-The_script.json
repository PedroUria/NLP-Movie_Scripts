They call him SAL.  He's a sweetheart.  He once was picked up on suspicion of armed robbery. Tried to hold up Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue!  In broad daylight!  Could have got two-and-a-half to five, but they wouldn't prosecute.  Also downtown they're sure he pulled off a contract on a guy named DeMarco. \n[21]Her name's Angie... Fast filly... she drew a suspended for shoplifting a year ago... only a kid, nineteen according to the marriage license. \n[22]He's had the store a year an'a half... takes in a fast seven grand a year. \n[23]The Merc's in his wife's name.

Cop a few zzz's while you can. \n[75]This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop. \n[76]My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers. \n[77]Hey, Mac, have you seen...? \n[78]...the guy who runs this joint? \n[79]He's in the brown Lincoln - foreign plates. \n[80]Four. \n[81]Third time around. \n[82]What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv? \n[83]You're sure? The manufacturer's spec says it should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This one's carrying roughly 120 extra pounds somewhere. \n[84]When it was booked in at Marseilles it weighed the same.  120 pounds overweight.  Jimmy has to be right. \n[85]Got it for you, Randy -- it just came in from downtown.  Who's Devereaux? \n[86]I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we get reports on a couple hundred vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a little tough to keep track. \n[87]Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not even a scratch.  You're all set. \n[88]Someone stole it right off the street, huh?  You're gonna have to pay the tow away charge. \n[89]Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape. You must lead a charming life. \n[90]Phil, you take that side, Bill, go around the other way. \n[91]Jimmy? \n[92]Jimmy? \n[93]He's gone, Jimmy.  Bill is dead.

Now go back to work, you're off Special Assignment. ", "MARIE": "\n[1]Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite? \n[2]Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me g\u00e2tes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai achet\u00e9. \n[3]Regarde mon p\u00eacheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire tr\u00e8s froid cet hiver. \n[4]Mais non, c'est pour toi. \n[5]Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien! \n[6]Comment va-t-elle? \n[7]Le sommes nous? \n[8]Just for mistakes of parking? \n[9]Darling, may I have this one? \n[10]It looks so lonesome here. \n[11]Why is it called Hellgate? \n[12]Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman. \n[13]What is that old building? \n[14]What was it? \n[15]For garbage? \n[16]Look, darling, they sell these at the Smithsonian. \n[17]I'm going to put them on the cat. \n[18]Of course.  But I am not going to tell you what it is until we are back in Marseilles. ", "LA VALLE": "\n[1]That's enough now, ladies and gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at his hotel in half an hour. \n[2]There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month. \n[3]No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier. \n[4]Notice he will never mention the year of the car. \n[5]Yes, sir.  That man in the dark jacket is our buyer. \n[6]It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world. \n[7]Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City. \n[8]The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here. \n[9]Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it. \n[10]Mmm. \n[11]I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France. \n[12]Oh, it's been abandoned for years. \n[13]It was a crematorium. \n[14]For dead bodies. \n[15]The car was lost sometime this evening.  First they send us to Pier One -- then they send us here -- \n[16]In point of fact, M. Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French Television.  He left the car to look at some point of interest. \n[17]Mr. Devereaux is an extremely important guest of this country. He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government.  Here are his credentials from the French Consulate. Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film I suggest you locate his car immediately. \n[18]This is M. Devereaux. ", "DEVEREAUX": "\n[1]Enchant\u00e9. Alain, j'ai r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi \u00e0 votre proposition et j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accepter. \n[2]Not long enough.  Two... perhaps three... weeks at most. \n[3]The next several weeks will be very difficult and the middle of the ocean is the only place where the telephone isn't ringing all the time. \n[4]To make a Frenchman feel what it is like to be a New Yorker. \n[5]This is the new American religion, professional football.  It is where everybody goes instead of church on Sunday to express that peculiar American taste for bloodshed and violence. \n[6]These men, playing a \"game\" - make more money each year than many important business leaders, artists or government officials. It tells us something about this country and how its men live, or go to war with a smile, and sometimes die without a cause. \n[7]We were told by the Police Commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage.  I demand its immediate return. \n[8]I have been patient enough.  There is no reason I should have to waste time with this red tape. \n[9]What's that? \n[10]You mean the car's here now? \n[11]I was told these things happen in New York -- but one never expects it. \n[12]It is waiting for you in the garage. \n[13]I wasn't looking. \n[14]My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished. \n[15]An accomplice to what?!  What have you gotten me into, Alain?  You asked me to do you a favor -- and I did what you asked -- but you've taken advantage of me.  I have my reputation -- \n[16]Goodbye. ", "MUTCHIE": "\n[1]A big man could alluz beat a little man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain could murder Jim Brown if they ever fought. \n[2]Chamberlain's seven foot tall, right?  He's got a twelve-foot reach.  It's geophysics.  He's punchin' down on you with leverage. He cave your chest in. \n[3]Blackjack Burns coulds been the greatest ever -- \n[4]That's right, he couldn't fight legit.  One night at the Garden about 1950, '51 -- he fought either Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I think it was -- he took one o' those cream puff punches in the sixth -- the laziest left you ever seen -- missed him entirely.  Down goes Blackjack without even workin' up a sweat and the whole Garden gets up in its feet and I swear to Christ, everybody starts singin' \"Dance With Me Henry.\" \n[5]What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen? \n[6]What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops? \n[7]They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with. \n[8]Why not? \n[9]Yeah! \n[10]Where the hell do you think it is, potato head? \n[11]No wonder there's so many Mafia around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto Rican in Spanish Harlem. \n[12]I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, \"Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy.\" \n[13]Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya. \n[14]When ya go back on? \n[15]Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.

There's a man in almost every one of them. \n[4]There's nobody like that on six. \n[5]Perhaps he's visiting a guest. \n[6]There may be two... no, three who could fit it. \n[7]A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone. \n[8]Des Moines. \n[9]Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think. \n[10]Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.
