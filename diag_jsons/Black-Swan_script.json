{"dialogues": {"NINA": "\n[1]I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan. No answer. \n[2]Different choreography, like the Bolshoi's. It was the prologue, when Rothbart casts his spell. Still no answer. Nina continues to stretch. \n[3]I'm just excited to get back. \n[4]Look how pink. So pretty. \n[5]Plus he promised to feature me more. \n[6]What? \n[7]I think it's sad. \n[8]Beth's such an amazing dancer. \n[9]Fonteyn danced into her 50's... \n[10]If you want me to be. He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear. 10. \n[11]Should I go again? \n[12]It went okay. \n[13]Ow! She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot. \n[14]I'm fine! Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe. Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood. Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on. She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and starts spinning again. Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain, but keeps pushing. Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins.... She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed. \n[15]If that girl hadn't barged in. \n[16]I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it. \n[17]I know, mom. \n[18]Do you have a minute? He doesn't answer, just opens the door to the office and walks in. She takes a breath and then follows. \n[19]If now's not a good time... \n[20]I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it. \n[21]Well... \n[22]Yes, but- \n[23]I see. \n[24]I came to ask you to give me the part. \n[25]I can be the Black Swan too. \n[26]I want to be perfect. \n[27]\n[28]Sorry. She quickly leaves, shell-shocked. \n[29]Veronica? Veronica turns around. It's hard, but Nina decides to be a good loser. \n[30]Congratulations. Nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and Veronica immediately gets it. She excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls, wanting to see for herself. 20. Knowing the outcome already, Nina continues stretching in the deserted space, resigned to her fate. She finishes, grabs her belongings and walks out. \n[31]What? \n[32]Hey...Everything's fine...He picked me, mommy. She waits for a response. \n[33]Did you hear me?...Yes, I'm going to be the Swan Queen. Nina laughs at her mother's response and can't help but start crying. \n[34]I'll be home soon, okay? I just had to tell you. Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing. She's dreamt of this for so long, it's almost too much to bear. She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls herself together. She comes out of the stall... Horrified to discover \"WHORE\" written on the mirror in RED \n[35]Mom? Nina looks around, puzzled she isn't there. \n[36]Oh, mom. \n[37]Just a little piece. Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece. \n[38]That's way too much. \n[39]My stomach's still in knots. \n[40]Mom, don't. I'm sorry. Erica hesitates, but returns. She sets the cake back down. \n[41]It looks yummy. \n[42]Yeah...good luck finding a spot. \n[43]I know you are. I'm Nina. \n[44]Okay. \n[45]Thanks, Susie. Awed, Nina looks around the room. She scans Beth's photographs and personal belongings, and lands on a large bouquet of FRESH FLOWERS. \n[46]Beautiful. Susie leaves. Nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads. A faint smile curls her lips. She opens her shoulder bag and removes a SMALL SATCHEL. She pulls out a pair of DIAMOND STUD EARRINGS and puts them on. \n[47]Such a beautiful event. 29. \n[48]Just a second. She turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back of her neck, trying to cool herself. She checks her finger. No blood, but there's a HANGNAIL. Nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off. Accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her second knuckle. More KNOCKING startles her. \n[49]Nina. \n[50]Yeah... \n[51]I should probably get back. \n[52]Excuse me. 31. She opens the door and steps out, where she's immediately met by Leroy. \n[53]I think I drank too much. All those toasts... \n[54]Really? \n[55]I guess. \n[56]Oh, Upper West Side. \n[57]No, that's good. He starts to look for a cab. 32. \n[58]Hello? \n[59]Beth? What are you doing out here? \n[60]I was crushed to hear that you're leaving. \n[61]Some of us don't need to do that. \n[62]Beth, I'm- \n[63]Thanks. She looks up at him, expecting him to make a move. Instead, he walks away, and sits in a chair. He gestures for her to sit as well. Confused, she sits across from him, alone on the large couch. He takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her. Uncomfortable, she takes a drink as well. \n[64]Yes. \n[65]Me neither. \n[66]No... \n[67]A few. But no one serious. \n[68]Excuse me? \n[69]Okay. \n[70]Yes? \n[71]You know I asked. \n[72]That's not why. Erica looks adoringly at Nina's reflection in the mirror. \n[73]They're fake. 37. \n[74]I can do it. \n[75]It's just a rash. Erica gruffly pulls Nina to the mirror and turns her around. \n[76]It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better. \n[77]\n[78]Mom, please. Erica grabs Nina's other hand. \n[79]What happened? 40. \n[80]Oh my god... \n[81]How do you know? \n[82]Was it right after we saw her? \n[83]It's okay. The older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on her rounds. Nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to wait. She hears the sound of shuffling feet, looks over, and sees the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall, comforting one another. Nina steps out from hiding and goes inside. \n[84]Please don't... 47. \n[85]Who's that? Lily emerges from the darkness, dressed to leave. \n[86]I'm fine. \n[87]We can't smoke in here. \n[88]Thanks... \n[89]Just had a hard day. \n[90]He's brilliant. \n[91]You don't know him. \n[92]I should go. It's getting late. \n[93]I'll be out in a second. She stays still, hoping she won't try to come in. Footsteps recede and Nina breathes. She runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood. \n[94]Do you have any corrections? \n[95]I didn't tell her that. \n[96]\n[97]She shouldn't have said anything! \n[98]I didn't. \n[99]I'm sorry. I'm sorry. \n[100]Lily, I need to talk to you. \n[101]Now. 53. \n[102]You told Thomas about last night? Lily falters, guilty. \n[103]Why would he talk to you? \n[104]You shouldn't have done that. \n[105]He's not. \n[106]Thanks. \n[107]What career? \n[108]You were 28. \n[109]And only... \n[110]Nothing. \n[111]Nothing. \n[112]It's fine. \n[113]Yes. \n[114]No. 56. Erica goes to the door and cracks it open, keeping the chain engaged. \n[115]Who was it? Erica doesn't answer. Irritated, Nina walks around Erica and quickly opens the door to find out. \n[116]Hello? Lily turns. \n[117]What are you doing here? Nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door. \n[118]Give me a second. \n[119]Mom, please! \n[120]How did you know where I live? \n[121]I don't think- \n[122]Wait. \n[123]I'm going out. \n[124]Let's go. \n[125]I think it's sweet. \n[126]Only Beth. \n[127]I don't think so. 59. \n[128]Guess I'm invisible. \n[129]I wouldn't know. \n[130]I don't want to talk about it. \n[131]What is it? \n[132]How long does it last? 61. \n[133]That's okay. \n[134]I'm gonna go. \n[135]Hi. \n[136]I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow. \n[137]Just a couple of hours? \n[138]Oh, I'm a dancer. \n[139]Nina. \n[140]We dance in the same company. \n[141]No, it's not. \n[142]You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets. \n[143]Sorry. Swan Lake. \n[144]You know it? \n[145]It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell. \n[146]Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself. \n[147]It's beautiful, actually. \n[148]Huh? \n[149]My hands are all sweaty. Andrew touches them. She grabs onto his hands. She looks at his face. His eyes twinkle at her. Lily slides in next to her. Nina sees her and melts into her body. Lily hugs her back. \n[150]Mmm-hmm. Late. \n[151]To the moon and back. \n[152]Ding ding ding. Lily snickers, Nina tries to keep a straight face, but ends up laughing. \n[153]Huh? \n[154]You want to know their names? 69. Erica grabs Nina's wrist. \n[155]There were two. Tom and Jerry... \n[156]I fucked both of them. \n[157]Don't come in here! Erica tries to open the door, but it gets stuck. She peers her eye through the crack. \n[158]It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore! Erica struggles a little with the door, but can't get it to budge. \n[159]\n[160]Why didn't you wake me up? Erica just stares at her, devastated. \n[161]I'm moving out. Nina whips out the front door and leaves her. \n[162]My music. She runs into the wings and sees the full company rehearsing on stage for the first time... Another girl dancing her part. The girl spins and Nina sees her face. It's Lily! Horrified, Nina runs onto \n[163]Thomas, I'm sor- \n[164]I overslept. \n[165]You put something in my drink. 74-76. \n[166]And took off this morning. \n[167]Yeah, you slept over. \n[168]But we... \n[169]You're lying. \n[170]Stop. \n[171]Shut up! \n[172]What's she doing here? \n[173]Thomas! He stops and faces her. \n[174]She's trying to replace me. \n[175]Lily. You made her my alternate. \n[176]She wants my role. \n[177]No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me. \n[178]Please believe me. He studies her for a moment, not sure what to make of this. \n[179]\n[180]What happened? \n[181]Hey! Hey! I'm still in here. No one answers. She looks at the cavernous auditorium. All those empty seats, faced towards her. Very overwhelming... She hears a noise in the wings. \n[182]Hey! Turn the lights back on! She gets to the other side of the stage, but the wings seem empty. Quiet. \n[183]Hello? No one answers. She heads towards the noise. The banging now accompanied by a \n[184]I'm so sorry. Beth begins touching the objects, vaguely remembering. 82. \n[185]I didn't mean to make you feel this way. It's happening to me now. She's trying to replace me. \n[186]I just wanted to be like you. Perfect. \n[187]It's not true. \n[188]Beth?! \n[189]Stop it! Stop! 83. \n[190]Mommy?! She goes out to investigate. \n[191]\n[192]Get OUT! She manages to get her all the way out the door. But ROTHBART'S HAND grabs the door frame. Nina SLAMS the door, SMASHING the hand. Erica SCREAMS in pain. Nina slams the door again, and again. The hand now human. She finally gets the door all the way shut. She steps away from it, nervous... She looks down, sees one of her knees SNAP backwards, like that of a bird. Then the other knee SNAPS back. Nina stumbles and falls. And SLAMS her head into the radiator. \n[193]Where's the clock? \n[194]It's dark. What night is it? \n[195]What time is it?! \n[196]I have to go. \n[197]No, I want to. \n[198]Get off me! 87. \n[199]Where is it? \n[200]Move. \n[201]You're crazy! \n[202]She's gone. \n[203]Let go! \n[204]I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps. \n[205]I'm fine. \n[206]What? \n[207]Fuck. Have you announced it? \n[208]After Beth, do you need more controversy? \n[209]I'm here, Thomas. I'm doing it. 90. \n[210]It wasn't my fault. He dropped me. He can't even look at her. \n[211]Get out of here. \n[212]Stop. Just stop. \n[213]Leave me alone. Leave me alone. \n[214]Leave me alone!!! 96. Her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the floor. The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD, but can't grasp it. The Double squeezes down. The blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and she lunges... Finally grabbing the SHARD. And DRIVES it into the Double's stomach. Nina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up. The Double is now LILY. Stunned, Lily looks down and touches the stab wound. \n[215]It's my turn. Lily coughs up blood and collapses, dead. Nina stares at her, breathing heavily, high on adrenaline. A KNOCK on the door. \n[216]One second. She goes to the door, opens it just a crack. She peeks through and finds... LILY looking back at her. \n[217]I felt it. \n[218]...perfect. \n[219]Shhh... \n[220]It was perfect. ", "LEROY": "\n[1]We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell. \n[2]Her wish is granted in the form of a prince. \n[3]But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him. \n[4]Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom. \n[5]Good morning, company. \n[6]We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real. 8. \n[7]And a new production needs a new Swan Queen. A fresh face to present to the world. Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep their cool. \n[8]But which of you can embody both swans? The white and the black? Nina prepares for disappointment. \n[9]All the soloists I touched... Please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon. The girls are confused. \n[10]And the girls I didn't touch, meet me in studio B at five. Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones he's selected, purposefully toying with them. \n[11]So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen? \n[12]Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours. \n[13]But I'm not. \n[14]Maestro, Odile's Coda. \n[15]Show me your Black Swan, Nina. \n[16]Come on, not so controlled. \n[17]Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world! The fouettes are like a spider spinning her web. Come on! Attack it! Attack it! 11. The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to an iPod. \n[18]Good of you to join us. The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her earphones to talk. \n[19]Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot. LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath. \n[20]Go on, get warmed up. \n[21]I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina. She looks down, getting his meaning. \n[22]Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The White Swan's variation... Furious, Nina marches out of the room. \n[23]Yes, Nina? \n[24]Now's fine, what is it? \n[25]How thrilling for you. \n[26]Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now. \n[27]Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so... \n[28]You're not going to try and change my mind? \n[29]You must have thought it was possible, coming to find me like this. 18. \n[30]Why are you here? All dolled up? \n[31]That all? \n[32]Truth is, when I look at you, all I see is the White Swan. Yes, you're beautiful, fragile, fearful. Ideal casting. But the Black Swan...it's a hard fucking job to dance both. \n[33]Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself. \n[34]All that discipline, for what? \n[35]Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence. \n[36]Very few have it in them. \n[37]Ow! Fuck! \n[38]You bit me. 19. She's too scared to respond. \n[39]I can't believe it. That fucking hurt. He goes to the mirror to check for damage. He glances back at Nina. \n[40]Okay! The music stops. Nina breaks out of character and looks at Leroy, anxious for his reaction. The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles, clearly pleased. \n[41]Okay, Nina. Very good. Nina smiles, relieved. Leroy hops out of his chair and approaches. \n[42]But I knew the White Swan wouldn't be a problem. The real work will be your metamorphosis into the Black Swan. \n[43]I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite. He gives her an impish smirk. She looks down, embarrassed. \n[44]Watch the way she moves... 26. Leroy has snuck up behind Nina at the doorway and gets very close to her. \n[45]Imprecise, but sensual. She's not faking it. Pay attention. Lily makes a small mistake, but cracks up laughing, amused rather than bothered by her blunder. Nina stares at her, attracted and threatened. \n[46]Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile. \n[47]Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. \n[48]As I stand here tonight, I see so many familiar faces. Your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and I am very grateful. \n[49]Let me begin with a very important announcement. You all have had the chance to be enchanted, transported, sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company. She has been an exceptional inspiration to my work, a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage. You all know who I am talking about...Beth Macintyre \n[50]As we all know, every great career comes to an end. Beth is retiring at the end of the season. She will be giving her farewell performance as Melpomene, the role she originated in my first ballet. 28. \n[51]She will be greatly missed, but she will always be remembered. My little princess. Amidst the mummering, Nina sees Beth quietly sneak out of the crowd and out the front door. Leroy quickly covers. \n[52]But as we bid adieu to one star, we welcome another! He looks at Nina. She stops picking her nails, self- conscious. \n[53]As you know, we open our season with my new version of Swan Lake. Taking the role of our new Swan Queen is the exquisite Ms. Nina Sayers. Restrained APPLAUSE. Nina steps forward and curtseys. Someone seems to GIGGLE at her. Insecure, Nina glances towards the source and sees Lily flirting with a RICH GENT, uninterested in the official proceedings. \n[54]Soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform, tonight we raise a glass. To all of you, to Nina, to Beth, to beauty! He downs his drink and the crowd follows suit. \n[55]Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors. She shakes DR. BRINSON'S hand and curtseys to MRS. BRINSON. \n[56]And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein. Nina repeats the pleasantries, this time noticing that one of her cuticles is bleeding. She awkwardly pulls her hand away. Leroy leans in and whispers in her ear. \n[57]Relax, you're doing great. \n[58]Ah, there you are. Lily closes the door behind her. \n[59]You did well. \n[60]They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece. \n[61]I'll get you a cab. Where you going? \n[62]Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way. She gives him a coy glance, reading between the lines and hiding her excitement. \n[63]For a drink. Unless you've had enough. \n[64]A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait here. \n[65]What's going on? \n[66]You're drunk. You should go home. \n[67]Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together. \n[68]Come on. 34. \n[69]Here. She turns, finds Leroy holding out yet another flute of champagne. For himself, a scotch. \n[70]I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little. \n[71]The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us. 35. \n[72]Good. So, do you have a boyfriend? \n[73]Have you had many in the past? \n[74]You're not a virgin, are you? \n[75]Then there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there?  And you enjoy making love? \n[76]Sex. Do you enjoy it? \n[77]We need to be able to talk about this. \n[78]So? 36. \n[79]I have a homework assignment for you. \n[80]Go home and masturbate. Live a little. She blanches, scandalized. He finishes off his scotch and stands. \n[81]It's late. Lots of work tomorrow. The doorman will find you a cab. He leaves her alone in the living room. \n[82]She walked into the street, got hit by a car. \n[83]I'm sure she did it on purpose. \n[84]Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive. Nina hesitates, but has to ask. \n[85]It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you. She looks away, not so sure. \n[86]Nina, don't let yourself be distracted. Dance is not immortalized like music, poetry or art. It lives for now. For this moment only. And this is your moment. She attempts a nod. \n[87]No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him. She pulls away from David, not at all coyly. Leroy exhales, frustrated. 43-46. \n[88]Forget about control. I want to see passion. She still looks tense, not getting it. \n[89]Let it out! \n[90]David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her? David snickers, embarrassed, shakes his head. \n[91]No, of course not. No one would be. Leroy comes face to face with her. \n[92]Nina, your Black Swan still looks no different than your White Swan. She's's just as...frigid. darkness. \n[93]Fuck! Leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open. \n[94]Hey! We're still working in here. Lights back on. There's a momentary pause, and then the lights return. \n[95]Thank you!  Okay, you guys can go. Thank you for your patience. You stay. David gives her an insinuating glance, then shakes his head. Very used to Leroy's \"methods.\" \n[96]I'll be the Prince. Made nervous by his touch, she nods. He walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist. He starts humming the score. And then they begin. They do a series of lifts and spins, Leroy bracing her. He lets go, she moves away from him. \n[97]Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me! He grabs her wrist. She spins. He lets go. He grabs her other wrist, she spins to face him. They get very close. Just before they kiss she dips, pulls away. \n[98]Just feel my touch and respond. \n[99]Slow down. Open your mouth. \n[100]Open it. \n[101]That was me seducing you. It needs to be the other way around. \n[102]Try it again. \n[103]Again. \n[104]Again. \n[105]No. \n[106]Lily talked to me. Said she saw you crying. \n[107]She said you were upset and I should \"take it easy\" on you. \n[108]Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two. 52. \n[109]Or a fucking month. \n[110]I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her! \n[111]You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal. He walks away from her. \n[112]Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak! He tosses his chair across the room. SMASHING into the wall. \n[113]Keep going. Let's finish the Act. The piano music resumes, and the dancers pick up where they left off. 73. \n[114]That was good. Let's take 10, then we'll move on to Act 4. \n[115]Get warmed up. \n[116]The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain. Nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the \"cliff,\" stopping at the precipice. \n[117]You're not at all fearful. Filled with acceptance. Nina looks down. It's a short drop to a stack of pads, but a HARD FLOOR surrounds it. \n[118]You look at the Prince, then down at Rothbart, and, yes, up at the audience...And jump! She hesitates, fearful. \n[119]Go ahead. You'll be fine. Nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive. She falls...and lands in the pads, unhurt. Slight applause from the other dancers. \n[120]At last, I saw the Black Swan. \n[121]\n[122]What's going on? \n[123]There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice. \n[124]Every dancer in the world wants your role. \n[125]Nina... \n[126]Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning. Nina starts to speak, he holds up his hand to silence her. \n[127]Tomorrow is yours. Give a great performance, and you won't have to worry about Lily, or anyone else. \n[128]No more. Go home and rest. Shut down, she watches him walk away. \n[129]Nina? She turns and finds that Leroy has approached from behind her. \n[130]Lily, give us a minute. Leroy pulls Nina towards her room. Lily glares at Nina as she passes. \n[131]Are you okay? \n[132]Nina? \n[133]Nina! \n[134]I already asked Lily- \n[135]The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself. She nods. He takes one last look at her and leaves. She breathes a sigh of relief. Curious, she cracks open the door and peeks outside: \n[136]What a fucking disaster! He walks away. All alone, Nina sees everyone backstage looking at her. She runs, escaping their stares. \n[137]Get back out there! Get back- She stops his mouth with a kiss. The kind of kiss that you can't stop. Not desperate, but adamant. Finally she disengages, staring at him in the eyes, but before he can say anything... She turns and rushes back on stage. He's stunned. Like he's been run over by a truck. \n[138]Listen to them! They love you! Get up, get up! 102. \n[139]I always knew you had it in you, little princess. Go take your bow! \n[140]What did you do? \n[141]Oh my god. \n[142]Someone, get help. ", "LILY": "\n[1]I'm good. Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES. \n[2]Come on! I'm about to burst! Nina quickly balls up the peeled skin and throws it away. She opens the door. 30. \n[3]Hey! Look who it is. \n[4]I'm Lily, by the way. Don't think we've officially met. \n[5]Our New Swan Queen! That is so huge! You must be freaking out. \n[6]Stay. Keep me company. \n[7]You okay? \n[8]You sure? to be left alone. She digs out a cigarette from her bag. Offers it to Nina. Nina doesn't take it. \n[9]I won't tell if you won't. 48. \n[10]Big day's getting closer and closer, huh? I can't wait. You're going to be amazing. \n[11]So, want to talk about it? \n[12]Leroy play too rough? \n[13]He seems like a prick. \n[14]Sure, but not exactly warm and fuzzy. \n[15]Someone's hot for teacher. \n[16]It's okay. I don't blame you. 49. \n[17]Hey, I was only playing. Nina walks towards the door. \n[18]Nina? She ignores Lily and exits. \n[19]Okay... \n[20]Shut up. And they do. \n[21]What's wrong? \n[22]I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some trouble. \n[23]Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great. \n[24]I didn't fucking do anything. Lily takes off. Nina stares after her, at a loss. \n[25]Hey. \n[26]I wanted to apologize. Nina just stares, incredulous. \n[27]You were right, I shouldn't have talked to him about you. Erica opens the door and sticks her head out. \n[28]She's a trip... \n[29]I have my ways. \n[30]Relax, I got it from Susie in the office. I feel really shitty. Can I make it up to you? Take you out to dinner? \n[31]A drink? \n[32]Jesus. \n[33]Can't believe that's what he called her. So gross! \n[34]Little princess? He probably calls every girl that. \n[35]Well, I'm sure she lost the title after her game of chicken. Nina's smile fades. \n[36]Bet he'll be calling you little princes any day now. \n[37]Sure, just gotta let him eat the pussy. \n[38]Danke schoen. \n[39]Oh, I will. \n[40]What? \n[41]Here, wanna spruce up? \n[42]I always carry a spare, case I wake up somewhere unexpected. \n[43]Not like you need more attention these days. How is he? 60. \n[44]Thomas? \n[45]Yeah, right. \n[46]Relax, you're so tense. \n[47]One for you... \n[48]And one for me. \n[49]Don't worry, it's pure. Brought it with me straight from San Francisco. \n[50]You're kidding? You never rolled? \n[51]Oh boy. It'll just make you have a good time. Loosen up. See the night sky. \n[52]Couple hours. Tops. Nina looks at the pill, thinks about it for a second... \n[53]Sure? Nina nods. Lily puts the pill back, and SNAPS the case closed. \n[54]Heeey, thought we could use some drinks. \n[55]This is Tom and this is Jerry. \n[56]You can't leave, I bought you a drink. \n[57]What, you gonna go home to mommy? Live a little. \n[58]Tops. 63. \n[59]Go on. Nina takes another sip and smiles. \n[60]Let's go sit somewhere a little more comfortable. Gentlemen? She gets up and holds out her hands. The two men each grab one and she leads them deeper into the bar. \n[61]We're blood sisters. \n[62]Tom and Jerry are gay lovers. 64. \n[63]Oh, I just assumed. \n[64]In that case you're definitely NOT gay. \n[65]It's not for everyone. You probably aren't sophisticated enough. \n[66]Isn't that compliment a little premature? \n[67]I think we all need another round. Bottom's up. 65. \n[68]Tom, come with me? \n[69]Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing. \n[70]Nina! Nina turns towards the voice and, with relief, sees Lily exit the club. \n[71]Where you goin'? \n[72]Whoa... Nina turns around and sees her Double smiling at her. Nina flees to the door. Pauses. She peeks back and sees that it's actually Lily. Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up. Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other, passion exceeding coordination. Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed. She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously. Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina. Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one. Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash. There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand. Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists down. She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence. She digs her nails into Nina's hands. Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings. She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further... 71. Lily starts to go down on Nina. Nervous, Nina whimpers. Glances down and sees the DOUBLE. She tries to pull away. LILY shushes her. Nina calms back down, seeing that it's her. She takes a breath and succumbs. Bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens. She closes her eyes, allows the sensation to invade her body and CLIMAXES. She breathes her way back to earth. Slowly her eyes open. She rolls over towards Lily. But Lily is gone. Instead her DOUBLE hovers over her. \n[73]Hey... \n[74]He wanted to go through the spacing. Asked me to step in. \n[75]Oops... Least you had a good time, right? \n[76]Hello? \n[77]Yeah... \n[78]This morning? \n[79]Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and you have a dick. \n[80]We what, Nina? \n[81]What, you have some kind of lezzy wet dream? \n[82]Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me. \n[83]Was I good? \n[84]Hey...Thomas sent me. Nina pauses, recognizing her voice. \n[85]He made me your alternate.  Just in case... Nina pushes past her. \n[86]What are you doing here? The other girls follow her gaze towards Nina, and their smiles turn to confusion. \n[87]You're supposed to be sick. \n[88]Rough start, huh? Pretty humiliating... 95. \n[89]Wow...rude. \n[90]I'm worried about the next act. Not sure you're feeling up to it. \n[91]How about...I dance the Black Swan for you? \n[92]Hey...you were amazing. Nina's petrified. \n[93]Seriously. I'm sorry things got so messed up between us. Just, holy shit, totally blown away... 100. \n[94]Anyway, wanted to tell you. I'll let you finish. Merde. ", "ERICA": "\n[1]You're in a good mood. \n[2]Off-season always makes you grumpy. \n[3]He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company. 3. \n[4]What's that? \n[5]There. Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small \n[6]Sweet girl. Erica releases her and Nina begins eating. \n[7]How did it go? Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat. \n[8]You were late, so I called Susie in the office. An audition?! Can't believe he just sprung that on you. Nina nods. \n[9]So? \n[10]Just okay? Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up. \n[11]Darling? The tears start falling now. Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace. \n[12]Shhh, shhh, tell me what happened. 14. \n[13]I told them it doesn't matter how talented their daughter is, if she misses any more classes, she's out. She forgets half of what I teach her, and I waste time catching her up. It's ridiculous. Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them on. She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing the waters. She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again. Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor. \n[14]Everything alright? \n[15]Shhh. Almost done...You're working yourself too hard. We all have off days. \n[16]I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost. \n[17]He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the other. Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother. \n[18]Oh, sweetheart, I know it's disappointing. When you start to get older, there's all this ridiculous pressure. God knows, I understand. Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it into Nina's calves. \n[19]But it's alright. No matter what. You'll probably get to dance the Pas de Quatre again. That's such a wonderful part. Or maybe he'll make you a Big Swan. Either way, you'll shine. \n[20]Everything will be better in the morning. It always is. She strokes Nina's hair, humming along to the music. Nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined stare. \n[21]My daughter, the Swan Queen. She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug. She looks at the cake. It has a ballerina sketched with frosting. Nina hides her disdain. \n[22]It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling. Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake. \n[23]It's a celebration. \n[24]Fine then. Erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash. \n[25]I'm just so proud of you. Erica lifts the slice onto a plate. \n[26]Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there. \n[27]I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself. \n[28]I don't blame him. Erica starts to remove Nina's DIAMOND EARRINGS, but pauses. \n[29]Where did you get these? \n[30]Fooled me. Erica removes the earrings, then walks behind Nina to unzip her. Nina faces her. \n[31]Turn. Nina turns back around, reticent. \n[32]Oh Nina... Remembering, Nina pulls away from her. \n[33]What are you talking about? Nina checks her reflection and sees the RASH, red and irritated from scratching. \n[34]You've been scratching again. \n[35]I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit. You haven't done it for years. \n[36]It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much. Nina stares at her, seething. \n[37]Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you. Nina doesn't respond. Erica opens the JEWELRY BOX and the tinny music begins playing. She hums and starts to stroke Nina's hair. Nina tries to brush her hand away. But Erica brings it back and keeps stroking. \n[38]Nina? Nina looks at the door, already blocked by the hamper. \n[39]Has he tried anything with you? Nina doesn't respond. \n[40]He has a reputation... Nina tries to ignore her. \n[41]I have a right to be concerned, Nina. You've been staying late so many nights. \"Rehearsing.\" I hope he's not taking advantage, that's all. \n[42]Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did. \n[43]Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned. \n[44]The one I gave up to have you. 55. \n[45]So? \n[46]Only what? \n[47]What? \n[48]How's your skin? \n[49]We leaving it alone? \n[50]Let me see. \n[51]Take off your shirt. \n[52]Can I help you?  I'm sorry, she's not in. Erica shuts the door. Nina rushes out to see who it was. \n[53]It's no one. \n[54]Sweetheart? 57. \n[55]Your dinner... \n[56]Sweetie, you need to rest. \n[57]What are you doing? 58. \n[58]What? Nina ignores her and shuts the door. \n[59]Do you have any idea what time it is? \n[60]Where have you been? \n[61]You've been drinking. \n[62]What else? \n[63]What else have you been doing? Nina smiles coyly. \n[64]You need to sleep it off. \n[65]Be quiet, Nina. \n[66]Shut your mouth! Erica violently jams her fingers over Nina's lips, trying to silence her. Nina runs into her room and SLAMS the door. \n[67]What's this? \n[68]You're not my Nina right now! 70. \n[69]What are you doing? Nina pushes past her, in a frenzy. \n[70]Open the door!!! Erica violently pushes and pulls, jostling the piece of wood. Nina concentrates, takes hold of the growth and yanks. Blood vessels in her eyes explode, making the white turn red. Nina looks at the object held in her fingers: a sharp, TINY BLACK SPINE. Like that of a sea urchin. Damp, feathery wisps hang off of it. The door flings open. Erica rushes in and finds Nina half-naked, her skin inflamed. \n[71]Oh my god... Nina starts forcing her out the door. Erica pushes back. 85. \n[72]Stop, you're sick! \n[73]Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here. Nina looks around, disoriented. Sees her hands jammed inside thick socks, held on by rubber bands. Groggy, she tries to pull them off. \n[74]You were scratching all night. Erica helps remove the socks, her smashed hand wrapped in bandages. Nina weakly tries to sit up, but Erica pushes her back down. 86. \n[75]Rest. Shhh, rest. \n[76]Don't worry. \n[77]Don't worry. I called the theater and told them you weren't feeling well. \n[78]Lie down! \n[79]We're staying in here until you feel better. \n[80]This role is destroying you. \n[81]Nina... \n[82]Stop it. \n[83]What happened to my sweet girl? \n[84]Please, you're not well. \n[85]You can't handle it! \n[86]You fucking ungrateful- ", "BETH": "\n[1]What?! 9. Nina just shakes her head. Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down the hall in the opposite direction. Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door and peeks inside, curious. She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters. \n[2]What'd you do to get the role? 33. \n[3]He always said you were a frigid little girl. \n[4]So what did you do to make him change his mind? Suck his cock? \n[5]You fucking little whore. \n[6]I need to talk to you. \n[7]Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me! \n[8]I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you. \n[9]A token of my appreciation. He ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab. As they enter the cab, Beth calls after them. \n[10]Make the most of it Nina. Through the cab window Nina looks at Beth, troubled by her words. \n[11]What are you doing here? Stunned, Nina's unable to answer. Beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table. \n[12]You stole all these things? \n[13]I'm not perfect. I'm nothing. \n[14]Fucking nothing! \n[15]Nothing! Nothing!!! ", "VERONICA": "\n[1]Can't believe she's back. \n[2]She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore. \n[3]That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet. \n[4]No, someone new. \n[5]Like someone who's not approaching menopause. \n[6]What's sad? \n[7]Yeah, we know. \n[8]What? Nina shakes her head. A sudden energy sweeps the room, and she hears the sound of scuffling feet and whispering. \"It's up.\" \"She just posted it.\" \"C'mon.\" The dancers start exiting into the hallway. Veronica turns to follow. \n[9]Why did you tell me that? She turns and sees Veronica, her face flushed with anger. \n[10]Your idea of a joke? \n[11]Fuck you. Veronica storms away. The group of girls stares at Nina, making her very self- conscious. Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board, to see what Veronica's outburst was all about. First a few, then more and more of the girls smile at her. They make room for her as she pushes through. She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE, finds \"Swan Queen\" \n[12]Look who's gracing us with her presence... \n[13]Ooooh. The other girls giggle. ", "ANDREW": "\n[1]Actually it's Andrew. \n[2]You haven't told me who you are. \n[3]No, I mean your name. \n[4]Well? \n[5]I've never been to the ballet. \n[6]So...what are you guys working on these days? \n[7]Yeah? \n[8]Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about? \n[9]Okay. \n[10]So a happy ending, then? \n[11]Like you. \n[12]I said you're beautiful. 66. She giggles. \n[13]That funny? She gives him a flirtatious glance. ", "STAGE MANAGER": "\n[1]Act 2's starting. Ten minutes. She removes a slipper off one foot. Her big and second toe, and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together. Puzzled, she peels them apart. She removes her other slipper and finds the same toes completely FUSED, forming two large toes with double toenails on either side of the middle toe. She touches the bird-like foot, concerned, but slips on her tights and hides the feet. \n[2]Go. Nina takes a last breath and runs on. \n[3]What are you doing? You're on! He gently nudges her, and she has to run back on. \n[4]That's intermission! Act 3 in fifteen. The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her. Nina sees Leroy on stage chewing David out, behind the closed curtain. David spots Nina, glares at her, and sulks away. Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina. Nina cautiously approaches. \n[5]Black Swan, places in 5. Nina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet. \n[6]That's you! She leaps back on \n[7]Great job. You got fifteen til the last act. She nods and arrives at her room. She opens the door, makes sure no ones looking, and enters quickly. \n[8]White Swan in 5. 101. ", "DAVID": "\n[1]Hey there... Nina turns and sees DAVID, the high-cheeked, cocky dancer playing Prince Siegfried. \n[2]It is so full, where do I stand. It is his version of a joke. Nina politely laughs. \n[3]I am David. \n[4]Yes. Here we go, huh? She nods, nervous. \n[5]Have fun. David and the Piano Player leave them alone. \n[6]What the fuck? She's too freaked to respond. They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together. Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit. The Little Swans start swirling off stage. Leaving Nina and David alone. David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan. She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she disappears into the wings. \n[7]", "TOM": "\n[1]Tom. \n[2]You two sisters? \n[3]Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you look alike. \n[4]Very funny. \n[5]It's pretty boring, isn't it? \n[6]You've got some mouth, you know that? \n[7]Yeah...that'd be neat. "}}
