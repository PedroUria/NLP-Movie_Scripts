Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon! \n[13]Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest! \n[14]Let's be fucking honest... \n[15]... This is a crucifixion! This is political! Don't tell me it's not! \n[16]... I have a drinking problem! \n[17]Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter. His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray. Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne. \n[18]Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have some news. I---- \n[19]Huh? \n[20]The cheeses. \n[21]The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did Kathleen say? \n[22]When you left the message? \n[23]Well she, I don't know, I guess we had bigger news today. My day didn't revolve arou---- \n[24]Well, since I didn't get the message, no, I didn't get the cheeses. But hang on to your hat, I---- \n[25]Honey, we have to talk. \n[26]Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese. \n[27]You're lactose intolerant? \n[28]Or you have acid reflux?    They're two different things. \n[29]Then you misspoke yourself.    So I---- \n[30]If you want he'll show you his great big gun. \n[31]Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist. \n[32]Uh-huh. \n[33]I tried to tell you this afternoon. \n[34]Our guests came. We---- \n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]I've been thinking about it.    A book, a sort of, sort of memoir. \n[43]You okay there, Dad? \n[44]... Dad, I left my job at the Agency... \n[45]... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad, government service is not what it was when you were in State. Things are different now. I don't know, maybe it's... it's... the Cold War ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission... \n[46]... I'm writing a memoir. I think it's going to be pretty explosive. But I don't think you'll disapprove. I don't think you'll disapprove. Katie has had trouble accepting it. \n[47]But... sometimes there's a higher patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes, change is hard. It's hard on Katie. But we'll be okay. We'll be okay. Life is change. This is good. We were all blocked up, Katie and me. This is, this is a blessing in disguise. I'll go into training, you know. Lay off the sauce. Like you did. You managed to do it. Finally. And then I can concentrate on, you know. New beginning. And this'll all have been for the best. Don't you think Dad? \n[48]... Cold. \n[49]... I guess we should head back. \n[50]We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. We thought of the Agency less as... less as... \n[51]... The principles of George Kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us. In fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service. Like the State Department's China Hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um... \"Murrow's Boys,\" the fabled----in a different---- \n[52]Hello. \n[53]...

He pours coke sizzling onto the ice. He pauses for a long beat. He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet. He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass. He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring: \n[55]Single... \n[56]Hello? \n[57]Yes----uh----Who is this? \n[58]Who is this? What time is it?     Who are you? \n[59]Worried? \n[60]What on earth are you talking about? Who am I speaking to? \n[61]What documents? What are you talking about? \n[62]Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!

Hello! \n[73]There's some clown----a couple of clowns ----somehow got a hold of my memoir---- \n[74]Stole it or----I have no idea how they got it---- \n[75]My memoir, the book   I'm writing. \n[76]Well they----I... I've no idea how they got it. \n[77]And you, I take it, are \"Mr. Black\"? \n[78]The fifty-thousand dollars. \n[79]All right. Let me explain something to you, \"Mr. Black.\" You know who I am; I know who you are. \n[80]Yeah. What you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony. That's for starters. \n[81]Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime. If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your Schwinn bicycle over there. \n[82]Now give me the fucking floppy or the CD or whatever the fuck you have it on, and I will---- \n[83]Give it to me, fuck! \n[84]I know who you are, fucker! \n[85]Holy fucking----you fucking morons! \n[86]...

Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in fact----so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you use. \n[104]No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? Of a regular publisher? \n[105]Uh-huh. I see. So they don't---- okay... Are you well? \n[106]Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you Sandy. \n[107]Bitch. \n[108]... What? \n[109]... What the fuck? \n[110]What the fuck? \n[111]... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know why the check for my slip fee was returned for insufficient funds... Slip fee, for docking my boat, the check was returned... No, m'dam, it's not zero, I have about forty thousand dollars in that account... When? ... When?... But she can't do that----no, yes, technically it may be a joint account but she doesn't use it, it's not her money... No! No! What access, it's not possible! Without my permission? What about the, my, the, our savings account? My savings account?... I don't know the fucking number! You think I memorize the fucking numbers on my fucking bank accounts! Moron!... Hello? \n[112]Yeah? The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT! \n[113]Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new fucking keys! \n[114]New keys... \n[115]New... fucking... keys...

You represent the idiocy of today. \n[123]Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to ask about that moronic woman. \n[124]You're in league with that moronic woman.

I mean, I know his name, not like his rank. \n[38]Osbourne.    Cox. \n[39]Oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community. \n[40]Well I think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is. \n[41]Not what we know. \n[42]And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate. \n[43]Are you kidding? \n[44]Sources. \n[45]Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water? \n[46]... You know how far this is from my place? \n[47]I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie. \n[48]I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder. \n[49]Shall we give him a tinkle? \n[50]Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved.

I am very fucking surprised he did not give us the reward. \n[71]But it doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball. \n[72]Well, that's----he sounds very senior.
