I think we should talk about it. \n[29]No, it'll put you in a bad mood. Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their food. A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass.

Barney still growls. \n[39]Maybe later. \n[40]Little bastard. Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature, comforting it     11 23. Settle down, Billy-There's no reason to get upset. The little fellow's scared. He hates bright light.. Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on his face. He looks -at t em. There's blood on his\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd4ingertips. Billy looks at Mogwai. The creature looks at Billy. It giggles. \n[41]Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to Billy's arm. He jumps back. \n[42]Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him. \n[43]Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature.     24 41 \n[44]Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped. \n[45]You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.

Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee. \n[52]Can I ask you a personal question?  What is it with you and Gary? Is he your boyfriend? \n[53]Do you think he is? \n[54]So there's a possibility...I mean... I.just might have a chance with you? \n[55]n here, Pete. Billy holds the tray of brownies to him. \n[56]Want some? \n[57]A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai. \n[58]I dunno, Pete... \n[59]They must only multiply with plain tap water. \n[60]Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group. \n[61]Dad...We don't know anything about these things. \n[62]Yeah, but isn't that pretty weird? I mean, if I throw water on\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney over there, we're not gonna;getjten copies. A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles. \n[63]Huh? \n[64]Oh, Christ.

Gary grabs Billy by the collar and throws him against the car. \n[67]Well, you're the closest thing this town's got to a scientist... and I need some information about an animal. \n[68]That's what I'm trying to figure out. \n[69]Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ... Roy watches with wide eyes. Suddenly, another creature bursts from Mogwai's body. NINE IDENTICAL CREATURES now stand on the desk top. \n[70]\n[71]Anything else? \n[72]Forget it. Billy stares coldly at his Father. Embarrassed, Rand looks away. \n[73]Damn things are stuck to the floor. Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled. \n[74]Why did they attack my dog? \n[75]I'm not waiting around to find out. \n[76]Screw'science. I want them des- troyed. \n[77]Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already forgotten? Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the background.     39. \n[78]Now what do we do? \n[79]I don't think we should wait. Let's do it ourselves. \n[80]Next. \n[81]Hello, Mrs. Deagle. How are you this afternoon? \n[82]\n[83]But, sir...I didn't do anything wrong. Really. \n[84]Mrs. Deagle, I...     43 \n[85]Mrs. Deagle, I... (He can't do it.

Gary smiles. Tracy is proud. \n[86]Yeah?... \n[87]Mom...stay downstairs. I'll be right home. He drops the phone and runs out of the bank. Gary exchanges a puzzled glance with Tracy. \n[88]Nervous. Sweating. Behind the wheel of his car. He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it. Outside, the sun is going down. \n[89]still driving. He tries to pass a slow truck. He hits a is spot. } \n[90]tries to start it. Nothing happens. It's stalled. \n[91]No...Not now... He tries again. No good. It's dead. Frustrated, Billy slams his fist on the steering wheel. \u00c2\u00b0 \n[92]sprints down his driveway. He arrives at the porch of his home. He opens the front door. \n[93]Mom?.. Scattered giggling echoes from inside. Billy flips on the'front hall..light.. A few tiny shadows scatter. They dash into other rooms. Afraid of the light. Billy'slowly enters. He's scared. He looks to the top of the stairs. \n[94]Mom?... More giggling. Shaking'. Nervous. Billy climbs the stairs. At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall light. Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap- ing the light. Billy spots the open attic door. He walks beneath it. He looks up into the dark attic. \n[95]Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff's Office?... \n[96]Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?... \n[97]Hello?...Hello?... \n[98]Hello?...

Several feet away, Billy so-es Mogwai The creature is on top of,Pete's body Billy rushes, to the scene. Mogwai sees Billy. The creature gets scared and dashes off.

The box is attached to a.farwall, beside. the swimming pool. \n[104]Colme on out...you bastard... It is silent again. Billy is frightened. He walks faster, moving to the light box. Billy hears another sound. He shines the light to another area. Again. Nothing. Billy starts to tremble. He runs to the light box. gets there and quickly flips open the box. Billy drops the flashlight and sword. The creature's sharp fingernails clutch onto Billy's chest. Billy falls backward, with Mogwai holding onto him. They tumble into the swimming pool. The deep end. \n[105]watches from the doorway. \n[106]Oh my God. \n[107]runs outof thegymnasium. \n[108]sits in front of the two men. A serious, helpless look covers his face.

Brent gets out of the car and walks to the building. A nervous, frustrated Billy watches. \n[117]waits in the car. Frightened. Restless. \n[118]He hears the gunshots. He moves faster, desperately hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword. \n[119]Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain. Brent's screams fade in the background. Billy looks out the side window. He sees \n[120]panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster. \n[121]finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to the driver's seat and starts the car. \n[122]drives faster. \n[123]I gotta warn people. . .1 gotta tell \n[124]steers the patrol car into the first driveway. The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He knocks. Hard. \n[125]They're coming. \n[126]You've got to keep your wind ws locked. Or better yet...boa d them up! And your lights... You've got to leave them on! f+ MR. FUTTERS What are you talking about, boy? \n[127]There are these little things... animals...They're all over the place! They'll kill you and your family!... Mr. Futters starts to laugh. \n[128]No sir, I... \n[129]Yes... \n[130]looks away. More creatures are. surrounding the car. They pound against the windows. They want in. A scared Billy flips on the police radio. \n[131]Sheriff?...It's Billy Peltzer... Can you hear me?!?... \n[132]He was kiljed by.ithe creatures. What? Whe THE POL\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdCE C AR is blanketed by creatures, trying to get in at Billy. Billy screams into the radio mike. \n[133]The creatures are all over town... breaking into houses... killing people... You've got to get help!... \n[134]starts the engine.

Up ahead, he sees \n[137]steers the police car into her driveway. He squeals to a stop. He grabs his sword and gets out of the car. \n[138]Tracy!...It's me! Billy! \n[139]I'll get him out. Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out. \n[140]He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car. \n[141]C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door. \n[142]We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet.  Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car. \n[143].and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head. \n[144]You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight.  We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods. \n[145]I did. But nobody would listen. \n[146]That's not true. \n[147]That isn't.. \n[148]Stop it. \n[149]Yeah, and then I'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad. If we can... \n[150]They're here. A frightened Gary holds Tracy. \n[151]Do you have a place without win dows?... .A place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think. \n[152]We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of the.room... \n[153]We'll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in an\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdold rocking chair. Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair. \n[154]Help me with this. Gary and Billy slide the cabinet in front of the door. \n[155]That'llkeep them out. We're safe now.. Billy sits back.

Instead,\"she walks:over to Billy. \n[157]sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound. \n[158]Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes. \n[159]Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf. \n[160]Damn. \n[161]How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away. \n[162]In this? You won't get far. \n[163]And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing. \n[164]No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms. \n[165]Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork. \n[166]It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight. \n[167]No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there. \n[168]Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark. \n[169]No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area... \n[170]You used to work here, right? \n[171]You're coming in with me., You can show me around. \n[172]Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary. \n[173]This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right? \n[174]I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy. \n[175]Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater. \n[176]They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window. \n[177]How do we get to the boiler room?     97. \n[178]Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us.  1 If we could. just distract them... Tracy perks up. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2TRAC Y- I have an 'idea'.- They look .t her . \n[179]Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out. \n[180]We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit. \n[181]Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry. More creatures come through the door. Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit.     100 \n[182]Get back here! We need you! .Gary runs out, leaving the others alone. Billy and Tracy continue to fight the creatures. \n[183]Let's go. Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting away any oncoming creatures. They hurry out of the boiler room. \n[184]You bastard. You ran out on us. Left us alone. To die. Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Punching.     \n[185]Wait... He looks out the rear window. \n[186]looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries out in that high pitched scream. \n[187]Hear that? He's calling his friends for help. They're following us. As long as he's alive and screaming... they'll come after him. \n[188]We can't kill him. He's our bait. We'll be able to lead them away from the water tower. (points to the back seat Just keep an eye on the thing... make s re it doe n' hurt us. Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview mirror. \n[189]We'd better hurry. They're getting close. They.. get into the car.. \n[190]Where in the hell?... \n[191]Check the garage... ee if there's a bag...a b x... something we can keep this little bastard locked up in. Tracyhurries to the garage. \n[192]grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed. But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy. Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside. He closes the tool box and locks it shut. Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside. Billy checks the car's engine. \n[193]Damn! He ripped out the coil wires! The car won't run without them! \n[194]There's no time. (grabs her \n[195]He lies in bed. His wounds are bandaged. An I.V. needle is in his arm.     \n[196]How's Tracy? \n[197]Oh my God! No!...No!... \n[198]The tool box! It's locked! I didn't open it!...It's dark inside!... \n[199]", "RAND": "\n[1]Hi. I'm from out of town... on business from the U.S. The woman nods and smiles. \n[2]I'm looking for a present... for my son. The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head. \n[3]He's not really involved in sports... The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony \"Walkman\". Rand again shakes his head., \n[4]No. I want something unusual... something he can't get at home... something different..   .2. \n[5]What is it? \n[6]Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account is definite. MmmHmm. My plane l eaves in twenty minutes. See you in Pennsylvania. He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check- in counter. \n[7]What does it mean? \n[8]Is anybody home? Lynn stands and whispers to Billy. \n[9]Billy .. , Billy walks to his Father. They embrace. \n[10]Not now. I've got a surprise for both of you. Come on. He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange a puzzled glance. They follow Rand. \n[11]Your new pet. \n[12]He's singing. \n[13]Barney! Be a good dog and go up- stairs! Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits. Lynn stares at Mogwai. \n[14]Hold him. \n[15]C'mon. He won't bite. Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son. \n[16]He likes you. Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands. \n[17]We know they're cute.. We know..\" they're intelligent. And now we know they multiply by water. \n[18]All I know, is that I've got a million dollars sitting in my lap. \n[19]I'm going to market these things. \n[20]Just imagine the excitement when word gets out. Everyone will want a Mogwai of their very own. \n[21]No. If we want to make a big profit, we have to move:fast I have some investors coming over to the house on Thursday.

Skeptical. \n[22]This should keep them out for the rest of the niht... \n[23]Tomorrow we'll take them out in the sun... \n[24].and.finish them off. Lynn nods. Rand looks at Billy. \n[25]I'm sorry, son. I never expected to... \n[26]We should all get back to sleep. Rand puts his arm around Lynn. They walk to their bed- room. Billy looks up at the attic door. The creatures' scratching is heard. \n[27]What in the hell?... Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things. Won't budge. Hard as a rock. \n[28]How long until they hatch? \n[29]Billy ...Maybe Mr. Hanson's got a point... \n[30]Not even warm. (shakes his head, \n[31]I get back from Seattle on Wednesday. I'll call some con- struction people. They'll come in next week and cut these things out of the floor. \n[32]No. It's late. I've got an early plane to catch.  The attic door is locked. There are no windows up here. Nothing can get in or out. Rand pats Billy on the back. \n[33]Son, you've got to stop worrying. \n[34]It's okay, Billy...It's over... Billy holds his Father tightly. \n[35]Billy?...What is it?... \n[36]What?... Billy jumps out of bed. He tears the I.V. out of his arm. He opens the closet and starts to get dressed.

They exit the police station. \n[11]Hey, C'mon... \n[12]But this is an emergency. We gotta warn everybody! The gremlins are coming! Gary laughs. Frank sighs \n[13]So when are you gonna make me Deputy? \n[14]Why don't you fire Brent. He's nothin' but a drunk. I'could do a lot better. They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some- thing up ahead. He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on houses. Running across the front lawns. Frank motions for Gary to slow down. \n[15]What.about my brother?

He rests the sword beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive., Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort.

Now. \n[25]I'll walk. \n[26]Not bad, Peltzer. I-didn't know you could cook.     94. \n[27]It's a big place. No windows. \n[28]When I was a kid. \n[29]In the basement. \n[30]That leads outside.

It's beautiful. \n[3]I got most of the rust off...But there were a couple spots that wouldn't budge. Billy runs his finger along the blade. \n[4]Careful. It's sharp. A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the sword. \n[5]Two hundred. You can pay me twenty a week. Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry. Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his arm. \n[6]My pleasure, son. Billy and Pete exit the store. \n[7]comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.     84. \n[8]What the hell happened to you? Billy looks at Dorry. \n[9]Hard to believe. Like Satan's come to walk the earth. \n[10]Nowt boys...arguing won't get us anywhere.

No one disagrees. Tracy suddenly notices something. She cries out. \n[14]I've only been this scared two other times in my life. Once was when I got drafted. The other, was when I was six years old.  It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters and I were decorating the tree with our Mother. We were singing caroles...happy ...excited... waiting for Dad to get home from work.  A few hours passed, and we started to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My Mother called the office. They said he left.  After about a week... the police gave up. My Mother was close to a nervous breakdown... The rest of us weren't eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every- thing was falling apart.  It was snowing outside. The house was cold. I threw some logs on the fire.--..That's when I noticed the smell.  The firemen came. They broke through the chimney top. We were all waiting, expecting them to pull out some dead cat or bird... Instead, they pulled out my Father.  He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit. He had been climbing down the chimney on Christmas Eve, his arms loaded with presents. \n[15]He was going to surprise us.  The coroner said that he lost his footing. He slipped and broke his neck. Died instantly. His body was lodged in the narrow chimney shaft.  ,That how I found out there was no Sahta Claus. Everyone has a chilled look on their faces. Dorry just stares. Billy stands and clears his throat.. \n[16]\n[17]Phone's. dead. \n[18]Could there be other people in town? Alive? \n[19]How about somebody's garage?... Or tool shed?... \n[20]Always dark. Pitch black. Billy nods to himself.

Your Father's coming home tonight. \n[7]It'll put him in a bad mood. \n[8]Billy, honey... \n[9]Dad and I just don't want you to have to struggle like we did. We want to help, until you can support yourself as a writer. \n[10]It'll get published. \n[11]If it takes that long, yes. \n[12]Please, let's forget about this. Just for tonight. Okay? Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods. Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited \".hello\". They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms. Billy just sits. Burning.     20. \n[13]I think he's just darling. Mogwai. Rand holds the creature out to Billy.     22 \n[14]You two look so cute together. I have to take a picture. Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a Kodak Instamatic. Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy hates it. \n[15]Okay smile. Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek. Lynn snaps the picture. Flash! Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's cheek. \n[16]slowly moves to the kitch n doorway. Sh listens. \n[17]jumps at the noise.

She climbs theladder, into the attic. ", "PETE": "\n[1]Thanks. That'd be nice. Billy helps Pete pick up his schoolbooks. \n[2]Wow... Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of \"Once And Future King\". \n[3]Hey, Billy...You know so much about Vikings and stuff...You should write one of these stories yourself.     14. \n[4]Really? \n[5]Sounds gre t. When can I read it? \n[6]Hello? Is anybody home? \n[7]What's in there? Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback. \n[8]What is it? \n[9]It's neat. Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie and starts to eat.     28. \n[10]Hey, Billy.. .You think I might be able to borrow it? Just for a night? \n[11]C'mon...My Mom will never know. I'll hide it under my bed. Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily knocks over the water bottle. A few drops of water splash Mogwai. The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched scream. Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared. Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble... .expand...' Billy can't believe his eyes. Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more, getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode. Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated. The spots burst. \n[12]\n[13]Now can I have one? \n[14]Maybe I won't take one. The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling. \n[15]Mr. Hanson...this is my friend Billy. He wants to talk to you about somethin'. \n[16]Yeah...that's what happened when I tried to take one. \n[17]stands in the back row, wearing his orange down jacket and a long checkered scarf. He stands in the back row, singing tenor. \n[18]is being dragged from the group by his checkered scarf. Mogwai pulls the youth into a nearby wooded area. Pete kicks and shouts. But the caroler's singing drowns out his cries for help. Mogwai jumps onto Pete's chest. The creature's razor sharp teeth bite into the boy's neck, tearing out a huge chunk. Pete screams. No one hears. ", "FRANK": "\n[1]\n[2]These little things killed your Mother and the Fountane boy? Billy nods. \n[3]And they eat human flesh? \n[4]Looks like a dog. \n[5]Look, Billy...We all know that you have a very active imagination. My brother told me about the books you read down there at the bank ...Now, Dungeons and Dragons are fine if you're five years old, but... Billy stands.
