{"dialogues": {"SARA": "\n[1]Hi. Sara Matthews. She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple silver chain around her neck. \n[2]Told you we'd make it. She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles off the other cart. \n[3]Sara. 3. Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands. \n[4]Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met this really cool biker? He's taking me to Mexico this weekend. Hello? Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding. Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a work/study ad on the wall. \n[5]Everything's great. No, she's not here yet so I got to choose my side of the room. She tears a tab off the flyer. \n[6]Psi U.? \n[7]I don't know... I might just hang and wait for my roommate. Groans all around. \"Come on\"... \"Lame-O\"... Sara bites her lip, considering. She smiles. \n[8]Alright. Just let me change. The girls cheer. \n[9]What's the point? Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard. Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage, but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large room. A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good, but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and watches them. In particular -- THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He definitely stands out. Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band. Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her. 6. \n[10]To this? \n[11]Crap. Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around. \n[12]Where's Tracy? \n[13]Uh oh. Guys yell out. \"Show em.\" Several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd. \n[14]Tracy. Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd. 7. \n[15]Tracy. Don't. Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara gasps. \n[16]I have to go clean this up. She turns. \n[17]What plan? \n[18]You spilled beer on me purposely? \n[19]I'll get over it. He laughs, making her smile. 8. \n[20]I'm not sure how she's so wasted. All she's had is punch. Stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand. \n[21]It's pretty good. She drinks some more. \n[22]It doesn't taste that strong. \n[23]Sara. \n[24]Hey, why do you get to drink beer? \n[25]Old man. 9. \n[26]Ugh. You're in this frat? He jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her. Sara laughs as she notices Kim, dancing, Holding up a cup of punch. \n[27]What happened to Tracy? Kim shrugs. \n[28]I got her. 10. She struggles to hold Tracy up -- the girl's heavier than she looks and Sara's balance is not so great, herself. The frat boys notice her struggling. \n[29]Who's got you? Stephen looks at Tracy in one arm. The other arm around Sara's waist. \n[30]No problem. They linger, smiling, checking out Stephen... They step into the elevator. Holding it for Sara. \n[31]Do you want to come up? \n[32]Thanks again. For everything. And, sorry about kitchen duty. He smiles... and walks away into the night. Sara looks after him... and now it's her turn to take a deep breath which suddenly makes her a little more queasy. \n[33]Ow! She reaches her bed and plops down on her back. Breathing hard. Clenching her eyes shut. The room is spinning. She may puke at any second. She struggles to sit up. She fumbles for the lamp next to her bed, almost knocking it over. She hits the switch, revealing: The other bed. Sara screams. \n[34]Who are you?! \n[35]What are you doing? \n[36]Why? Rebecca shrugs. Sara grabs her stomach. \n[37]Oh shit. Her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door. Rebecca smiles. 13. \n[38]Rebecca? No answer. Sara makes it back to her bed. She falls onto it, and turns toward the wall. Rebecca's eyes open. And they stay open. She watches Sara go to sleep. \n[39]Right...  Starts with a... \"T\"? \n[40]Thanks. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. \n[41]I didn't throw up on you, did I? \n[42]Did you do those? Rebecca nods. \n[43]They're really cool. \n[44]Rebecca -- did you take my picture last night? 15. \n[45]It's too damn early for me. \n[46]Holy shit! \n[47]Nice bag. Dior? \n[48]I'm on financial aid. 16. \n[49]Jason. What are you doing? \n[50]I told you not to do this. \n[51]You're just making it harder. \n[52]But you didn't come out here, remember. That's the problem. She says it too loud. Other students in line are eyeing her. \n[53]I've gotta go. Sara hangs up. She exhales, flustered. \n[54]Ex. Off Rebecca's confused look. 17. \n[55]It's complicated. A beat. Rebecca's warm smile makes Sara want to open up. They walk along the stacks of books. \n[56]We dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together. We both applied to Brown. I got in; he got wait-listed. I stuck to our agreement and we both committed here. Then two weeks ago...a spot opened up at Brown ...and.. \n[57]Yep. \n[58]Sometimes I think I do. \n[59]Oh my God. \n[60]I am so jealous. \n[61]No problem. \n[62]Jesus, some of these I've only ever seen in Vogue. \n[63]Oh, you here? \n[64]That's cool. You can go home on weekends. Free laundry. Free meals. \n[65]Can I take a look? She walks over. Rebecca clutches the pad to her chest. \n[66]Sure. \n[67]I am. I want to be well-rounded.  And they're requirements. 20. \n[68]Hey. Tracy... Kim... this is my roommate, Rebecca. She turns, but Rebecca is standing at a distance. Sara waves her over. Rebecca comes, reluctantly. She flashes a small wave. \n[69]I like Becca. Tracy's grimace vetoes that one, too. \n[70]Becky's good. The girls all turn to Rebecca for approval. \n[71]Professor Roberts? He flashes a disarming smile. \n[72]I'm sorry to bother you, it's just... I absolutely must take this class. \n[73]But you're not teaching them. I want to learn from the best. He smiles at her. \n[74]Sara Matthews. I brought a request form. on Sara. Roaming over her. \n[75]No, I guess it wouldn't. Thanks anyway. She walks toward the door. Roberts' eyes go to her ass. \n[76]Hey. Rebecca removes her earbud. \n[77]What's your Facebook page? I'll add you as a friend. \n[78]Myspace? \n[79]Come here. Rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over Sara's shoulder. 24. ON COMPUTER SCREEN: Sara's Facebook Page. Her picture in the corner. Pictures and posts from a dozen friends. Among them: A STYLISH, ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 20s. \n[80]Irene. She graduated from the Art Institute out here last year. \n[81]A design apprentice for Marc Jacobs. Hey, check out these posts. Sara scrolls down Irene's recent posts: \"Paris was amazing\"... \"Milan in the Fall\"... \"Off to Barcelona\"... etc. \n[82]I mean.. .who doesn't have a Facebook page?! Rebecca laughs. \n[83]Of course. \n[84]No shit! They clink their empty glasses in a toast. \n[85]Can I? She puts her wallet and cell phone into Tracy's purse. \n[86]Don't be mean. \n[87]She's just a little hard to get to know. \n[88]What do you think? \n[89]Tracy? 27. \n[90]Tracy. She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck. She starts walking down the street, away from the club. Weary and unnerved. \n[91]Nice car. \n[92]No idea, I couldn't find her. Rebecca sits down, dropping her purse and keys on the table. \n[93]Starved. Sara smiles gratefully. Rebecca opens the menu. 30. \n[94]I know. Thanks for coming. Rebecca looks up from the menu. \n[95]Deal. \n[96]Okay, I have no idea what this is supposed to be. \n[97]Amazing. I love it. \n[98]That is so cool. \n[99]Sure. \"Bobby loves Jenny. Chrissy loves Rick.\" Nothing like this. Rebecca pulls out her camera. \n[100]Both of us. 32. They both hold the camera, extended at arm's length. Rebecca clicks. She looks at the picture. She can see the tattoo parlor in the background. \n[101]I have a tattoo. Rebecca smiles. Yeah, right. But she can see in Sara's eyes that she's serious. \n[102]My older sister. She died when I was nine. \n[103]This keeps her with me. \n[104]Guess who I'm listing as my favorite artist on my Facebook page? Richard Prince. Rebecca smiles, genuinely touched. She walks over to check out the rest of Sara's Facebook Favorites. Favorite book, favorite band, etc. 33. \n[105]Don't laugh. It's about a small town girl making it in the big city. \n[106]Hey there. 34. The kitten purrs. \n[107]Look at you. She kneels and pets it. The kitten purrs. \n[108]No collar, baby? Sara glances around to see if anyone is watching. \n[109]Wow. \n[110]I know, I know. It's stupid, and I've just broken about forty different dorm rules, and I should just take it to a shelter... \n[111]Really? 35. \n[112]I named her in the elevator. Cuddles. She smiles and scoops her up. Suddenly, her smile vanishes. \n[113]Is that my necklace? Rebecca touches it. She'd forgotten she still had it on. \n[114]This was my sister's. \n[115]You can borrow anything of mine. Except for this. Okay? It's the only thing I kept of hers. Rebecca nods. Sara sits down on the bed next to her. \n[116]It's okay. You didn't know. \n[117]Yeah. You're the first roommate I've had since she died. So, it feels a little odd. 36. \n[118]A good way. \n[119]You wanted a mocha smoothie, right? O.K. Do you know what's in that? The kid shrugs. Sara hops to the blender and guesses some ingredients. She starts it up. She takes her hand off the lid, and... THE BLENDER EXPLODES, splashing mocha smoothie all over her apron. She's frozen in shock. The co-worker casually hands her a towel. She snatches it. She turns to find... STEPHEN, standing at the front of the line. \n[120]Just because I kissed you doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line. \n[121]I.. dunno. I'm still having flashbacks from the last one. Sara laughs. \n[122]Hey. \n[123]So you can ditch me again? \n[124]That's your apology? Tracy jumps up and walks over. 38. \n[125]I forgive you. Tracy gives her a big, exaggerated hug. Over Sara's shoulder, she spots Rebecca looking at them. Tracy flashes a big smile. Relief at making up with Sara. But that's not how Rebecca takes it. \n[126]But you're on your own at Psi U. Because... Someone has a date. Rebecca hears this. She slips back into the room and closes the door. Sara turns and walks down the hallway. \n[127]You look... nice. \n[128]Actually, I... sort of have a date? \n[129]You know, I could reschedule. 39. \n[130]I want to. On one condition... Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow. Rebecca smiles. \n[131]What are you, a label whore?! Who cares ...I got it at a flea market and it looks great with the dress. Rebecca nods in agreement. \n[132]It just needs one last touch... She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand. \n[133]I'm gonna jump in the shower, then we'll head out. She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door. Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced. She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation... SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear. \n[134]Hey. How was the party? Are you still the beer bong queen? But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop. \n[135]What do you mean? \n[136]Doing what? \n[137]Are you sure? 42. \n[138]No, it's just... why would she do that? \n[139]Fashion's something you can buy, but style you either have or you don't. 43. \n[140]But it can buy you a good stylist. The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles. \n[141]Hey. How'd you know when my class got out? Rebecca shrugs, playing it off. \n[142]Thanks. \n[143]Listen... Tracy told me something kinda weird. She says you... scared her this morning. Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing. \n[144]Yeah. 44. \n[145]The girl does like to party. Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it. Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from Irene: \"where r u?!?!?!\" \n[146]I gotta go meet Irene.  Thanks for the coffee. Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip. \n[147]I so want to be you when I grow up. 45. \n[148]Oh god. I hope you told him I'm closing down the library every night. \n[149]Perfect. \n[150]Sorry again. Actually, how about dinner tonight? \n[151]Page two? Busted! 46. \n[152]Then let's make sure it was worth it. She gives him a slow, lingering kiss. \n[153]Anytime. He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca. Standing just five feet away. Staring at them. \n[154]Oh, hi. \n[155]Oh. I turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on. Rebecca... this is Stephen. He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him. \n[156]Well, she's right...I shoulda called. He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss. The doors close. Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door and sighs. \n[157]I guess I'll see you later. \n[158]You don't need to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Okay? Rebecca slowly nods. \n[159]I'm already her best friend? \n[160]Stop. But the look on her face says she agrees. \n[161]I don't. He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively. \n[162]You... are...a...moron. He grins. \n[163]The question is \"whose home?\" \n[164]I'll make you a bet. I go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate. \n[165]Why'd you agree? \n[166]Making me laugh isn't going to help you. They stare each other down. She's stifling a laugh, much more in control as Stephen is straining. 54. He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him fall. She then lets go, victorious. \n[167]I was a gymnast until I hit a growth spurt my freshman year. Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was \"this close\". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful shove. \n[168]So I win. He gives her a playful shove back. \n[169]So...let's go back to your place. She gives him a seductive grin. \n[170]You're kidding. 56. But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him. Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard. \n[171]I'm going to start taking my clothes off out here. \n[172]Oops! There goes my shirt... She's got his attention now. He speeds up. \n[173]There go the jeans. He's popping breath mints... while clearing off his bed. \n[174]Hmmm. What's next? Top or bottom? Stephen stops and stares at the door. \n[175]Who do we have here? Hey guys! Let me ask you. Bra or panties? Bra? Okay, okay. Just calm down. The door swings open. Stephen stands in front of her, grinning. \n[176]Hey. Sorry I didn't call. I forgot my phone. \n[177]A nice girl doesn't kiss and tell. They laugh. A nice, easy vibe between them. 59. \n[178]You want to go get some breakfa-- Before she can finish, Cuddles bolts out the door and down the hallway. \n[179]Oh no. Sara chases after her as Rebecca gets up from her bed. \n[180]Maybe... \n[181]Yes. Sara walks back to her room. Rebecca stands in the doorway. They exchange despondent looks. Screwed. \n[182]I walked. 60. \n[183]It's ten bucks for a cab and I'm a student. \n[184]Duh? \n[185]What?! \n[186]Hey. Oh, Hi. Yeah, I'm over at Irene's. I meant to leave you a note. Uh huh, uh huh, oh! That's a good idea. Let me check, hold on. Sara covers the phone and turns to Irene. \n[187]Do you like cats? \n[188]We have to get rid of one. \n[189]You're right.  No, she can't. Huh? Oh I don't know... whenever I get there. Bye. \n[190]My roommate. More than a little overprotective. \n[191]So, where is it? \n[192]You said you had a surprise for me? \n[193]You're kidding, all of these?! Oh no. \n[194]We have no closet space at the dorms. Rebecca's already using half of mine. \n[195]What? \n[196]Seriously? \n[197]Huh. Let me talk to Rebecca about it. \n[198]We broke up. \n[199]Irene gave them to me. She had a lot more but we don't have the room. \n[200]Well, maybe that's not a problem. \n[201]Yeah. She actually suggested that I move in with her. \n[202]No, of course not. I love living here... with you. Sara smiles as she sits down next to Rebecca, trying to put a bright spin on things. \n[203]Look, I'd still technically be living here. So you wouldn't have to get a new roommate. Her place is huge and it's not like you couldn't use the extra closet space. I'd just move some of my stuff over, and spend a few nights a week there. We'd both have a lot more space. \n[204]Nothing's set in stone. It's just something to think about. Plus we'd be able to keep Cuddles. As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares across the room at... Cuddles. \n[205]Tracy! Tracy slows for a split-second, then keeps walking. As if she didn't hear anything. Sara hurries to catch up with her. 64. \n[206]Tracy... hey. \n[207]I heard you changed dorms. \n[208]Well, we should get together. Like grab a bite or something. Right? \n[209]Hi. Rebecca starts to walk over to Tracy and Sara. \n[210]Tracy?! \n[211]I don't know. She just walked away. \n[212]Hey. I do so call, Mom. Geez. Her latte customer rolls his eyes. Moms. He takes his drink and walks away. \n[213]Well, actually, I was thinking I'd do Thanksgiving here and see you guys for Christmas. She listens, her face telling us that she doesn't like what she's hearing. \n[214]Ya know what, I'm at work, and I'm really getting slammed... There isn't another customer in sight. \n[215]I'll call you later, okay? Tell Dad I said hello. Bye. She hangs up the phone and sighs. \n[216]Hey, what's wrong? Rebecca looks up at her, eyes red. Ashamed. \n[217]Oh no. In the dorm? \n[218]What?! \n[219]Maybe she'll come back. \n[220]I'm going to go find her. \n[221]Maybe it's... just karma or something. We weren't allowed to keep her anyway. \n[222]It was an accident. It's just... stress after stress, you know? 68. \n[223]My parents really want me to come home for Thanksgiving. \n[224]It's not exactly the most festive holiday in the Matthews household. Emily died two days before Thanksgiving. A beat. Rebecca pats Sara's hand. \n[225]I know I should be there with them, but it's like there's a ghost at the table. \n[226]What? Rebecca sits up, her excitement growing. \n[227]Your folks wouldn't mind? \n[228]Okay, we'll see. Thanks. 69. \n[229]Sure. I've got a class right now. But I'll come right after it. \n[230]I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying what I think you're saying? \n[231]Of course. I'll do... anything. Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the quad... and now turns back to Sara. \n[232]Okay... He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks into her eyes. \n[233]Sometimes. 71. \n[234]I can't believe you just did that. \n[235]I better go. Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door... \n[236]My design professor just kissed me. Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next to Sara. \n[237]Yeah, it just really creeped me out. And I think the asshole's married. 72. Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's. \n[238]What? \n[239]Yeah, sure. 77. She smiles. Stephen smiles back. Sara looks down in her book again. \n[240]What happened? \n[241]Remember what I told you about Professor Roberts? \n[242]He's gone. \n[243]Well, they're calling it a leave of absence. But what I heard... someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student. \n[244]I know. \n[245]Lemme hear it. \n[246]No. Really? Why? \n[247]Why would you say that? \n[248]You're right. You guys do suck. A beat. \n[249]Hold it. Did you just say girlfriend? \n[250]So you think it'll be fun to stay here during Thanksgiving? \n[251]Sounds like a blast. \n[252]Oh my God. What happened? She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms. \n[253]Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe now. Talk to me. \n[254]It's okay. It's okay. Shhh. \n[255]You're alright now. Sara notices a streak of blood against Rebecca's shirt. She pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps. \n[256]It's not deep, thank God. But you should see a doctor. \n[257]Rebecca, you need to. And then the police. 81. Rebecca pulls back on her bed, ruining the gauze job. \n[258]You're calling them, or I am. There's a psycho walking around this campus. \n[259]Okay, okay. I won't call. Just let me help you. Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently as she works. \n[260]Sorry about not staying. But, Rebecca... \n[261]Just say you'll miss me. \n[262]I haven't heard from Jason in weeks. It's weird how he just stopped calling. \n[263]Yeah. Yeah it is. Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile. \n[264]This is your home? \n[265]I'm Sara. She puts out her hand, but cuts Rebecca a look. You didn't tell them? \n[266]You didn't tell them we were coming? \n[267]These are interesting. \n[268]Rebecca's a pretty great artist. \n[269]She's an awesome roommate, too. \n[270]Sure. Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back. Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed. \n[271]Next Thanksgiving, you can run interference with my family. \n[272]Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some of her high school hangouts. \n[273]Uhhh, yeah. I think she is. 88. \n[274]Medication? Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs. Did she hear them? She walks down. \n[275]Yeah. It's just... She wants to ask her about that medication. \n[276]Nice to see where you come from. \n[277]Thanks. The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out. What's she doing with Rebecca? The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work. \n[278]You know them? \n[279]Friends? Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye contact with the Brunette. The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves. Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance. As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible. The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances at Rebecca as they order their drinks. Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls. Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette. Suddenly, Rebecca gets up. \n[280]Well, we better go. Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as they open the door... \n[281]Come on, let's go. \n[282]I guess college is a fresh start for both of us. Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement on her face. Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara looks at the text message she just received from Irene: \"back in LA. lemme know abt movin in.\" \n[283]Irene's back in town. Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her. \n[284]Great. You wanna go get dinner? \n[285]Oh. Okay. Catch you later then. 92. \n[286]Oh my God. \n[287]That's what I intend to find out. \n[288]APD -- anti-social personality disorder. Also known as sociopathy. They look at each other. \n[289]It says lithium can control the condition.  Maybe these are refills. Maybe she's been taking it all along. \n[290]I think it's time I moved in with Irene. \n[291]Hey yourself. Where were you all night? 97. \n[292]\n[293]Uhhh... \n[294]Um... sure. Okay. \n[295]You can't rush this, Rebecca. We can always come back. \n[296]Okay. I'm out here if you need me. Sara sits down as the TATTOO ARTIST escorts Rebecca upstairs. She looks giddy and nervous. Sara waves. When she's gone, Sara takes out her phone and texts Irene. 98. \n[297]Let's see it. Rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal, just under her collarbone: \n[298]I'll get the rest of my things when Irene comes back to town. He takes the box. Then notices -- \n[299]I can't find it. It's okay. \n[300]I'm not going back up there. He hands her the box. Time to man up. \n[301]And tell them what? What has she really done to me? No one can do anything. It's the weirdest thing, Stephen. The girl's own parents are afraid of her. 101. \n[302]Are these dirty or clean? Stephen sniffs the shirts. \n[303]Seriously. Is it a game to be as loud as you possibly can? She waves her arms like a crazy person. \n[304]How many walls can you possibly bump into!? They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut. \n[305]Hey, I'm going to hit the library. \n[306]No, it's okay. \n[307]I hear the drummer's really hot. \n[308]Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping by Irene's, come on by. I want you Grand, Apt. 708. Love you. He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens. \n[309]Irene? \n[310]Irene? There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes. CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees. The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above... Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth. Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock. \n[311]Irene. Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts toward Irene... \n[312]Rebecca! Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara. \n[313]Rebecca, you are my friend. 110. \n[314]Rebecca, I'm sorry-- \n[315]What're you talking about? What'd you do to them? What'd you do to Jason? \n[316]Rebecca, please forgive me. A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up. \n[317]Rebecca... \n[318]No! Don't! Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her... \n[319]Please. Don't do this... Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die. She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun. \n[320]Shit! \n[321]Ohgodohgodohgod. The more she screams, the more she loses her grip. 114. \n[322]Stephen! Help! \n[323]Stephen. Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes violently in her hand. Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on the floor. \n[324]Rebecca. We were never friends. That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from the floor, and slams her against the wall. She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns red. Redder... But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock. Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's shoulder blades. Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees... Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self- consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out and grabs Sara's hand. Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from around Rebecca's neck. Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything. \n[325]Stephen. Hold on. She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911. He looks into her eyes and smiles. She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes. \n[326]Hey. How are you feeling? Stephen enters the room. \n[327]Just got here. \n[328]Actually, I need you right here, right now. Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed. \n[329]Now I can get settled in. \n[330]Absolutely. Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her eyes before she goes back into her room. ", "REBECCA": "\n[1]Taking your picture. \n[2]Hey Sara. Sara stares at her blankly. Who is this girl? What happened last night? Rebecca smiles. \n[3]We met last night. 14. \n[4]Close. Rebecca. She hands Sara a glass of water and two aspirin. \n[5]Come on. It'll help, trust me. Sara washes down the aspirin. \n[6]No. You made it to the bathroom. Sara looks around the room. Her lounge chair has been moved to her side. Rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall.. .They're various self-portraits of Rebecca. Sara looks at one where Rebecca is staring straight back at us. No smile. \n[7]I just like capturing my moods. A beat. Sara closes her eyes. Bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now. \n[8]Yeah. It's just something I do. For my drawings. C'mon, let's hit the bookstore. The walk will help your head. Sara rolls over, groaning. \n[9]It's three in the afternoon. Sara's eyes bug out. \n[10]That didn't sound good. Boyfriend? \n[11]No?! He took it?  What an asshole. \n[12]Do you miss him? \n[13]It's hard to let go. Believe me, I know. But, you're in college now. A girl's gotta move on. Sara smiles, glad to find a kindred spirit. She looks at her phone... and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the register. \n[14]What? 18. Sara walks to the closet. Her modest clothes hang on one side. But the other side is now taken up by Rebecca's KILLER \n[15]I know... I've got a lot of clothes. Mind if I put some on your side? \n[16]Borrow anything you want. Really. I haven't worn half of them. Sara reverently fingers through them. Chloe. De La Renta. Alexander McQueen. Jimmy Choo shoes. A Miu Miu handbag. Some still carry their price tags. \n[17]My parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in Beverly Hills with a Platinum card. \n[18]Pasadena. Off Sara's confused look. \n[19]About 20 minutes away. \n[20]Not gonna happen. Sara gives her a puzzled stare. 19. \n[21]It's a long story.. .Let's just say nothing's free in my house. She wants to know more... but it's too soon to pry. She nods at Rebecca's drawing pad. \n[22]No. Sara stops dead in her tracks. Rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh. \n[23]Not till it's done. Nothing personal. It's just my... process. I wouldn't want to show you anything unless it was perfect. \n[24]I thought you were a design major. Why are you taking Calc and psychology? The girls get up with their trays. \n[25]Hi. \n[26]I like Rebecca. Buzzkill. \n[27]I don't have a Facebook page. \n[28]Nope. I don't spend a lot of time \n[29]Who's she? \n[30]She's an artist? \n[31]Okay, okay. I'll get one. Tracy knocks on the partially open front door... and marches right in. \n[32]I don't. \n[33]I'll pass. Clubs really aren't my scene. Tracy stands there, hung out to dry, the ID in her hand. \n[34]Hello? \n[35]Yes. She smiles. \n[36]I'm fine. Just in a hurry. She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her, treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the \"Full Service\" sign. \n[37]All done. She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face. \n[38]Sorry. But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range. \n[39]Sorry again. Rick. The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter. Rick's pissed. Charges towards her. \n[40]Pussy. She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in gasoline. \n[41]Thanks. So, where's Tracy? \n[42]As long as I'm here... you hungry? \n[43]I can't believe she ran out on you. \n[44]Tracy had her shot tonight. Tomorrow you're all mine. I'll show you the big city.. .the right way. And I promise I won't abandon you. Deal? Sara smiles. \n[45]These are the modern pieces. A little wilder than the old stuff. She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed. Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: \"Jason\". She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She buries her cell phone in her purse. Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it. \n[46]Even I don't get that one. Come on, I want to show you something. \n[47]This is my favorite. Sara steps closer to examine it. Rebecca stays behind her. \n[48]I love how he captures her personality through her eyes. It's like she really wants to help you. Rebecca's hands tug anxiously at her shirt. She really wants Sara to like this painting. Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister. Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's hopeful expression. Sara brightens. \n[49]No graffiti in Des Moines? \n[50]Hey, smile. Sara poses... but now grabs Rebecca and pulls her in. \n[51]Now that's one \"art form\" I don't get. Needles into skin? No thanks. \n[52]Really? Sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal, over her heart, a simple tattoo: \"Emily\". \n[53]Oh, I'm sorry. \n[54]I always wanted a sister. Sara smiles and interlocks her arm with Rebecca's as they walk down the street. \n[55]Your favorite movie is \"Coyote Ugly\"? \n[56]Isn't every movie?! They both laugh. \n[57]I thought you'd like it. Rebecca sees the moving bulge under Sara's jacket. She cuts Sara a look. Sara sighs. Apprehensively, she unzips her jacket and the kitten pops out. Rebecca sits up. The kitten jumps over to her bed. She pets it. \n[58]Sara... \n[59]What do you want to name it? Sara's face lights up. She smiles gratefully. \n[60]It'll be our secret. Just between us. Rebecca keeps petting the kitten. Getting more attached. \n[61]Sorry. I was just trying it on. Sara puts down the kitten and walks to Rebecca, who quickly takes it off. Sara takes it back, annoyed. She rubs it protectively. \n[62]Oh. Sara looks at it a moment longer. She looks at Rebecca. \n[63]I'm really sorry. \n[64]Were you two close? \n[65]In a good way or a bad way? Sara smiles. \n[66]Thanks. Richard Prince is having a showing. I bought two tickets. Since he's your favorite artist... \n[67]Oh. Okay. Major downer. Rebecca goes back to getting dressed. Heavy silence in the room. Sara watches her. A beat. \n[68]You don't have to. \n[69]I love it, who's the designer? \n[70]I'm your roommate. Sara smiles and grabs a cup. \n[71]What? \n[72]It's more like she scared me. She was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl. She almost knocked me over. A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles. \n[73]So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me tell you what I think. I think you're a little whore, and a bad influence on her. And I think that if you tell anyone about... what I'm about to do... you'll regret it. Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further. Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain. A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face. Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor, Rebecca looks down at... The bloody ring in her hand. \n[74]Nice belly ring. She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away. \n[75]Where were you? \n[76]I kept calling and calling. \n[77]I'm going to bed now. I'm glad you're okay. She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara bites her lip, as if to say: \"What can you do?\" 50. \n[78]Sara... Last night. I was just worried about you. \n[79]Sara. We're good, right? A beat. Sara nods and smiles. \n[80]Stephen. Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He keeps going, scanning the book numbers again. \n[81]Mmmm? 55. \n[82]I miss you. She moves her hand across her stomach. \n[83]I want you, Jason. \n[84]I miss touching you. Do you miss touching me? \n[85]Prove it. \n[86]Say my name, Jason. Until I tell you to stop. She puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow beside her. Both her hands ease back under the covers. \n[87]Don't ever call me again. She kills the call. And now deletes it from the phone log. \n[88]Well, good morning. \n[89]No problem. Sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone. She quickly checks. No calls. Rebecca looks Sara over and smiles. \n[90]Come on...don't I get any details?? \n[91]Hey. What're those? \n[92]Too bad she couldn't take Cuddles, huh? \n[93]Really? 63. \n[94]What? You want to move? \n[95]I don't want more space. I want... She checks herself. A beat of awkward silence. \n[96]Sara! Sara turns and waves at Rebecca. \n[97]What was that about? \n[98]Well, she's always been a flake. 65. \n[99]Looks like it's just you and me tonight. \n[100]See how nice and warm it is in there? Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth. Rebecca closes the door and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass. She gently pushes the start button, just enough to get the dryer moving for a sec. Cuddles stumbles, falls over, and gets back up. Rebecca pushes the button again, a little longer this time. Cuddles stumbles. Flips over. The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca, wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her last quarter. She gently places it in the slot. ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the glass at the kitten. She fingers the button. Before she pushes it -- \n[101]Cuddles got out. 67. \n[102]Outside. \n[103]I was doing laundry... I took her with me... She jumped out of the bag and ran outside. I went after her, but... I'm so sorry. Sara stands, pissed. She wants to really go off on Rebecca... but the girl's so distraught, so fragile. \n[104]She won't. \n[105]Do you want me to help? But Sara's already gone, slamming the door behind her. \n[106]You're not mad at me? \n[107]Is something else wrong? A beat as Sara decides whether to confide. \n[108]You don't want to go? \n[109]You can come with me. \n[110]Yeah, spend Thanksgiving at my house. \n[111]Please. Like they'd even notice. \n[112]What's wrong? \n[113]Are you alright? Sara nods. \n[114]Professor Roberts? \n[115]I'm glad I caught you. \n[116]Not yet. That's why I'm here. 73. She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner is disarming. A beat. \n[117]I'm failing Intro Pysch. \n[118]Because I'm bored. I thought it would be all about Freud, and deep dark secrets. But it's brain chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay awake in class. \n[119]Tomorrow's the last day to drop a course without penalty. Unless I can add another one in its place, I'll fall way behind in credits. Daddy won't take that very well. He might even pull the plug. Which means... I'm pretty much at your mercy, Professor. Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's \n[120]Do I look like just any student to you? She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus. She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it up. \n[121]Your wife is very pretty. 74. \n[122]Ask me anything. He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey. \n[123]None. \n[124]Only one thing. \n[125]I definitely look better out of them than in them. What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in Still steady. \n[126]Great. Just tell me and I'll do anything. \n[127]Ow! You're hurting me! Professor, stop!... Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her. What's going on? Rebecca smiles again. This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her again... She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which rolls away across the floor. Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him. \n[128]Birthday gift. You should get one, they're great. She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior conversation, played back. \n[129]Oh, I'm not teasing. She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the floor. 76. \n[130]Do you see enough danger in me now, Professor? Did I go to a dark enough place for you? He recognizes his own words to Sara. \n[131]She trusted you. She walks toward the door. \n[132]Yes you will. She walks out the door. \n[133]Yeah? \n[134]What do you mean? 78. \n[135]Oh My God. \n[136]That's called Karma. \n[137]I was looking for Cuddles. A man... pulled me into an alley. He tried... Sara holds her. She can't finish. \n[138]I got away. \n[139]No. \n[140]I don't want to. I can't. Sara pulls out her cell phone. \n[141]Please. I didn't see him. She's so frazzled, she's undoing Sara's nursing efforts. \n[142]It's what you wanted, right? Sara nods, reassuring herself. \n[143]It's my parents house. It was never a home. \n[144]Nothing. \n[145]Leave it alone. Sara is stunned. But Rebecca's parents cease. Her mom gives her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely raising her arms. \n[146]Sara's my roommate. \n[147]Come on, let me show you my room. \n[148]They didn't need to know. Rebecca plops down on the bed. Sara looks around. It's a typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling. \n[149]Yeah, some of my high school work. I haven't gotten around to takin them down. \n[150]Dad! \n[151]She'll stay in my room. Sara turns to Rebecca, confused but willing to go along. \n[152]We can share the bed if you want. Sara looks down at her own \"bed\" and takes a glance at the walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the drawings of Rebecca looking at her. \n[153]Thanks for coming. \n[154]Done. Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair. 86. Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt something. She closes them again. \n[155]Fine. My grades are good. \n[156]I'm making friends. Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat. \n[157]I know. He doesn't know what else to say. Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall. Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture. \n[158]Ready? Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words. Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully. \n[159]Is everything okay? \n[160]Come on. \n[161]I used to come here like every day after school. The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting. One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks. Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches. The chatting girls all fall silent. \n[162]They went to my high school. \n[163]Let's leave. Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table. The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights. 90. \n[164]Hello, Maria. \n[165]Oh, I wanted to introduce you to Sara. My roommate. Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost as if she feels sorry for her. \n[166]Good run? \n[167]I'm going to the art studio. \n[168]Don't wait up, Sara... I feel inspired. She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at the closed door. As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in. \n[169]Forgot my pad. She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it. \n[170]Thanks. So are you. Great lips. What kind is it? \n[171]Can I try it? Irene hands her the lip gloss... Rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips. \n[172]You're right... cinnamon. Irene smiles. This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's. \n[173]Why don't we get out of here. I'd invite you to my place, but I have a roommate. \n[174]What are we waiting for? \n[175]Hey! \n[176]Oh, I got inspired. I just lost track of time. Sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper, grabbing a towel. She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her tattoo. Sara grabs a robe. A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the \"big talk.\" She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca. \n[177]I want a tattoo. Will you come with me? \n[178]Please. It would mean a lot to me. I won't be able to do it without you. Sara looks into her plaintive eyes. So much want in them. \n[179]I know what I want. \n[180]Think of me as your sister. Rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in Sara. \n[181]If you want... you can call me Emily. Sara clenches her fists. She's shaking with rage. She moves toward Rebecca, whose grin fades. \n[182]What's the matter? Sara steps up to her, inches away, ready to beat the shit out of her. And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone. Her eyes search Sara's for an answer. Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door. Rebecca watches her leave through the front window. Sara never looks back. \n[183]What did I do? He stops searching. Looks at her. \n[184]With you? He doesn't answer. He keeps searching... but he can feel Rebecca's eyes on him now. Creepy. He gives up. \n[185]Shhhh. She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts kissing the back of his neck. \n[186]Mm-hmmm. Kissing his back now, moving lower. \n[187]Turn over. 107. Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees... The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable \"Emily\" tattoo. \n[188]Close your eyes. He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move. And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against the skin of her back. Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut. \n[189]But she doesn't love you. Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those aren't Sara's eyes boring into his. Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the knife deep into his gut. He gasps. \n[190]You hurt her. She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open. \n[191]Some role model she turned out to be. Couldn't even take care of herself. Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara drops her phone on the floor. \n[192]Sit down and shut up. Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene. Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone. \n[193]Listen to me. All I ever wanted was to be your friend. A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right. \n[194]No. Shut up. We're not friends. We're here because you betrayed me. \n[195]Stop it. Stop saying things you don't mean. I protected you. From that whore Tracy and that nasty little kitten... and That scumbag of a professor... Even that loser ex-boyfriend of yours. \n[196]I got rid of them all. And how do you repay me? By leaving me. Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment. She looks at Irene. Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in the eye. She puts everything she has into this. \n[197]Now we can start all over again. Let's make things the way they were, Sara. That first day. Just the two of us. Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands. \n[198]After all... you can only have one best friend. \n[199]Lay still bitch. \n[200]Stop! I mean it. Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming. Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor. She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair from Sara's face. \n[201]Shh... I'm so sorry. Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It skitters across the floor and out the door into the living room. Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a chokehold. Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again. Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip. She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara rises... Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of her. As Sara gasps for breath... Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun. Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it. Rebecca turns around and goes for the door. 112. Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's head. IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But... Rebecca bangs the door. \n[202]Don't do this Sara! \n[203]Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I just want to be your friend. \n[204]I know you're scared, Sara. But I promise, everything is gonna be okay. She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge. Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in Irene's eyes. \n[205]Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend, not yours. She raises the gun at the helpless Irene... But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet... \n[206]You won't do it. We're fr-- Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock. Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in frustration. She drops the gun. Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch... Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her knuckles white, and... CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall. She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where... Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of Rebecca's purse everywhere. Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt Sara. \n[207]Friends help each other. They take care of each other. Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca. 116. ", "STEPHEN": "\n[1]Damn! Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd. Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up. \n[2]Oh. Woops. \n[3]Looks like my plan backfired. Sara turns back towards him. \n[4]To spill beer on you so I can start a conversation. \n[5]You pissed? She looks at him. Pretty good looking. Goofy smile. It's hard to be mad at him. She then grabs a beer out of a dancing partier's hand and dumps it on Stephen. \n[6]Come on. \n[7]Exactly. He takes a drink of his beer as Sara takes a long chug of hers. \n[8]Stephen. By the way. \n[9]Twenty-one. \n[10]Tell me about it. My back is killing me. They don't move for a moment, Sara's resting her back against his chest. \n[11]Besides, frat brothers don't have to wear those ugly wristbands. \n[12]Do you want to look for your friend? Sara looks at him sweetly. Nods. \n[13]Guess that would be me. But then he stumbles, nearly dropping them both. \n[14]Apparently God. Sara rolls her eyes. \n[15]You know, I'm going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party. It's like opposite everything we stand for. Sara leans in and gives him a long kiss. Then separates, but her lips still very close to his. \n[16]Honestly, no. She laughs out loud. \n[17]More than I can tell you, but that wouldn't be fair. Sara starts to take off Stephen's jacket. He stops her. \n[18]Keep it... till next time. \n[19]This seems like a pattern. Sara smiles. She's psyched to see him, in spite of the havoc. She leans in and speaks quietly. \n[20]So what does it mean? 37. She coyly shrugs. \n[21]Hey, the gentlemen of Psi Upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight. Sara stares at him blankly. He smiles. \n[22]We're having another keg party. \n[23]You know what? How about if I use you as my excuse not to go. Sara smiles, bits of smoothie dripping from her apron. \n[24]I haven't seen you around too much since you blew me off for dinner. \n[25]Hellllo. I'm studying. She takes his book. He's on page two. \n[26]Yeah, but it's really dense. Off Sara's smile. \n[27]Okay. Let's go. \n[28]I'm going to flunk my test tomorrow, thanks to you. \n[29]Duh, joke's on you. I was going to flunk anyway. She smiles. 49. \n[30]Thanks for helping me... not study. \n[31]You got a curfew? \n[32]That's a little sad. \n[33]Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you know what I mean. She looks at him quizzically. \n[34]Shit, wrong aisle. He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's... EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance. 53. \n[35]Should we head back home? They walk by a small playground comprised of the slide, jungle gym, etc. \n[36]Hmmm... \n[37]What's the bet? She eyes the jungle gym. \n[38]This is kind of a stupid bet. \n[39]Apparently, I'm kind of a stupid guy. \n[40]So. She seductively walks back towards him. Takes his hand. \n[41]Just give me thirty seconds. \n[42]Almost there. \n[43]Yeah, right. He's not quite buying it... but he's cleaning faster. \n[44]You know I don't believe you. Wait, goddamnit, that's supposed to be my strip tease. \n[45]I'm just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again. \n[46]I knew you didn't have the guts. She flicks her bra at his face. He catches it, shocked. He tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams shut behind them. \n[47]Sara... \n[48]Anything wrong? Sara is taken out of her own world \n[49]Are you ok? \n[50]I've made a decision. You ready? \n[51]I'm gonna quit the band. \n[52]It's a waste of time-and we suck. \n[53]Well, let me think about this. The only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriend's coffee shop. 79. \n[54]You heard me. \n[55]Dinner at the frat, the football games. Don't forget the always awkward, homoerotic humor. \n[56]Oh. For sure. \n[57]I get it. I'm going to make out with my pillow and pretend it's you. \n[58]I'll miss you. Rebecca pulls up in her car. Sara gets in. Rebecca gives Stephen an \"I win\" look as Sara closes the door. 82. \n[59]Your door was open. \n[60]Sorry. Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her tight and speaks, muffled by her neck. 93. \n[61]What are those? A beat. Should she bring him into this? \n[62]Jesus. I thought she was just weird. \n[63]Certainly doesn't seem like she's been taking them. He's right and she knows it. A beat. 94. \n[64]This is all you're taking? \n[65]Where's your necklace? She instinctively rubs the base of her neck. \n[66]Sara... \n[67]Wait here. I'll go look for it. She kisses him tenderly, unbelievably appreciative. \n[68]Have you seen Sara's necklace? Rebecca solemnly shakes her head. He looks around the dresser. In the drawers. Flips over Sara's pillow. Rebecca watches him. \n[69]She just needs to move on. \n[70]If you do find it, can you let me know? Instead of answering, Rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture. Stephen stares at her, unnerved. He finally snaps out of it and walks out the door. She watches him go. \n[71]You should call someone. The dean's office. Or at least your R.A. She keeps cleaning. \n[72]Well, she sure scared the shit out of me. Sara really wants to change the subject. She holds up two of his t-shirts. \n[73]Somewhere in between. She throws the t-shirts at him. \n[74]I can walk you there. \n[75]Party starts at ten. Really cool band... \n[76]He may be, but I'm sleeping with his girlfriend... She kisses him. \n[77]Sure, I have to go look for my girlfriend anyway. She walks away. \"Jerk\". He grins... and now checks his watch. Where's Sara? \n[78]Okay I've got you. Everything is gonna be okay! He pulls her halfway in the window... But a shadow rises behind him. \n[79]Sara. She races over to him. He's barely alive. \n[80]Welcome back. \n[81]Better now. You being here's gonna help. Sara smiles. \n[82]How's moving in going? \n[83]Well let me give you some time to get settled in. \n[84]Okay. \n[85]This isn't exactly what I had in mind. Sara grins. \n[86]I'll be back to pick you up for dinner. You gonna be ready? ", "TRACY": "\n[1]Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go. \n[2]They're a frat. Beer... guys... \n[3]For a frat party?! Seriously? He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim steps around him. \n[4]Come on, just us. We won't tell. The bouncer is tempted but not budging. \n[5]Wuss. Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara. \n[6]You want something to drink? \n[7]Why aren't you dancing? \n[8]They're not that bad. Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as Tracy chugs her drink. \n[9]Hey Sara. Sara sees Tracy sitting by the window with Kim. Sara walks over, but Rebecca doesn't follow. \n[10]RRRRRREBECCA. How formal. What can we call you? \n[11]How 'bout Becky? \n[12]\n[13]Cancel those library plans. Guess who made the guest list at Rebar? You guys in? I trust you have fake IDs? \n[14]Yes you do. Thanks to my badass self. 25. Tracy pulls out a fake ID. She walks to Rebecca and holds it out to her. A peace offering. Rebecca stares at Tracy for a beat... then goes back to her sketchbook. \n[15]How great is this? No parents. No curfews. \n[16]Too bad Rebecca blew us off. Talk about the life of the party. \n[17]I'm just saying. \n[18]Yeah right... 26. As Tracy rolls her eyes... The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods down the bar at... TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not so sure about this. \n[19]I think... Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink. Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys. \n[20]We can do better. She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor. \n[21]Hey. Sara thinks about ignoring her but stops. Her tone is cold. \n[22]Psi U. tonight? \n[23]Sara... the guy had a Porsche. And a hot tub. \n[24]What I meant to say is -- I'm sorry -- I totally screwed up. Down the hall, we see Rebecca open her door and peek out. She watches Tracy and Sara. Tracy gives Sara sad, puppy dog eyes. Sara laughs. \n[25]Water. I need water. She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door... And lets out a sharp little scream. \n[26]Rebecca? What are you doing? Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her. Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes. She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and smiles. She disappears into her room. Tracy stands there, spooked. \n[27]Listen... something is up with your roommate. \n[28]She was outside my room this morning. \n[29]Waiting for me. I opened my door... and there she was. Just sitting there, staring. Like some psycho. \n[30]You don't believe me? \n[31]Why don't you ask her? I've gotta go...I'll see ya later. Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building. Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway. Tracy leaves in a hurry. \n[32]Hey. Tracy, wearing just a towel, and brushing her teeth as she walks, steps into the bathroom. \n[33]You have to be kidding me. Hey! The only light is some distorted moonlight through the window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel. Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall... The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her towel... and steps back under the steaming water. A beat. The lights go off again. \n[34]Goddammit ! She turns off the shower. A beat of silence, but now... one of the other showers turns on. What the hell? \n[35]Hey, how about turning on the light? 47. No response. Yet another shower turns on. \n[36]Who's out there? Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along the wall again. She turns on the lights. The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers. Tracy stares at them. A beat. \n[37]I know it's you. She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns it off. She stares at the other curtain. \n[38]Sara thinks you're weird. She told me. She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off that shower, too. But she can still hear running water. She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed again. The sound of running water behind it. She walks over. \n[39]Not funny, Rebecca.  Bitch. She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the curtain open to see... Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around -- no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower. \n[40]Freak. Just as the warm water starts to relax her... THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca. The curtain comes right off the rings. Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both. 48. Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down. Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca. \n[41]Oh, hey. Tracy smiles, but weakly. The girl's lost all her sparkle. Her eyes dart around nervously, like a bird's. \n[42]Yeah, Conrad Hall. Seemed like a better vibe. \n[43]I'll call you. But she's already walking away. ", "PROFESSOR ROBERTS": "\n[1]So... here we are. Design 101. And each one of you is asking yourself the same question...  Who is this guy? Why should I turn off my Blackberry and pay attention to him? Mild laughter from the class. \n[2]I'll tell you why -- because I hold the keys to the kingdom. Think of your favorite designers. Marc Jacobs. Vera Wang. Rick Owens. Magicians, right? I've got news for you: All of their magic stems from the same source: the fundamental principles of design. I can teach you those principles. He lets the power of his words sink in. \n[3]The journey to the catwalks of New York... Paris... Tokyo... starts right here, in this room. And all you have to do is open your minds. Man, she wants in. \n[4]I'm afraid we're full. But don't worry -- Intro Design has three other sections. \n[5]What's your name? \n[6]Tell me, Sara -- why should I sign your request form when I've turned down a dozen others? Would that be fair? Sara's face falls. A long beat. 23. \n[7]But... Who said life was fair? You happen to have two things I can't teach... He walks to her... and hands her the signed form. \n[8]Style. And Desire. He smiles, signs the form and hands it to Sara. Sara clutches the form to her chest, smiling. \n[9]Contrary to popular opinion, beauty is not in the eye of the beholder. It's in the hands of the designer. Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes with a text message. She discreetly takes a look. \n[10]Who can tell me the difference between fashion and style? FROM IRENE: \"4th &amp; ford. be there now.\" Sara smiles at the message. Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her. \n[11]Miss Matthews? Without missing a beat, Sara replies. \n[12]Exactly. All the money in the world can't buy you style. \n[13]Your midterm designs are due Friday. Remember, class: Simplicity. Who founded our industry? Eve -- when she handed Adam that fig leaf. Students laugh on their way out the door. As Sara walks past Roberts... \n[14]Sara. Could I see you in my office, please? \n[15]I don't think I need to tell you how impressed I've been with your work. Every year I go to Fashion Week in Paris. It's dazzling. The photo shoots... the parties... that incredible runway. When the first model bursts through the curtain and hits that catwalk? Sara, a roar goes up from that crowd that's like... nothing you've ever heard. The college allows me to take one student. All expenses paid. 70. \n[16]Full backstage access. Usually, it's a senior. But it doesn't have to be. Sara's pulse is racing. \n[17]I'm saying you have a shot. You'd have to earn it, Sara. \n[18]I'd like to see more danger in your work. Your designs are always crisp; they're always clear. But they're a little... safe. That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face. Roberts walks over to her. \n[19]Don't be afraid to go to some of the... He delicately taps her temple. \n[20]darker places in here. \n[21]The best designers push the boundaries of what's... acceptable. They take chances. Do you like to take chances, Sara? \n[22]So do I. He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her chair. She stands in front of him, shaking. \n[23]I took a chance, that's all. With a student that I trust. \n[24]Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't blow the chance of a lifetime. She hurries out of the office. \n[25]That's right. \n[26]Actually, I was just... But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor. \n[27]You're not one of my students. \n[28]And why is that? \n[29]I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not sure what I can do to help. \n[30]Look, I've always made it a policy not to accept any students this late in the term. \n[31]Ex-wife . until he's behind Rebecca. his wedding ring. He palms it. \n[32]A few things I'd need to know. \n[33]Do you have any design experience? \n[34]What do you know about clothes? \n[35]And what's that? \n[36]I think we might be able to work something out. \n[37]Kiss me. I'll take it from there. 75. He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second, and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had a taste -- he wants a lot more. Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens. \n[38]You bitch tease! \n[39]What? How did?... Who are you? He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells again. \n[40]Please don't do this. Twenty years. Everything I worked for. I'll pay for that tape. ", "IRENE": "\n[1]Finally. She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress. \n[2]Hell, I wanna be me when I grow up. \n[3]You know, your dad left me four messages last week. Making sure I'm looking out for his baby. \n[4]I told him I haven't seen you. And that for all I know you're a crack ho by now. Even the model laughs. \n[5]What took you so long? \n[6]You didn't! \n[7]Sara! You can't just walk around downtown L.A. at night. This is not Des Moines. \n[8]Seriously, listen to me. That's why I own a gun. Sara's shocked. \n[9]Absolutely! Big cities are crawling with crazies. Sara moves into the apartment. Her phone rings. She answers. \n[10]Yeah, why? \n[11]Can't. Travel too much. Poor thing would starve to death. 61. \n[12]Who was that? \n[13]That's no fun. \n[14]What? \n[15]Oh yeah. I went through my closet. There's nothing here I've worn in the past six months. Irene walks toward the couch where there's a pile of clothes. \n[16]What ...what? \n[17]Oh my God, I just had the best idea. \n[18]Why don't you move in here with me? 62. \n[19]Yeah, I'm never here. The place is huge. Ditch the roommate. And, the building allows pets. \n[20]Great. So, how's Jason? I really liked him. \n[21]Yeah ...he sucked. \n[22]I'm sorry to stare, but you are so beautiful. \n[23]It's cinnamon. Caffeinated. A girl never knows how late she's gonna party. Rebecca smiles. A beat. 95. \n[24]As luck would have it, I'm only two blocks away and...no roommate. \n[25]Shit. She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table. \n[26]My phone. My phone. She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table. She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut! \n[27]The window! There's a fire escape. You can reach it. \n[28]Hurry!! He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her. \n[29]", "JASON": "\n[1]I just wanted to hear your voice. \n[2]I need to talk to you. \n[3]Sara, listen I... I want to come out there. \n[4]Sara? \n[5]Sara, you answered. Thank you. Can we talk... about us? Rebecca's eyes clear. She's in control again. She sits down on Sara's bed, tossing Cuddles roughly to the floor. And now \n[6]You do? \n[7]I.. . want you, too. But... \n[8]Like you wouldn't believe. \n[9]Sara... Sara... Sara... Rebecca writhes, eyes closed. \n[10]Sara... Sara... They moan together. Louder and louder... and now they finish. A long beat. 58. \n[11]Jesus, Sara. That was incredible. Rebecca smiles. \n[12]I miss you so much. Her smile dies. She picks up the phone. A cruel gleam in her eyes. \n[13]Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210. Call me, okay? He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the door before it closes. \n[14]Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash. \n[15]\n[16]Sara? You got my voicemail. \n[17]Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good. She works her way back up to his ear. \n[18]I love you, Sara. She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife. ", "JEFF": "\n[1]Yeah, we think Rebecca is so talented. Rebecca shakes her head, uncomfortable with the flattery. \n[2]\n[3]What? As a parent you worry. You protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and she's on her own. I'm just relieved she got a good roommate. Sara cuts discreet looks around the table. Who are these people? \n[4]Becs. You scared me. Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty look. We know how much she hates nicknames. \n[5]How're you doing? \n[6]That's not what I meant. She looks down at the table. 87. \n[7]Rebecca, look at me for a second. Now she looks at him. \n[8]Your mother and I are very fond of you. \n[9]I just wanted to make sure. Good night, I'm heading back to bed. He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs. ", "KIM": "\n[1]I don't drink anyway. Tracy looks at her, mouth agape. 5. \n[2]She was getting more punch. Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively, egging on the crowd. \n[3]Did you try the punch? It's pretty good. \n[4]I'm the worst roommate ever. Kim goes back to dancing Sara looks a little worried which Stephen notices. \n[5]Thanks Sara. \n[6]You want us to wait? Sara turns and glares at Kim. An obvious \"NO!\" Kim lets the doors close as Sara turns back to Stephen. 11. \n[7]How 'bout Reba? Tracy sticks her finger down her throat. Gag me. \n[8]How's it goin? ", "GIRL": "\n[1]Sorry! Bad driver. Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair -- clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl smiles sheepishly. \n[2]In case of emergency. I'm Tracy. \n[3]Hi. disorienting Sara. \n[4]Rebecca. Your roommate. Sara calms, catching on. \n[5]So what do we do? Sara looks her over. Checks out her outfit. \n[6]Yeah. Sara snatches the book. \n[7]Help me find the keg? ", "ALISON": "\n[1]Sara, I'll make up a room for you -- \n[2]Hi Sara. \n[3]Wonderful. Alison peers up the stairs. \n[4]Rebecca seems to be doing well. \n[5]Is she taking her medication? \n[6]Hey sweetheart. She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed. \n[7]Have a great time, you two. "}}
