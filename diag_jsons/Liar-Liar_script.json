{"dialogues": {"FLETCHER": "\n[1]A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. \n[2]Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. \n[3]Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. \n[4]You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife? \n[5]And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. \n[6]As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help. First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a sigh of relief: \"Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!\" But do the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer! \n[7]\u00b7 And why? Why does the State \n[8]Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on you! \n[9]Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower! \n[10]Another gratifying day serving Justice. \n[11]Stay out of my neighborhood after dark. \n[12]No, I'm late picking up my son. \n[13]Maximillian! \n[14]Malfunction in vector 3 ! ! Malfunction in vector 3!! Look out! It's on tickle mode!! \n[15]And who is this lovely lady? Max, could you introduce me? \n[16]You know, you were much easier when we were married... So where are you off too? \n[17]O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on a bike. \n[18]\n[19]What? No kiss for me? \n[20]I didn't know the boyfriend was going. \n[21]T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean you two are... \n[22]MEDIC!! I've been hit. \n[23]Well, great... I'm so happy for you two. I am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy. \n[24]Aud, I am so sorry... \n[25]Yo u gonna be okay? Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all? \n[26]Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max. \n[27]Absolutely, Maxattacker. We just have to stop by the office for one minute. \n[28]\n[29]Philip! \n[30]. Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was \n[31]Oh, me too. I can never get enough of charades. We'll have to do it again sometime. \n[32]Soon. \n[33]Not that soon. I'm taking Max to see wrestling-- \n[34]I don't think so. See, Max is really shy around strangers. \n[35]Tell you what -- give me your card as a reminder. I'll call y o u . Soon. Promise. \n[36]Fabulous! I love it. \n[37]Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday? \n[38]Oh, I'm... fixing the card, Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple. \n[39]Hey, Pete! Great tie!        \u00b7. \n[40]Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. \n[41]\n[42]Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second. \n[43]Damn!   I completely forgot. \n[44]You're a saint. I should get you something. \n[45]Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls? \n[46]Tell him it's in the mail. \n[47]Write him a long, explanatory letter. Then bill him for the letter. \n[48]I ' m on vacation. \n[49]It's a long vacation. \n[50]As if I don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. Tell her I'm in court. \n[51]Tell her I broke my leg and had to be shot. \n[52]--And then send out a notice of judgement on my win today! \n[53]Miranda! I didn't see you. Hey, you look lovely, today. Here, I bought you a gift. \n[54]\n[55]Of course we are. A promise i s a promise. We are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't Fletcher T. Reid. \n[56]Could you hand me that? \n[57]Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty? \n[58]Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... \n[59]. . . A present! . \n[60]It's... it's. a surprise. \n[61]Baseball stuff. \n[62]Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. \n[63]Big fun. Manly fun. Am I right, Maxie? \n[64]So how were the wrestling matches ? Did you have fun? \n[65]Did you see that? He struck the child! \n[66]Tonight? \n[67]The seventeenth of May is the day I .remind myself that the eighteenth is Max's birthday. See you tonight. \n[68]Thank you. \n[69]Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his? \n[70]After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of \n[71]Hm? \n[72]--Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for. \n[73]Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- \n[74]\n[75]And you've always been a good wife. \n[76]There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. Will you give me that opportunity?  He stares into her eyes. A moment, then... \n[77]Good for you! \n[78]Oh, pshaw. \n[79]Excuse me? \n[80]Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa--                . \n[81]Nothing. I just nailed my \u00b7knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it. \n[82]I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay? \n[83]Ah, no.     I have to go. \n[84]I've had better. \n[85]\"I've had better?\" \n[86]\"I've had better?!\" \n[87]\"I've had better?\" \n[88]New in the building? \n[89]Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour. \n[90]No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. \n[91]Unquestionably. \n[92]No. \n[93]Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or \n[94]I've had better. \n[95]Dana.         \" \n[96]Fifty per cent of your estate. \n[97]Our case is simply this. . . \n[98]I'm trying! \n[99]Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- \n[100]Yes, Your Honor. \n[101]Yes, Your Honor. \n[102]Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. \n[103]I have lower standards, Your Honor. \n[104]What are you doing? \n[105]. \n[106]I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance. \n[107]I can't lie! \n[108]\n[109]It certainly does. \n[110]Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. \n[111]No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When \n[112]The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor.       \u00b7 \n[113]We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. \n[114]\"Confident\" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. \n[115]Bastard! \n[116]No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead, \n[117]Seven!     \u00b7 \n[118]Mrs. Cole, you don't        \u00b7. understand, I-- \n[119]Your cellulite, Tubster. \n[120]'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it. \n[121]\n[122]Red.   Red. All right. Focus, \n[123]. The pen is blue!! The pen is     . \n[124]Oh, that's easy for you to say?! \n[125]I have to go home. \n[126]No. I have to be in court at one-thirty. \n[127]I don't know, I don't know!!! \n[128]I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . \n[129]I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar.. \n[130]\n[131]\n[132]Tell her I'm a thoughtless son who'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her-- but only if she asks. You.might also add that she deserves better, though I hope to God you don't. \n[133]\n[134]\n[135]I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me. \n[136]It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. \n[137]How about that. I really do. \n[138]Yes, but-this time it's different. \n[139]\n[140]No. \n[141]Having sex. \n[142]No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that seemed more important than attending my son's birthday! \n[143]\n[144]Answer, answer, answer... \n[145]Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me-- \n[146]What?! \n[147]Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him. \n[148]Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone? \n[149]Where are you? \n[150]When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk. \n[151]I'll be right- there! \n[152]Aaaah! \n[153]Uh -- not really, no. \n[154]None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would. \n[155]I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests. \n[156]Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. \n[157]The color of the pen is -- re d !      . \n[158]I ' m an inconsiderate prick! \n[159]C'mon, you can do this! The color of the pen is -- RED! \n[160]Depends on how long you were following me. \n[161]Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a \n[162]No. \n[163]It's in my other pants. \n[164]Hanging from my boss's credenza. \n[165]No. \n[166]Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't! \n[167]I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. Unpaid parking tickets. Be gentle. \n[168]Audrey, wait! \n[169]I can explain-- \n[170]Yes. \n[171]Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me. \n[172]Ow. \n[173]You scratched my car! \n[174]Right there! \n[175]Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this? \n[176]\n[177]Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation. \n[178]You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair. \n[179]Last night-- \n[180]All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. \n[181]No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too. \n[182]This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time? \n[183]Ten-to-six. \n[184]Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it! \n[185]Hi. Listen, I need to talk to \n[186]Yes. \n[187]Well, actually-- \u00b7 \n[188]Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. \n[189]Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer. \n[190]It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me. \n[191]I help people fight over their money and their children. \n[192]To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. \n[193]Monster-Max. \n[194]No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. \n[195]I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen? \n[196]That's why he should have worn make-up. \n[197]Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. \n[198]Yes. \n[199]No matter what. \n[200]In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no. \n[201]Not in a million years. \n[202]Uh-uh. \n[203]Only if you can't 'swim. \n[204]Because your mom buys it. \n[205]I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together. \n[206]. Yes! This is absolutely an \n[207]Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back. \n[208]Not to you. \n[209]Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me \"How do I lo ok?\" So I'd say, \"Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? \n[210]Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? \n[211]Will you help me anyway? \n[212]That's my boy! \n[213]Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. \n[214]Great! Great! Now to test -- \n[215]Only what? \n[216]Well, then do it again.        Only this time, mean it. \n[217]Why not?! \n[218]I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies-- \n[219]I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? \n[220]I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. \n[221]Short and shrivelled. \n[222]No -- \n[223]No -- \n[224]No -- \n[225]Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! \n[226]No. \n[227]My son hates me. \n[228]O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a \u00b7wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day. \n[229]It came true. \n[230]It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning? \n[231]That's right!     I am incapable of lying. \n[232]Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse. \n[233]You don't believe me. \n[234]Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. \n[235]Forget it. Let's not do this. \n[236]Greta, please... Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? \n[237]In a way. \n[238]Jumbo's House of Junk. \n[239]I'll give you the raise! \n[240]Hi, Judge Stevens?... Yes, I know I haven't given you a reason. \n[241]But if you could just do this for me, I-- \n[242]Hold on, please, \n[243]Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the Judge! Greta... \n[244]I'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. Don't leave. \n[245]Yes? \n[246]No. . . but what' s your poijit! \n[247]\n[248]Aaaah! \n[249]Extremely. \n[250]He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. \n[251]Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye. \n[252]little too \n[253]Fu-- fu-- \n[254]\n[255]Well, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. \n[256]Your Honor, I object! \n[257]\n[258]No questions. \n[259]\n[260]How?! \n[261]Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break? \n[262]Not unless you want to mop up. \n[263]What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! \n[264]I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! \n[265]A madman, Your Honor.. A desperate fool at the end of his pitiful.rope. \n[266]\n[267]Yes, I can. \n[268]Hello. \n[269]\n[270]The twins. \n[271]Sure. \n[272]\n[273]I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? \n[274]Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions-- \n[275]Exactly. \n[276]Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... \"Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--\" \n[277]Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! \n[278]C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question! \n[279]Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. \n[280]Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole? \n[281]Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? \n[282]If I might rephrase your Honor. Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not? \n[283]Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? \n[284]How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking?              ' \n[285]Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- \n[286]\n[287]No further questions. \n[288]I have no further witnesses, your Honor. \n[289]What are you doing? Call me. \n[290]I can't. \n[291]You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! \n[292]Thirty-one? \n[293]\n[294]Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia? \n[295]But that would be a lie, wouldn't it? \n[296]Isn't your true name... \n[297]Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then? \n[298]And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you? C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will. \n[299]So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself? \n[300]\n[301]Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR \n[302]\n[303]What? \n[304]He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? . \n[305]But -- but -- you said he was a good father. \n[306]No.                                            . \n[307]Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? \n[308]T his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too? \n[309]\n[310]-Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away. I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners! \n[311]\n[312]Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS \n[313]\n[314]\n[315]Audrey!   It's Fletcher-- \n[316]Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good... Pack?! Did you say pack?! \n[317]A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello? O ne more call!! I need another call!! \n[318]And what about our water su pply ? You don't think \"the man's\" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ \"The man\" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. \n[319]That's me. Fletcher T. Reid. Pawn no. 332-154-9867. \n[320]Audrey? Greta?! \n[321]Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at you, you well preserved, underpaid, overworked, underappreciated thing you. G iv e me a hug! You came and got me out!! Hug me!! \n[322]Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here.., \n[323]Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth. \n[324]Answeransweransweranswer... \n[325]Shelton, Jerry Shelton. What time's that flight leave? 7:50. Thank you. \n[326]Shiiiiit!!! \n[327]Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... \n[328]W h y ? What for?

I'm not gonna lose my son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer. Now if you want to follow me, car after I get where I'm going. I'm a lawyer and I k now my rights!

You let me use the phone or I start talking!! \n[341]\n[342]You're saving my life, Philip. \n[343]I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face. I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? \n[344]Then why are you always trying to socialize with me? \n[345]Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant.
