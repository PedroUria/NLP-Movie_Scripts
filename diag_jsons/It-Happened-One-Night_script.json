{"dialogues": {"PETER": "\n[1]Listen, monkey-face\u0097when you fired me, you fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had. And the scene cuts to a New York NEWSPAPER OFFICE where the night editor, Gordon, his sleeves rolled up, sits at his desk shrieking into the phone. \n[2]That was free verse, you gashouse palooka! \n[3]That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that\u0097 \n[4]Oh, so you're changing your tune, eh? Well, it's about time. But it's going to do you no good, my tough friend. It's a little too late for apologies. I wouldn't go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees! I hope this is a lesson to you! He snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged pride, following which the view expands to include his public. \n[5]Give me any of his lip, will he? Huh! I guess he knows now what I think of his job!  Is my chariot ready? ? 220 ? \n[6]That's right, my friends. Cling to your jobs! Remain slaves the rest of your lives! Scum of the earth! Newspaper men! Not me! When I'm basking in the glorious arms of the Muse\u0097what'll you be doing? Chasing news. You miserable worms. For what? A mere pittance! My heart goes out to you.  Good-bye. (and with this he turns his back and enters the bus \n[7]Scram. The scene cuts to the INTERIOR of the BUS as viewed from the front, the view moving forward, passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats. Every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable, which adds to their uninviting appearance. Mothers cling to crying babies. A Swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey. A surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes. The moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers. Standing before the seat is Peter, his suitcase in his hand, speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers. \n[8]Hey, driver! How about clearing this stuff away! Several passengers (seen from his position in the back) crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder. Through a glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute instructions from a superintendent, who stands on the running board, their voices in- ? 221 ? distinguishable. In answer to Peter's request, the driver glances back indifferently, and continues talking to the superintendent. A close view of PETER shows him arching his eyebrows, an amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver. He drops his suitcase and starts forward. Then we see him arriving at the glass partition, and Peter taps playfully on the pane with his finger-nails, whereupon the driver turns and pulls the window down a few inches. \n[9]If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat. \n[10]Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off. He wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat. En route he bestows genial smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers, and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is breastfeeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles from her lips. \n[11]Personally, I was raised on a bottle.  When I was a baby, I insisted on it. You know why?  I never liked the idea of getting cigarette ashes in my eyes. He moves forward, leaving the woman unable to make head or tail of it; and assuming that he's crazy, she shrugs her shoulders and turns her attention to the baby. Now PETER arrives at his seat, and whistling softly, raises the window. Unhurriedly, he picks the newspaper bundles up one by one and flings them out of the window. They hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud. Thereupon a close view of the DRIVER shows him reacting violently to Peter's unprecedented cheek, and starting down from his seat. PETER has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles and still whistling his favorite melody, he picks up his suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead. At this point, the driver enters the side door of the bus. \n[12]Huh? \n[13]Oh\u0097the papers\u0097 He slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the floor. \n[14]That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants. \n[15]Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants. \n[16]It's okay with me. I'm not arguing. \n[17]Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss. During his speech, Ellie enters from the rear and plunks herself into Peter's seat. Unseen by Peter, she places her small bag beside her. ? 223 ? \n[18]Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago. \n[19]You win! Smiling, he turns to sit down. But the smile dies on his face when he finds his place occupied by Ellie, who stares out the window. \n[20]Excuse me, lady\u0097 \u0097 but that upon which you sit\u0097is mine. Ellie glances up at him\u0097then down at her buttocks. \n[21]Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you\u0097  scram. \n[22]Driver! \n[23]These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they? \n[24]Move over, lady. This is a \"maybe they do.\" He plops into the seat, the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief. Ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him. But Peter suddenly looks down toward the floor, following which a close-up AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag on the floor annoys Peter. With his foot he slowly moves it over to her, and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again. Next we see Ellie glaring at him, picking up her bag, and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead. But just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her, and she falls backward right in Peter's lap. Their noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, and they glare at each other hostilely. Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat, turning her back on him. \n[25]Next time you drop in, bring your folks. This dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD, and the bus sways perilously as it speeds through the night, following which the view dissolves to the INTERIOR of the BUS, revealing Peter slumped in his seat, his hat drawn over his eyes. Ellie has her head thrown back, trying to sleep. But the swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side uncomfortably, and finally she gives up. \n[26]Are you talking to me? \n[27]Okay. And much to her surprise, he sighs deeply and relaxes to his former position, shutting his eyes. She glares at him crushingly. The scene dissolves to another view of the BUS, disclosing the driver, and suddenly the bus comes to a stop. ? 225 ? \n[28]He got away. I suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk. ELLIE  doesn't know what he's talking about. She looks at him, puzzled. \n[29]Well\u0097of all the\u0097well\u0097  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone. At this, Ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where her bag had been. \n[30]Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually. \n[31]That cadaverous-looking yegg[2] who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run! \n[32]Don't tell me your ticket was in it? \n[33]You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville. \n[34]I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean. \n[35]Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? \n[36]Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that\u0097 \n[37]Why, you ungrateful brat! The scene dissolves to the BUS, where all the passengers are scattering back to their seats; Peter is already seated, when Ellie arrives. A close view then shows her standing uncertainly for a moment, speculating whether to cross over his legs to get her place by the window. Peter feels her presence by his side and glances up. She tosses her head and plants herself in the seat in front of him, vacated by the young man who stole her bag. Peter takes the affront with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near the window. The scene dissolves to a close view of Ellie and a recently arrived fat man next to her. She has her head thrown back in an effort to sleep, but the fat man, his hands clasped over his protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies him. Suddenly the bus careens, the fat man falls against Ellie, and she awakens with a start and pushes him back. The fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few seconds the procedure is repeated, and Ellie is beside herself. She looks around for somewhere to flee. PETER, seated in back of her, in his customary slumped position, opens his eyes slightly. It is apparent he has been watching her for some time, for he grins at her discomfiture. Ellie's head turns in his direction and the grin leaves Peter's face. He shuts his eyes and pretends to be asleep. Ellie glances at Peter to make certain he is asleep. The fat man falls against her again and it is all she can stand. She starts to rise. Peter sees her coming and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him, still pretending to be asleep. Just as Ellie starts to sit, she notices his hand and is embarrassed. Gingerly she picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee. She then slides into the seat, sighing with relief, whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is amused. Slowly his head turns\u0097and he scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly. Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse of Peter\u0097and is startled to find him gazing at her. She turns forward, her jaw set forbiddingly. The scene dissolves to the view of a ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, against the horizon, the bus, a mere speck, makes its lone way over the deserted country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, reading \"JACKSONVILLE,\" and then into the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE and PETER. They are both asleep, her head resting comfortably on his shoulder, Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then the view draws back. The bus is empty except for Ellie and Peter, the last few passengers are just leaving. PETER's eyes slowly open. He looks down at the head on his shoulder and grins. With a sigh, he shuts his eyes again and resumes his slumber. Next, at the front of the bus, the DRIVER stands staring at Peter and Ellie in this intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly. \n[38]Yes. \n[39]I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast? \n[40]Good morning. Peter is in the foreground, the guard is seen in the background. Ellie stares at Peter, perplexed. \n[41]Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night. \n[42]What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? (Ellie glares at him, disdaining to reply\u0097this angers him, and he continues hotly Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian. \n[43]Yeah. I missed it, too. There is a close view of the two. She turns to him. Her interest is provoked by his tone of voice. She glances up into his face. \n[44]You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket. \n[45]I found it on the seat. \n[46]You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.  \n[47]Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team. \n[48]You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. \n[49]Quit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. He pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly. \n[50]Take my advice\u0097grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. \n[51]That's right. You didn't. \n[52]What for? \n[53]I never thought of that. ? 232 ? \n[54]Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word \"Humility\"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, \"Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?\" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me. He turns his back on her and leaves. A close-up of ELLIE shows her staring after him, her eyes blazing angrily. In a TELEGRAPH OFFICE, Peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter, which she reads. \n[55]You send telegrams here? \n[56]Go on. Go on send the telegram. \n[57]Mush. Mush. ? 233 ? \n[58]Send it collect. \n[59]Hey, you! Shapeley's laugh dies down. He looks dumbly up at Peter, his two fingers still held in mid-air. \n[60]There's a seat over there for you. \n[61]I'd like to sit with my\u0097uh\u0097wife\u0097if you don't mind.  \n[62]Yeah. Come on\u0097come on! \n[63]Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves. She feels herself crushed, and ventures no further comment as Peter resumes his interest in his magazine. A full view of the BUS follows, and there is silence for a while as the bus slows down and comes to a stop. Almost simultaneously a boy makes his appearance, selling magazines and candy. ? 237 ? \n[64]What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money? \n[65]Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. (he gestures with his thumb for the boy to leave \n[66]Beat it! (and the boy, frightened by his voice, leaves \n[67]A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going? \n[68]You're on a budget from now on. ? 238 ? (he flings her purse back at her and pockets the money \n[69]Shut up! He returns to his magazine, leaving her staring at him petulantly as the scene fades out. Part Four SOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD at night. This is apparently on the outskirts of a town. Two local policemen and our bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth. The rain sweeps across their faces as they talk. The passengers in the bus, which stands in the background, stick their heads out, trying to hear what is going on. \n[70]What's up? \n[71]Yeah? Where? \n[72]Yeah. \n[73]Thanks. ? 239 ? He dashes toward the bus. Then he appears at the side door of the bus. \n[74]Hey, Brat\u0097!  The view moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step. \n[75]Yeah. Come on\u0097we're stopping here for the night. He disappears inside the bus through the side door. With an independent toss of her head, Ellie turns and also enters the bus, but through the rear door. The scene dissolves to DYKE'S AUTO CAMP. Ellie stands alone on the porch of a small bungalow, sheltered from the rain. Over her head is a sign reading: OFFICE-Dyke Auto Co.\u0097P. D. Dyke, Prop. She looks about her restlessly, giving the impression that she has been waiting for someone. Suddenly she is attracted by something and gazes in its direction. Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, there appears, about twenty yards away, a small cabin, lighted on the inside; and from it Peter emerges accompanied by a man\u0097presumably Mr. Dyke. We cannot hear what is being said; from their movements, however, it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place. Dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward Ellie. At the same time, Peter calls to her: \n[76]Hey! Come on! We're all set.  Ellie hesitates a moment, then starts toward the cabin. Now she is hurrying across the open space. En route she passes Dyke. \n[77]Come on! Come on! What are you going to do? Stand there all night?  For a long moment, ELLIE is lost in speculation as to how to proceed. Then, tossing her head defiantly, with her lips set grimly, she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it, stops in the doorway and peers in. As she does this, there is a view of the inside of the CABIN, as seen by her at the door. Except for two cots on either side of the room, a few sticks of cane furniture, a small table upon which stands an oil burner for cooking, the place is barren. At the moment Peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the room. His suitcase is already open. And now Ellie steps inside, surveying the place contemptuously. But Peter, with his back to her, is oblivious of her presence; and as he works, he hums his favorite melody. Ellie finally breaks the silence. \n[78]Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. (but he finishes his hammering and turns to his suitcase \n[79]Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. (the matter-of-fact way in which he says this causes her eyebrows to lift \n[80]I kind of half expected you to thank me. \n[81]Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's? There is silence for a moment, and Peter proceeds with the unpacking of his suitcase. As she watches him, Ellie's mood changes from one of anger to that of sarcasm. ? 241 ? \n[82]Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you? All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to-day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it. \n[83]This? Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. (he goes back to the business of laying out his things \n[84]Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy? Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right. While he speaks he has taken the extra blanket from the cot and hung it over the clothes line. This manages to divide the room in half. ? 242 ? A close view at the door shows Ellie watching him with interest. \n[85]Oh, this?\u0097I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas. He flings them over to her, and she catches them and throws them on her cot. Throughout the scene she hasn't budged from the door, but Peter now prepares to undress. \n[86]Do you mind joining the Israelites? \n[87]All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.  A close view of ELLIE shows her standing stubbornly. \n[88]Years later his secret came out. He wore a toupee. He lights a cigarette diffidently while she remains brazenly watching him, her eyes flashing defiantly. \n[89]I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first\u0097then the tie\u0097then the shirt\u0097now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different. ? 243 ?  I go for the shoes first. After that \n[90]Still with me, Brat?  Don't be a sucker. A night's rest'll do you a lot of good. Besides, you've got nothing to worry about. The Walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf. A close view shows ELLIE glancing over at the blanket. Despite herself, the suggestion of a smile flits across her face. \n[91]Not even a mouth organ. Pulling the covers back, he prepares to get into bed, humming as he does so. \n[92]Who's afraid of the big bad wolf\u0097 The big bad wolf, the big bad wolf.  She's afraid of the big bad wolf, Tra-la-la-la-la\u0097  Ellie smiles, and wearily she pulls her hat off her head. She sits this way a moment, thoughtfully; then, determined, she looks up. \n[93]Not at all. ? 244 ?  The room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light coming in the window from the night-light outside the camp. Visible are Peter's face and arms as he stares ceilingward, while on Ellie's side all we can see of her is her silhouette, except for such times as she gets in direct line with the window. There are glimpses of her as she moves around in the process of undressing, and we see, or rather sense, her dress dropping to the floor. She now stands in her chemise; this being white silk, it stands out more prominently against the darkness. She picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner, following which a close-up of her head and shoulders shows her glancing apprehensively toward Peter's side of the room; and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand, with the other she slips the strap off her shoulders. She flings her \"slip\" over the blanket. PETER, on his side of the room, looks toward the blanket, and reacts to the \"slip\" coming into sight. Then other undergarments join the \"slip\" on the blanket. \n[94]Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is. \n[95]What's that? \n[96]Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face. ? 245 ? \n[97]Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne. \n[98]Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. \n[99]The pleasure is all mine. There is silence between them for a few seconds. \n[100]I've been thinking about you. \n[101]You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed. Ellie doesn't like the implication, and glares in his direction as Peter's voice continues: \n[102]Goodnight. He also turns his head toward the wall, and the scene fades out. Part Five A long view of the SKY, in the early morning, fades in. In the dim distance there is a speck, which, as it comes nearer, turns out to be an airplane. The drone of its motors becomes louder and louder. Then the view cuts to the CONTROL COCKPIT of the PLANE revealing \n[103]Hey\u0097you not up yet? Come on\u0097come on! \n[104]Eight o'clock. He goes to the blanket which hangs between the two cots and throws something over it to Ellie. \n[105]Here\u0097 \n[106]Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time. \n[107]Listen, Brat\u0097I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself. A close view of ELLIE shows her being stubborn, but alarmed. \n[108]You'll find the showers\u0097and things\u0097right back of the second cottage. (at this Ellie sticks her head over the blanket \n[109]Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside. \n[110]Like what? \n[111]Here\u0097take mine. He flings his robe over to her, and she disappears behind the blanket. \n[112]But make it snappy. Now Ellie has got into his robe, and appears on his side. The robe is too large for her and she makes a comical figure. As she enters, she tries to maintain her customary dignity. \n[113]Hey\u0097you're little, aren't you? \n[114]Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. \n[115]High time you got back. \n[116]Hurry up and get dressed. \n[117]If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer\u0097we'd have been through with breakfast by this time. A close view shows ELLIE in the process of buttoning her dress. She looks up, having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice, which intrigues her. She starts to the other side of the blanket. Then we see her joining Peter in his part of the cabin. \n[118]I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down. \n[119]Egg. One egg\u0097doughnuts\u0097black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? \n[120]I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint. \n[121]What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? \n[122]I thought maybe\u0097uh\u0097\"believe you me\" told you a couple of snappy stories. \n[123]Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut? \n[124]No. No. It's too good a story. \n[125]Yeah? \n[126]Um. You're doing all right. \n[127]One consolation; you can never be lonesome. \n[128]Santa Claus? \n[129]Oh. Is that how you met him? ? 254 ? \n[130]Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school? \n[131]Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it. \n[132]Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk. \n[133]Detectives! \n[134]Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley. ? 255 ? Ellie runs around the room picking up her stuff and murmuring, \"Oh, my goodness!\" She reaches the window. \n[135]Sit down! He rumples her hair and sticks a few hairpins in her mouth. He now stands aside and deliberately talks loud enough to be heard outside. \n[136]Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us. \n[137]The baby is due next month\u0097and they want us to come. Ellie looks up at him, and realizes what he's doing, she nods to him that it's all right, whereupon he removes his hand from her mouth. And now one of the detectives approaches the FRONT DOOR of the cabin. When he hears Peter's voice, he stops to listen. \n[138]Hey, wait a minute! You're talking to my wife! You can't walk in here and\u0097what do you want, anyway? \n[139]Well, look your head off\u0097but don't come bustin' in here. This isn't a public park. While Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered. They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie. \n[140]I got a good mind to sock you right in the nose. \n[141]I wouldn't care if they were the whole police department. They can't come in here and start shooting questions at my wife! \n[142]There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? \n[143]You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you\u0097 \n[144]Oh, so now I was drunk! \n[145]I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him. \n[146]Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family! ? 258 ? \n[147]Well, I hope you find her.  Quit bawling! Quit bawling! The detectives start out, accompanied by Dyke, who is still concerned about the disturbing of his tenants. As they disappear out the door, we hear Dyke's voice: \n[148]It'll be a dirty trick on Aunt Betty if it turns out to be a girl after all. This brings laughter from them both. But Peter suddenly sobers, and he looks at her thoughtfully. ? 259 ? \n[149]Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you? \n[150]We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough\u0097we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one \"The Great Deception.\"[8] \n[151]After that \"The Three Musketeers.\"  I'd make a great D'Artagnan. \n[152]No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe. \n[153]I did! It was my idea, wasn't it? \n[154]If you don't like it, you can resign from the company. \n[155]Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself. They are interrupted by the door being flung open. Dyke sticks his head in the door. \n[156]Holy jumping\u0097! We haven't started to pack yet! And they both scurry around, throwing things carelessly into Peter's suitcase, as the scene fades out. Part Six GORDON'S OFFICE fades in, and Gordon is at his desk as his secretary enters. ? 260 ? \n[157]Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman\u0097a trip like this. \n[158]\"She flies through the air with the greatest of ease. This darin' young maid on the flying trapeze\u0097  Her movements are graceful\u0097all men does she please\u0097\" A close view of the WOMAN and the LITTLE BOY now shows the latter terrifiedly watching his mother, whose head sags wearily. Finally she topples forward in a swoon. \n[159]That's better. You're all right now. Just took a little nose-dive, that's all. He assists her in sitting up. The boy's wailing is heard, and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother. \n[160]Come on, son. Better give your mother a chance to snap out of it.  It's all right, son. She'll be okay in a couple of minutes. He leads the boy away, while Ellie places her arm around the woman. \n[161]What happened to your money? \n[162]Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody? \n[163]Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions. \n[164]Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help. \n[165]Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.  \n[166]Thanks. (he glances from the newspaper to Shapeley, wondering how much he suspects \n[167]That's right. \n[168]Yeah\u0097wouldn't it? \n[169]What? \n[170]Why? ? 267 ? \n[171]What's on your mind? \n[172]You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately. And the view moves with them as Peter leads the way toward a clump of bushes off the side of the road, Shapeley following. They are concealed from the rest of the passengers. \n[173]Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need. \n[174]I can use a smart guy like you. \n[175]Do you pack a gat?[11] A close view of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. \n[176]A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you? \n[177]That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them. ? 268 ? (Shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something he hadn't bargained for, and stares speechlessly at Peter, who continues blandly Expect a little trouble up North. May have to shoot it out with cops. The perspiration starts appearing on Shapeley's brow (as we see him in a close-up). Peter's voice continues: \n[178]Yeah\u0097the \"big boy\"\u0097the Boss of the outfit. \n[179]What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers. \n[180]What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow? \n[181]Sh-sh-sh\u0097! Soft pedal, you mug!\u0097before I\u0097 What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing\u0097and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much. \n[182]Yeah ?\u0097How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you. \n[183]Where do you live? \n[184]Got a couple of kids, huh? \n[185]You love them, don't you? \n[186]You'll keep your trap shut, all right. \n[187]If you don't\u0097Ever hear of Bugs Dooley? \n[188]Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the ? 270 ? river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out. (Shapeley can't stand much more of this. He is ready to keel over \n[189]Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it. \n[190]Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus. \n[191]At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him. \n[192]What's the matter? \n[193]I don't trust that chatterbox. The scene dissolves to the banks of a narrow STREAM at night. Peter is bending over, removing his shoes, and we see the two closer as they talk. \n[194]First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father. \n[195]Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet. \n[196]It takes money to buy food. \n[197]Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene. \n[198]I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now? \n[199]Must be some strange power Westley has over you women. (he now has his shoes off and ties them to each other How do you expect to get there? \n[200]Yeah. \n[201]Aren't you afraid of me? ? 272 ? \n[202]Okay. Hang on to these. As he bends down in front of Ellie, he gets a firm grip around her legs and throws her over his shoulder like a sack. She squeals, terrified, but Peter ignores this; and with his right hand, which is free, he lifts the suitcase and starts walking across the stream. Ellie's first fright is gone and she now rather enjoys the sensation of being carried by Peter. She lets herself go completely limp, still clinging to his shoes, which she carries by the string. As they walk, the dangling shoes keep hitting Peter's backside. \n[203]I wish you'd stop being playful. \n[204]This isn't \"piggy-back.\" \n[205]You're crazy. \n[206]And he carried you like this, I suppose. \n[207]Your father didn't know beans about \"piggy-back\" riding. \n[208]I don't think there's a \"piggy-back\" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good \"piggy-back\" rider. \n[209]To be a \"piggy-backer\" it takes complete relaxation\u0097a warm heart\u0097and a loving nature. \n[210]Not a one. \n[211]Show me a good \"piggy-back\" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance\u0097a natural \"piggy-backer.\"  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about \"piggy-back\" riding that he\u0097 In his excitement he wheels around to speak to her, forgetting that as he turns she goes with him. Not finding her at his right, he swings around to his left. Naturally he takes Ellie with him\u0097and realizing his mistake he mutters: \n[212]Aw, nuts! He proceeds on his way, walking faster than before. They continue this way silently for some time. Finally Ellie breaks the silence. \n[213]Hold this a minute. Ellie takes the suitcase from him, and his hand now free, he delivers a resounding smack on her backside, so that Ellie lets out a yelp. \n[214]Thank you. ? 274 ? The scene dissolves to the edge of a cow PASTURE, at night, and Ellie and Peter are revealed climbing under a barbed wire fence, following which the scene dissolves to a HAYSTACK, in front. Peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout, Ellie watching him. \n[215]This looks like the best spot. \n[216]I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it. And he busies himself laying out a bed for her, pulling hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground. Ellie wanders aim-lessly and then moves to a rock, where she sits and watches Peter. \n[217]What? \n[218]Just your imagination. \n[219]If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you. \n[220]All right. You win. Let's forget it. ? 275 ? \n[221]Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you! This brings silence, and he goes on building a bed for her. Then a close-up of Ellie shows her watching him. Her eyes soften. A very definite interest in him is slowly but surely blossoming, and the fact that he is making her bed adds to the intimacy of the scene. A close view of PETER shows him concentrating on his task, but he pauses a moment and turns to glance at her. It is a devouring look, which he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed. \n[222]If I had any sense, I'd have been in New York by this time. (he emphasizes his feelings by yanking viciously at the hay as both of them are now seen Taking a married woman back to her husband. Hunh! What a prize sucker I turned out to be. (He has her bed ready; without glancing at her Come on\u0097your bed's all ready. She, watches him a moment, then rising slowly, starts toward Peter. Then she stands over her bed, surveying it speculatively. \n[223]Well, take them off. \n[224]All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it. She flashes him a petulant, offended glance but it is lost on Peter, who has his back to her, and meticulously, she slips to her knees and proceeds to stretch out on the hay. The hay bed is bumpy and hard and she has quite a difficult time getting comfortable; her efforts to do so are accompanied by painful sighs. A close view shows PETER stopping to watch her, and his look is sympathetic and solicitous. Then while Ellie groans and sighs and pounds the hay with her palm, Peter steps out of sight. Ellie is unaware of his departure, so busily occupied is she with her makeshift bedding. She squirms around unhappily and finally stretches out, deciding to make the best of it. She lies on her back, her hands clasped under her head, looking up at the stars. \n[225]What's the matter? \n[226]What's got into you? \n[227]I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat. \n[228]Here. Eat your head off. \n[229]Thought you were hungry! \n[230]But what! \n[231]Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy. He kicks the melon viciously out of sight, and without any particular preparation or fuss, he flops down on his bed, following which Ellie goes to her bed and lies down, too. Then a close view of ELLIE appears, and at the moment she looks far removed from the spoiled, pampered, self-reliant brat of Alexander Andrews. Instead, she is a helpless baby, clinging to Peter's protective wing. She'd be ever so grateful right now for a little civility on his part, for a little tenderness and understanding, and she glances over at him, hopefully. PETER, however, stares up at the stars, dreamily; and we then see ELLIE turning away from him, disappointed. Still, the minute Ellie turns her head, Peter looks at her out of the corner of his eye, and it's a long and steady gaze. Then suddenly he gets an idea and rises. He finds his topcoat and goes to her. \n[232]Might get chilly later on.  Better use this. As he bends down to tuck her in, their faces are seen in close proximity. Ellie, tremulous and fearful, has her eyes peeled on him. The situation is imminent with danger; anything is likely to happen at this moment; and she is frightened and expectant\u0097she knows how weak she would be, if he suddenly crushed her in his arms. Peter avoids her gaze. He, too, is a bit shaky. The temptation is there and his resistance is waning. He tucks her in and quickly turns away. Ellie's eyes, however, never leave him. Immediate danger has vanished, and it leaves her a little regretful. A close view of PETER, as he walks over to a rock and sits down, shows him nervously taking out a cigarette and lighting it. \n[233]You've had a lot of men crazy about you, haven't you? ELLIE doesn't respond. She has the scrutinizing, speculative look of a girl who feels herself falling in love with someone who is practically a stranger to her, as a result of which she is ? 278 ? frightened. Then a wider view includes both of them and we see that Peter, too, fights valiantly against a mounting interest in this girl, who epitomizes everything he dislikes. He creates the impression in the following scene that in his analysis of her he is trying to dissuade himself from something he is bound to regret. His attack on her, consequently, is overly vicious. \n[234]I guess you've pretty much had your own way with them. That's your trouble mostly. You've always had your own way. That's why you're such a mess now. He pauses a second, waiting for a protest, but Ellie offers none; she is too much absorbed in her own confusing emotions. A close view then shows PETER taking a long puff on his cigarette and exhaling the smoke, watching it vanish before he speaks. \n[235]You know what generally happens to people like you? You get your values all mixed up. You attach all the importance to the wrong things. Right now, for instance, there's only one thought in your mind\u0097to get back to king Westley. He waits for a reaction, but a close view shows ELLIE absorbed, and she remains silent. Peter's voice continues. \n[236]Sure. \n[237]Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for. ? 279 ? \n[238]I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter? \n[239]I guess not. I'd have given odds it wouldn't mean anything to you. (he goes over and flops down on his own side of hay There were moments when I had hopes. When I\u0097aw, I'm wasting time\u0097You're destined to be a dope the rest of your life.  I pity you. Goodnight. He turns over with a finality that precludes any further discussion, following which a close-up of ELLIE reveals that her eyes are wide open, staring thoughtfully up at the sky. The scene fades out slowly. Part Seven A ROAD fades in. It is day now, and Peter and Ellie are trundling along. Ellie limps, and wears an unhappy expression on her face. \n[240]By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. ? 280 ? \n[241]Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. \n[242]Hitch-hiking. \n[243]A little early yet. No cars out yet. She spies a rock and heads for it. Then we see her seated on the rock. \n[244]No. But I've got a penknife. (he extracts one from his pocket which he snaps open \n[245]There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. \n[246]Carrots. \n[247]Uh-huh. Want one? ? 281 ? \n[248]You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you\u0097carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me\u0097goodnight! \n[249]I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.  \n[250]Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them. \n[251]Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the \"Hitch-Hikers Hail.\" \n[252]You think it's simple, huh? \n[253]Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it\u0097  like this.  But they're all wrong. Never get anywhere. \n[254]But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement\u0097  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see? \n[255]Number two is a wider movement\u0097a smile goes with that one\u0097like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12] \n[256]Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke\u0097and hungry\u0097and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this\u0097  \u0097with a follow through. \n[257]Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it. In the distance a car is heard approaching, and Ellie looks up quickly. \n[258]Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens. Peter steps forward into the road and does his thumb movement. The car approaches, but speeds right by, spreading a cloud of dust in Peter's face, leaving him staring at the departing car, nonplussed. Thereupon ELLIE  glances up at him, a satirical expression on her face. \n[259]Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two. \n[260]I guess maybe I won't write that book after all. \n[261]You! Don't make me laugh. \n[262]What're you going to do? \n[263]What for? ? 284 ? \n[264]Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars. \n[265]Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil? \n[266]All right, let it go. \n[267]No, thanks. We're not hungry. \n[268]No. \n[269]What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13] \n[270]Eat a carrot. \n[271]If you do, I'll break your neck. She looks up at his glowering face, realizes he means it, and wilts under his dominant gaze. \n[272]Let's get out and stretch our legs. Peter gets out, followed by Ellie, and they walk away from the car. Both are silent. At the DOOR of the LUNCH WAGON, then, Danker comes out and looks around furtively. Ellie and Peter, as seen by him, appear, walking away, following which the view moves over to the Ford and drops down to a close-up of Peter's suitcase. Now Danker looks about quickly and starts toward his car. He springs into the car, steps on the starter, and is off. ELLIE and PETER hear the motor. They wheel around, and their eyes widen in surprise. ? 286 ? \n[273]Hey! He flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford. He is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road. Peter continues the pursuit. This scene wiping off, the FORD now makes its appearance around the bend, and as it approaches, Peter is seen at the wheel. He looks like he's just been through a fight. And as Peter rides in, Ellie comes running toward him. \n[274]Come on\u0097get in. \n[275]Come on! come on! (at this she runs around to get in the other side \n[276]Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!  \n[277]A black eye.  A close view shows Peter and Ellie driving along in the Ford. Peter looks ahead, uncommunicatively. Ellie glances up at him, and it is plain that something's on her mind. \n[278]You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it. \n[279]Haven't much gas left in this thing. Got to start promoting some.  Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat. Ought to be good for ten gallons. The scene fades out. Part Eight ANDREWS' STUDY fades in, affording a close view of King Westley. He answers every description we have had of him. He is a stiff, handsome, stuffed-shirt gigolo. He sits in a chair, leaning on a cane, his gloves loosely in his hand. The view then moves back to reveal Andrews, who, from the opening of the scene, is speaking as he paces around the room. \n[280]Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room. ? 289 ? \n[281]Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning. \n[282]I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours. \n[283]Okay.  Cottage Number Three. As they start toward it, the scene cuts to the OWNER'S CABIN. The owner of the auto camp and his wife are standing at window, looking out. She is a hatchet-faced shrew. He is meek and docile. \n[284]Well, here we are on the last lap. Ellie crosses to the window and stares out moodily. Peter removes several things from his suitcase and lays them on the bed. There is a strained silence between them, as both are lost in their own thoughts. A close view of PETER as he putters abstractedly with the contents of his bag creates the impression that he empties it tonight rather ruefully. It somehow spells finis to their adventure. \n[285]Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms of your husband. ELLIE  turns away from the window and looks at Peter. She stares this way for a long moment before speaking. \n[286]Yeah, swell. Peter takes the rope out of his bag. It is the one used for the \"Walls of Jericho\" previously. He lays it aside and then, remembering, retrieves it. For a moment he holds it in his hand, speculatively; then turning, proceeds to tack it up. The noise of the tacking attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie turns and looks toward Peter. \n[287]We certainly outsmarted your father.  I guess you ought to be happy. There is no response from her, a close view revealing that she quite obviously isn't happy. They are now separated by the blanket, and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket. \n[288]Nope. \n[289]I don't make it a policy to run around with married women. A close-up of Ellie, disclosing only her neck and shoulders, shows her slipping out of her clothes. She pauses\u0097then looks up. \n[290]What do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn't I?  That's what you wanted, wasn't it? ELLIE is already in bed, staring up at the ceiling. \n[291]I probably did the world a great favor at that. Got two pinheads out of circulation.  Cupid thinks he's doing something when he brings two lovers together. What good's that? I'm bringing two pains-in-the-neck together. I think I'll start an institution\u0097hang out a shingle. The view now widens to include both sides of the blanket. Ellie doesn't hear a word of Peter's attack. She is too intent on her own thoughts. \n[292]Me? ? 292 ? \n[293]Maybe.  Sure\u0097sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd\u0097  Yeah, but where you going to find her\u0097somebody that's real\u0097somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more. ELLIE'S disappointment is apparent. \n[294]I've even been sucker enough to make plans.  I saw an island in the Pacific once. Never been able to forget it. That's where I'd like to take her. But she'd have to be the sort of a girl that'd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nights\u0097and love it as much as I did.  You know, those nights when you and the moon and the water all become one\u0097when something comes over you\u0097and you feel that you're part of something big and marvelous.  Those are the only places to live. Where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around. A close-up of ELLIE at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heaven\u0097from which she is excluded, as she listens to him continuing. \n[295]I'm going to Swim in the surf with her\u0097I'm going to reach up and grab stars for her\u0097I'm going to laugh with her\u0097and cry with her. I'm going to kiss her wet lips\u0097and\u0097 Suddenly stopping, he turns his head slowly, sensing Ellie's nearness; and the view, drawing back to include Ellie, shows her standing at his bedside, looking down at him yearningly. Then we see them close together: Peter's face is immobile. Ellie drops to her knees. ? 293 ? \n[296]Better go back to your bed. \n[297]You're forgetting you're married. \n[298]Better go back to your bed. There is a lengthy pause, neither of them stirs. Then Ellie slowly raises her tear-stained face and gets to her feet. \n[299]Hey, Brat\u0097!  Did you mean that? Would you really go? (he waits for a response, but none comes. He tries again Hey, Brat\u0097 He listens\u0097all is quiet. He slips his covers off and crosses to the blanket, and peers over it. She is asleep. Her tear-stained face rests on the pillow, her arm extends over her head. It is a childlike posture. PETER is watching her tenderly. He speculates whether to awaken her and decides against it. He starts away. Peter tiptoes around the room for a few moments, deep in thought. Then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind begins to take form, he hastily begins dressing. The scene dissolving, Peter is seen completely clothed and starting for the door when he thinks of something. He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out into the night. Thereupon the scene wipes off, disclosing a Gas Station along the road at night. Here Peter is talking to a station attendant. \n[300]All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars. \n[301]Listen, man\u0097I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say? \n[302]What? \n[303]Well, you got one now. \u0097Come on, fill 'er up. While he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of Peter driving furiously, a broad, happy grin on his face, following which several scenes wipe off in succession (denoting the passage of time) \u0097scenes of Peter driving at high speed, causing several cows to amble out of the way; of the CAR driving into the Holland Tunnel, and of the BACK ROOM of a SPEAKEASY where Peter stands in ? 295 ? front of a small desk upon which there is a typewriter. Near him is a swarthy Italian. \n[304]Fine! That's fine, Tony. Now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour. \n[305]Hello, Agnes. \n[306]I haven't been shot at for days. In GORDON'S OFFICE, Gordon is at his desk. He looks up when Peter enters. \n[307]Wait a minute, Gordon\u0097I\u0097 \n[308]Joe, listen\u0097 \n[309]Okay, Joe. Listen\u0097you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn\u0097anytime I ran into a story that looked good\u0097I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe. \n[310]That's it.  I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars. Upon hearing this GORDON is ready to jump out of his skin. \n[311]Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars\u0097and I need it quick. I'm in a jam. \n[312]To tear down the Walls of Jericho. \n[313]Never mind . . . Listen\u0097suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. \n[314]That she's going to marry somebody else. \n[315]Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you? \n[316]Well, I got it, Joe. ? 297 ? \n[317]It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. \n[318]Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! \n[319]Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either. \n[320]I am, Joe. \n[321]Yeah. \n[322]For heaven's sake, Joe\u0097stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. Gordon is affected by the sincere note in Peter's voice. \n[323]I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe. \n[324]Listen, Pal\u0097you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he? While Peter has been speaking Gordon stares into space thoughtfully. \n[325]Thanks, Pal. You saved my life. ? 301 ? \n[326]'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action. \n[327]\"I found a million dollar baby\u0097\" He is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark, whistling its strange melody. Peter listens to it a second time, then answers its call by imitating it. The meadowlark whistles again, and peter is highly amused. \n[328]Okay, pal. Be seein' you. Just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance. Peter glances back, and as the sirens come nearer, he pulls over to the side of the road. There follows a full view of the ROAD, with peter in the foreground at the side as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens. Thereupon PETER gets an idea. \n[329]Come on, Dobbin, old boy. We got a police escort. ? 304 ? He applies the gas and shoots out of sight, following which a full view of the road shows Peter's car trying to catch up with the parade. It outdistances him, however, and we see PETER in the Ford pressing his body forward to help the car make time. His foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor. But the police cars are now out of sight, and Peter gives up. \n[330]Dobbin, me lad. You failed muh. I'm afraid you're gittin' old. Thereupon the scene dissolves to a small town ROAD, where at the door of a Sheriff's office a policeman is standing on guard. The reporters hang around in front of him. Several yokels look on. The limousine and motor cycles are at the curb. And now, in a closer view, at the DOOR the policeman on guard steps aside as the door opens and Ellie, her father, and King Westley emerge. King has his arm around her. The moment they appear in the doorway, cameras click and several reporters surround them. \n[331]Take it easy, Dobbin. Remember your blood pressure. We find Peter directly in front of a slow moving freight train. Several hoboes stick their heads out of a car, and Peter waves to them. The hoboes look puzzled for a minute and then wave back. The view then swings over to an opening between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on the other side, apparently on its way back. PETER amuses himself by talking to an old flagman. \n[332]Better get that toy train out of here. I'm in a hurry. The Flagman grins at him in reply. By this time the last car is in sight, and Peter gets all set to move. He stops, however, to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform. In the meantime, the motorcycles have started forward, and the sirens begin their low, moaning wail. Peter, attracted, turns, and over Peter's shoulder we see the parade starting. As the limousine ? 305 ? passes, we get a glimpse of the inside. Ellie lies back on King Westley's shoulder. He has his arm around her as they pass out of sight. Thereupon a close view of PETER shows him reacting to what he saw. He turns his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car, a look of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes. Slowly he turns his head forward, staring ahead of him blankly; he can't quite make it out. Then gradually the significance of it all strikes him\u0097and his mouth curls up bitterly. The scene wiping off, a series of NEWSPAPER HEADLINES come into view: \n[333]See that he gets that, will you, Agnes? Tell him I was just kidding.  As Agnes stares after him, puzzled, Gordon dashes in from a back door. \n[334]Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you. \n[335]Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it? \n[336]Yeah, where am I? \n[337]Thanks, Joe. He leaves, Gordon watching him sympathetically, and the scene fades out. Part Nine The LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE fades in. It is morning and at the moment the place is a beehive of activity. Dozens of butlers and maids hustle around setting tables. Floral decorations are being hung by men on ladders. In the background on a platform, a twenty-piece orchestra is getting ready, accompanied by the scraping of chairs, adjusting of music stands, unpacking of instruments. The scene cuts to ANDREWS' STUDY: King Westley is seated, and Andrews walks around him. They are both dressed in striped trousers, frock coat, etc. \n[338]Hello . . . Yes? . . . Who? . . . Oh . . . Why can't I see you at your office? The scene cuts to ANDREWS' STUDY, affording a close view of ANDREWS at the phone. ? 317 ? \n[339]Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me\u0097those things give me a stiff pain. \n[340]No\u0097no. What the deuce do I want to\u0097 His eyes fall on something, and there follows a close view of a tabloid newspaper, featuring the heading: \"Love Triumphant\" and containing the pictures of Ellie and King. The view then moves down to feature headline reading \"Groom to Land on Bride's Lawn.\" \"King Westley plans to drop in an autogyro on the lawn of Andrews estate . . .\" Peter's mouth screws up disdainfully. \n[341]Yeah, wait a minute. Maybe I will come over. I'd like to get a load of that three-ring circus you're pulling. I want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant. I haven't had a good laugh in a week. (he is still at the phone as the scene dissolves Then the LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE dissolves in. It is now filled with guests, who wander around, chattering gaily. The orchestra plays. A captain of waiters in the foreground instructs his men. \n[342]Keep your eye on my car when you're backing up, you guys. And as he goes, the chauffeurs look at each other, surprised. The scene dissolves to ANDREWS' STUDY, where a butler stands in front of Andrews who is seated at his desk. ? 318 ? \n[343]Yeah. \n[344]That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami\u0097  for the love of it? \n[345]Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose. \n[346]If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. ? 319 ? (and he throws the paper on Andrews' desk ANDREWS picks up the paper and glances at it. After a moment, he looks at Peter, studying him interestedly; then he returns to the paper, and reads its contents: \"Cash outlay 8.60 Topcoat 15.00 Suitcase 7.50 Hat 4.00 3 shirts 4.50 Total 39.60\" Andrews looks up from the paper. This is a twist he hadn't anticipated, and he doesn't quite know how to handle it. \n[347]I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in. \n[348]Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted. \n[349]What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars! \n[350]What ten thousand? \n[351]Who said anything about a reward! \n[352]All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters. \n[353]We'll go into that some other time. \n[354]Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege. \n[355]Yeah\u0097with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it? A close-up indicates that ANDREWS has been studying Peter throughout the scene. He is now completely won over. \n[356]A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined. \n[357]She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day\u0097whether it's coming to her or not. A close view of the TWO shows Andrews smiling: Here is a man! \n[358]If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself\u0097long ago. ? 321 ? \n[359]A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing! \n[360]Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself. He snaps the door open and goes out, following which ANDREWS is seen watching the door, his eyes twinkling, and the scene cuts to the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY as Peter comes through, moving on to the front door. But just as he reaches it, Ellie enters, accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in her hand. They see each other almost simultaneously, and both stop, glaring. \n[361]Perfect! Now you look natural. At this Ellie leaves her group and comes toward Peter, and a close view shows them together, glaring at each other. \n[362]You bet I did. \n[363]Same to you. \n[364]I would. But I've got a weak stomach. He wheels around and goes through the door, Ellie looking after him, her eyes blazing. The drone of a plane motor outside is heard, and several people rush down the stairs, all excited. ", "ELLIE": "\n[1]What do you want? Andrews doesn't stir from the door. \n[2]I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you. She lights a cigarette. Andrews watches her a moment. \n[3]Why don't you put me in chains? \n[4]All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want! But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat! She stares petulantly out at the blue sky, but Andrews comes over and sits beside her. \n[5]I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it! \n[6]Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because\u0097 \n[7]You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him. \n[8]How many times have I told you not to bring any food in here. The waiters back up, frightened, but Andrews saves them. \n[9]Smart, aren't you! So subtle. ? 212 ? \n[10]You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat! \n[11]I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe. Andrews eats silently while Ellie rants at him, walking around and puffing vigorously on her cigarette. \n[12]Most humiliating thing ever happened to me.  A bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car! That crowd outside the justice of the peace\u0097must have thought I was a criminal\u0097or something. A close view of ANDREWS intercuts with part of Ellie's speech. At the end of her speech he smacks his lips, enjoying the food with too great a relish. Then the two are seen together. \n[13]Where are you taking me? \n[14]South America! \n[15]You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat. \n[16]What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married! \n[17]You'll never do it! You can't do it! \n[18]What've you got against King Westley? \n[19]You only met him once . \n[20]You talk as if he were a gigolo\u0097or something. \n[21]He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan. \n[22]Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men\u0097particularly if you're a shining example. ? 214 ? He grins, not at all offended, knowing she doesn't mean it. \n[23]Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing. \n[24]You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it! And as Andrews ignores her, she starts moving around the table toward him.\u0097Next she appears sitting on the edge of Andrews' chair, and she throws her arm around his shoulder. \n[25]Aw, listen, Dad. Let's not fight like this any more. I know you're worried about me\u0097and want me to be happy. And I love you for it. But please try to understand. You're not being fair, darling. This isn't just a crazy impulse of mine. King and I talked about it a lot before we decided to get married. Look\u0097why can't we give it a trial\u0097let's say\u0097for a year or so. If it's wrong, King and I will be the first to know it. We can get a divorce, can't we? Now, be a dear, and let me off the boat. Keeping me prisoner like this is so silly. Andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech, giving no indication of his feelings in the matter. \n[26]I come from a long line of stubborn idiots! \n[27]I won't thank you! I'll never thank you! ? 215 ? \n[28]I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to. \n[29]Thanks.  The scene dissolves to the DECK of the YACHT as Ellie's pursuers clamber aboard, Andrews waiting for them. \n[30]Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. (she takes the ticket and change from the old lady, and hands her a bill Here. \n[31]When does the bus leave? \n[32]Thank you. She picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurries away. She crosses to the entrance of the waiting room and disappears through the doors. The view then wings over to a telephone booth near the entrance. Clustered around the booth are half a dozen men of varied appearance. The inside of the booth is lighted, and a young man, Peter Warne, waves his hands wildly as he shouts into the phone, although it is impossible to hear what he is saying. A close inspection of the men surrounding the booth (the scene contracting to a close view) reveals them as being slightly and happily intoxicated. A short man approaches the door of the booth. ? 218 ? \n[33]I beg your pardon! \n[34]Driver! The driver, who has stopped to witness this new altercation, returns. \n[35]Are those seats reserved? \n[36]Thank you. (Peter, thwarted for a moment, just glares at her \n[37]Tell that man not to drive so fast. (at which Peter just cocks his head slightly \n[38]Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly. Peter stares at her a moment, resenting her officious manner. \n[39]I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested. \n[40]Oh, my heavens! It's gone! ? 226 ? \n[41]What happened? \n[42]What am I going to do now? \n[43]No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. \n[44]Why, no\u0097I\u0097  Yes . . . I guess I will. \n[45]No. I'd rather you didn't. \n[46]I don't want it reported! \n[47]See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs! I want to be left alone. (with which she disappears from the scene A close-up of PETER shows him glaring after her. ? 227 ? \n[48]Oh, I'm sorry\u0097  Silly, isn't it? She looks around, and her finding herself alone with Peter adds to her embarrassment. \n[49]Everybody's gone. She lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious of his coat over her which slips. She stares at it thoughtfully for a moment\u0097then at Peter. \n[50]Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we? \n[51]That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away? \n[52]No, thank you.  Thank you so much. Most uncomfortably, she edges away from him toward the front of the bus, Peter watching her leave, his interest definitely provoked. The scene cuts to the STAND as Ellie emerges from the bus. At the foot of the steps is the driver. \n[53]How much time have I? \n[54]I'm going over to the Windsor Hotel. Peter appears in the door of the bus in the background, and a close view then shows him stopping to listen as he sees Ellie talking to the driver. ? 229 ? \n[55]Yes. I may be a few minutes late. She disappears from sight, leaving the driver staring at her, dumbly; and Peter, standing in back of the driver, shakes his head in amazement. The scene dissolves to the BUS STAND later that morning\u0097at the same spot where the bus had previously been. It is no longer there, however. A huge crowd fills the space, and the view moving down through the crowd, singles Ellie out. She has just arrived and looks around helplessly. Finally she spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him. \n[56]Where's the bus to New York? \n[57]Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus\u0097I told them to wait! \n[58]Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York? ? 230 ? \n[59]Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours! \n[60]What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too. Peter looks at her a moment before replying. \n[61]Don't tell me you did it on my account!  I hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is\u0097  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself. \n[62]My ticket? \n[63]Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket. ? 231 ? While she is putting the ticket away in her purse, Peter speaks: \n[64]What are you talking about? \n[65]Will you please tell me what you're raving about! \n[66]You must have me confused with\u0097 \n[67]I didn't ask for your advice.  \n[68]You're not going to notify my father, are you? \n[69]If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. (a disdainful expression crosses his face \n[70]Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. \n[71]Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. (this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer \n[72]Believe you me, you bore me to distraction. ? 236 ? (but Shapeley merely throws his head back and emits his characteristic guffaw \n[73]If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you. \n[74]Here, boy! \n[75]No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would. \n[76]A box of chocolates, please. \n[77]Of course I do. What do you mean\u0097 \n[78]You have your nerve!  Here, boy\u0097! Peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money out. Ellie stares at him dumbfounded. \n[79]That's none of your business. \n[80]Now, just a minute\u0097you can't\u0097 \n[81]Are you talking to me! \n[82]Darn clever, these Armenians. \n[83]I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband. \n[84]Oh, you did? What am I expected to do\u0097leap for joy? \n[85]Your ego is colossal. \n[86]Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited\u0097 \n[87]A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you? \n[88]Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this. \n[89]Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but\u0097 you've been very kind. (but the rain outside causes her to hesitate \n[90]That, I suppose, makes everything\u0097uh\u0097quite all right. \n[91]You're not really serious about this, are you? \n[92]Smart aleck! And thoroughly exasperated, she goes behind the blanket, and plops on the cot. She sits on the edge, debating what to do, feeling herself trapped. Her impulse is to leave, if only to show this smart aleck he's not dealing with a child, and she rises impetuously and moves to the window. A close view at the WINDOW shows her looking out. The downpour has not abated one bit, and the heavy raindrops clatter against the window pane in a sort of challenge to Ellie, whose jaw drops. She turns slowly back to the room, and as she does so her eyes light on the cot. It looks most inviting; after all, she hasn't had any rest for two nights. She falls on the cot again, her shoulders sagging wearily. Following this, the view reveals both sides of the blanket. Peter is already in his pajamas. \n[93]You haven't got a trumpet by any chance, have you? PETER gets the idea and smiles broadly. \n[94]Do you mind putting out the light? \n[95]Oh, by the way\u0097what's your name? \n[96]Who are you? \n[97]You've got a name, haven't you? \n[98]Peter Warne? I don't like it. \n[99]Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne . . . \n[100]Goodnight, Mr. Warne.  \n[101]Darn planes\u0097 She squirms around uncomfortably, and finding it impossible to resume her slumber, opens her eyes. The sun pouring in through the window causes her to squint. She sits up and stares outside, puzzled. Then remembering where she is she looks toward the other side of the cabin, listening for some sign of life. But there is none ? 248 ? and she relaxes. She falls back on the pillow, pulling the covers over her. Now PETER enters from the outside with an armful of foodstuffs, which he dumps on the table. He looks toward Ellie. \n[102]What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. (noticing her dress hanging freshly pressed You\u0097you had it pressed. \n[103]Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? (at this the view moves with him and he goes to the blanket \n[104]Why, you bully. I believe you would. \n[105]I'm out! I'm out! ? 249 ? And she jumps out of bed, throwing the cover around herself, following which Peter is seen going back to the table. \n[106]Outside! \n[107]I can't go out like this. \n[108]Like this. I have no robe. \n[109]Where'd you say the showers\u0097and things\u0097were?  \n[110]Where is the shower? \n[111]I'll find it myself. She slams the door viciously, but Peter rushes over to the window to watch her; and as viewed by him, Ellie appears next walking to the showers outside the cabin. She holds her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances. Then in the cabin, at the window, Peter watching Ellie, chuckles at her, shaking his head in amusement. He starts toward the table, and the scene cuts to a moving view outside ? 250 ? the cabins, with Ellie walking past several cottages on her way to the showers. Several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her destination. There are two wooden shacks adjoining, each having a sign on them; one reads, \"Showers\u0097Men\"\u0097the other, \"Showers\u0097Women.\" In front of the women's shower there are several unappetizing-looking fat women waiting, and with them is a small girl. Ellie crosses over to the women's shower and disappears inside, the waiting women staring at her, puzzled. A moment elapses and Ellie backs out, being pushed by a woman, part of whose naked body is visible, and whose voice is heard in protest: \n[112]If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours. \n[113]Get out! \n[114]I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files. She disappears behind the blanket, following which we see Peter's side of the cabin, while Ellie's voice continues from behind the blanket. \n[115]I saw the little Pussinfoos girl. She's turned out quite a charming creature. Peter ignores her chatter, except for an annoyed glance once in a while. \n[116]Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute? \n[117]Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends? ? 252 ? \n[118]Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to. \n[119]Thank you. (sitting down to the table; referring to the food My, my! Scrambled eggs. \n[120]Nope. No complaints. \n[121]Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. \n[122]Must be the Spring. \n[123]He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married. ? 253 ? \n[124]Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything. \n[125]Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man! \n[126]It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken. \n[127]Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun. \n[128]It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I\u0097I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it? \n[129]King\u0097King Westley was in it. \n[130]Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. (she has been \"dunking\" her doughnut throughout this, Peter watching her \n[131]Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk. \n[132]Thanks, professor. \n[133]I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day. But before he can answer, they are interrupted by voices directly outside their window, and the view moves with Peter as he goes to the door, which he opens slightly. Thereupon Dyke is seen in conversation with two men outside the CABIN. \n[134]That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do? \n[135]Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me? \n[136]What are you talking about? At this, Peter rushes over to her and clamps his hand over her mouth. \n[137]Come in! The moment she does, Peter rushes behind the hanging blanket. He has his head stuck over it, waiting for the detective to enter, and the moment the door opens Peter ducks. The detective takes a step inside the room. ? 256 ? \n[138]There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart. \n[139]Are you addressing me? \n[140]Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question. \n[141]Well, you don't have to lose your temper! \n[142]He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times! The two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other two, who are now out of sight. \n[143]Well, you were! \n[144]Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested! \n[145]Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute. Ellie goes over to her cot, and starts picking up her hat and things, whereupon Dyke, very much affected, turns to the detectives. \n[146]You weren't so bad yourself. \n[147]Next week \"East Lynne.\" \n[148]How about Cinderella\u0097or a real hot love story? \n[149]Oh, you are! Who made you the manager? \n[150]You always want to run everything. \n[151]I refuse to resign! \n[152]Peter!  There's something the matter with that woman. She looks ill. Peter follows her gaze, whereupon we see the WOMAN. Her head rolls weakly, a pained expression on her face. \n[153]I better go over and see her. \n[154]Yes. We see the other passengers around Ellie and Peter enjoying themselves. One of them pokes her. \n[155]Thank the man for me, Peter. This is the first comfortable position I've had all night. Peter, amused, is assisting her to her feet. The guitarist has continued his playing uninterrupted, and as Peter lifts Ellie, he sings: \n[156]You'd better rest. It's been a hard trip, hasn't it? The scene cuts to a close view of SHAPELEY who has his eye peeled on Peter, watching him, and we next see Peter and the boy, who is still sobbing quietly. They are now standing away from the other passengers. \n[157]She'll be all right, soon's she gets something to eat. Peter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket for a smaller one. Before he can find anything, however, Ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy. \n[158]Here, boy\u0097first town we come to, buy some food. ? 265 ? (Peter glances at the empty hand and then at Ellie \n[159]Just don't tell her anything about it. You don't want her to get sick again, do you? \n[160]Come on. Let's go back to your mother. She leaves with the boy, Peter watching her a moment, impressed by her display of humanness, before turning and leaving the scene, following which a close-up shot of SHAPELEY watching Peter, then also rising and starting out. On the ROAD, the driver is now standing in front of the mud-hole, staring at the sunken wheel dolefully, as several people stray into the scene. \n[161]Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that. \n[162]Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch! \n[163]I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus? ? 271 ? \n[164]Not as long as I'm alive. \n[165]What do you mean\u0097starvation? \n[166]Why, haven't you\u0097? \n[167]You didn't give that boy all your money? \n[168]Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way. \n[169]To New York? \n[170]I'm following you. \n[171]No. \n[172]Sorry. (Peter takes several more laborious steps before either of them speaks \n[173]It's the first time I've ridden \"piggy-back\" in years. \n[174]Of course it is. \n[175]I remember distinctly Father taking me for a \"piggy-back\" ride\u0097 \n[176]Yes. \n[177]My uncle\u0097Mother's brother\u0097had four children . . . and I've seen them ride \"piggy-back.\" ? 273 ? \n[178]That's silly. \n[179]And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose. \n[180]You're prejudiced. \n[181]My father was a great \"piggy-backer.\" Peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust, then calmly hands his suitcase to her. \n[182]We're not going to sleep out here, are we? \n[183]Peter\u0097 \n[184]No, it isn't. I'm hungry and\u0097and scared. \n[185]Well, I am. \n[186]Not if you're more hungry than scared. \n[187]I can't forget it. I'm still hungry. \n[188]I'll get my clothes all wrinkled. \n[189]What! \n[190]You're becoming terribly disagreeable lately. Snap my head off every time I open my mouth. ? 276 ? (she waits for a reply, but receives none If being with me is so distasteful to you, you can leave.  You can leave any time you see fit. Nobody's keeping you her.  I can get along. She waits a second and then turns to see what effect this has on him. The fact that Peter is gone doesn't quite register at first. She looks around calmly, then is puzzled, and finally she becomes panicky. She sits up with a start. \n[191]Peter\u0097 (there is a pause while she listens, but nothing stirs, and there is more apprehension in her voice Peter! Real terror comes into her face, and she is ready to cry. She gets to her feet. \n[192]Peter!! At this he comes running into the scene; under his arm he has a watermelon. \n[193]Oh, Peter\u0097 (she throws her arms around his neck and sobs freely \n[194]Oh, Peter! I was so scared. With his free hand he removes her arm from around his neck and starts away. \n[195]I know\u0097but\u0097 ? 277 ? \n[196]I don't want it now. \n[197]I was\u0097but\u0097 \n[198]I was so scared\u0097that it scared\u0097 \n[199]Do you know? \n[200]What? \n[201]Try me. \n[202]You sound like a hobo. \n[203]Doesn't sound very exciting. PETER, seen close, looks at her for a long time before speaking: \n[204]What are you thinking about? \n[205]Really? \n[206]What'd you say we're supposed to be doing? \n[207]Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking\u0097  where does the hitching come in? \n[208]If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. (Peter comes over, sets his bag down, and prepares to wait Got a toothpick? \n[209]Hay\u0097in my teeth. She points to her front teeth, and Peter flicks the hay out of her teeth. \n[210]Needn't rub it in. (Peter takes a carrot out of his coat pocket and starts nibbling on it; Ellie looks up at this What're you eating? \n[211]Raw? \n[212]No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. \n[213]I hate the horrid stuff. While she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed. Peter and Ellie both jump up. \n[214]What if nobody stops for us? \n[215]You're an expert, I suppose. \n[216]There's no end to your accomplishments. \n[217]Oh, no! \n[218]Tch! Tch! I'm sorry for the poor things. ? 282 ? \n[219]Clever. \n[220]You figured that all out yourself, huh? \n[221]Amazing. \n[222]Here comes a car! \n[223]I'm still watching your thumb. Peter is still looking after the car. ? 283 ? \n[224]When you get up to a hundred, wake me up. Another car is heard coming, and Peter steps forward, prepared to hail it. Then this dissolves to a long view of the ROAD as a stream of cars of every description speeds forward (\"toward the camera\") and vanishes. The view moving in to the side of the road, Peter is seen still in the same spot. He waves his arms, jerks his thumb, indulges in all sorts of gyrations, while Ellie remains slumped on her rock, completely worn out. Now Ellie watches Peter out of the corner of her eye, her face expressionless. Peter continues his arm waving\u0097but slows down like a mechanical toy which has run out. He finally gets down to just thumbing his nose at the passing vehicles; and then thoroughly wearied, he flops down on a rock near Ellie. \n[225]Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try? \n[226]You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car\u0097and I won't use my thumb. The scene widens as she rises and steps forward. \n[227]Mind your own business. She lifts her skirt to above her knees and pretends to be fixing her garter. Her very attractive leg is in full display. Almost instantly, we hear the screaming and grinding of quickly applied brakes, and Peter looks up astonished. The scene wiping off, we then get a closer view of Ellie and Peter sitting in the back of an open Ford. It is a broken-down, rickety affair of the 1920 vintage. Ellie grins victoriously up at Peter, who stares ahead of him, glumly. \n[228]You might give me a little credit. \n[229]I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb. \n[230]We don't need forty cars. Peter glares at her, and Ellie's eyes twinkle mischievously, following which we get a wider view which includes the driver of the car, Danker. He is a man of about thirty, a heavy set, loose chinned person; at the moment he is singing an aria from some opera. He suddenly stops, turning to Ellie and Peter in the back seat. \n[231]Why, I think that would be\u0097 \n[232]Why not? I'm hungry. \n[233]Never!  I'm going in and ask him\u0097 \n[234]Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right? \n[235]Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on\u0097 \n[236]What happened? \n[237]What'd you give him for the car? \n[238]Look\u0097uh\u0097how are the\u0097uh\u0097carrots holding out? Any left? Peter glances at her. He knows what a concession this is on her part, and he smiles sympathetically. \n[239]Darling! ? 287 ? She reaches up and kisses his cheek, and Peter beams happily. \n[240]Any luck? \n[241]What about money? \n[242]That's swell! \n[243]I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed. \n[244]Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you? \n[245]Is that the Walls of Jericho going up? \n[246]Thank you. (there is silence while Peter starts undressing \n[247]Am I going to see you in New York? ? 291 ? \n[248]Why not? PETER glances up at the \"Walls of Jericho\" and after a speculative pause, speaks quietly. \n[249]No harm in your coming to see us. \n[250]Won't I ever see you again? PETER  is now getting into his pajamas. \n[251]Peter, have you ever been in love? PETER crawls into bed. \n[252]Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love? \n[253]Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy. \n[254]Take me with you, Peter. Take me to your island. I want to do all those things you talked about. Peter stares at her lovely face. His heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms. \n[255]I love you. \n[256]I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter\u0097 Sobbing, she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms around him. All is quiet for a moment as Ellie's head rests on his breast, while Peter struggles with an overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her. \n[257]I'm sorry. She turns and disappears behind the blanket. Peter remains motionless. Then a close view shows Ellie, as she gets into bed, sobbing quietly. She hides her face in the pillow to suppress her sobs. It is the first time in her life that she has been so deeply hurt. A close view next shows Peter reaching over for a cigarette, which he lights. All his movements are thoughtful, meditative. He leans back and stares at the ceiling, until we see only the cigarette in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke. This dissolving, the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down, a long, frail ash hanging perilously on. Peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a tray. He leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is quiet. Then glancing over in Ellie's direction, he calls to her: ? 294 ? \n[258]owner and his wife come up to her; timidly\u0097sitting up What's the matter? \n[259]Husband? \n[260]Isn't he here? \n[261]Why, he'll be back. \n[262]Why\u0097no. \n[263]Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the\u0097 ? 300 ? \n[264]But can't you wait until morning\u0097 \n[265]Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York. \n[266]Oh, hello, Dad. \n[267]Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. (to hide her confusion, she reaches for a cigarette \n[268]Stunt? \n[269]Oh, yes. I heard. \n[270]Huh?  Oh\u0097the gown\u0097  Yes, it's beautiful. ? 311 ? \n[271]Nothing. (she walks over to table and crushes her cigarette \n[272]Oh, no. \n[273]Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that. She moves away from him and sits on the sofa, and Andrews watches her a moment and crosses over to her. He sits beside her, placing an arm affectionately around her shoulder. \n[274]On the road. \n[275]No. \n[276]I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him. \n[277]It'll do no good.  He despises me. \n[278]He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere. \n[279]He doesn't think so much of you either. ? 313 ? \n[280]He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly. \n[281]He's marvelous! \n[282]I don't know. \n[283]It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.  \n[284]No, I'll go through with it. \n[285]It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you\u0097made your life so miserable\u0097and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember. A close-up of ANDREWS shows him watching Ellie, as her voice continues. \n[286]Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again. \n[287]Yes. Peter Warne. She starts to walk away when she is attracted by her father's surprise at the mention of the name. \n[288]Why? Do you know him? (but Andrews withdraws his hand. Apparently he has changed his mind \n[289]You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad? \n[290]Oh, please, Dad\u0097 She has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter, which she hurriedly opens and reads, following which we see a LETTER in Peter's handwriting. It is addressed to: \"Alexander Andrews, 11 Wall Street.\" It reads: \"Dear Sir: I should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with your daughter. Peter Warne.\" Ellie is then seen reading and re-reading the note. Her face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete disillusionment. ? 315 ? \n[291]Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward. \n[292]Are you going to see him? \n[293]Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets. She paces agitatedly, Andrews watching her silently. He knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be. Mary now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table. \n[294]Thanks, Mary. That's just what I need.  \n[295]Fine\u0097Fine! Have him come in. \n[296]Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King. A close view of the Two shows King taking her in his arms. \n[297]Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us . ? 316 ? (she drains the glass; pouring another, as she continues We finally made it, didn't we? \n[298]It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going. \n[299]I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it\u0097the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.  In ANDREWS' STUDY, Andrews walks around the room, perceptibly affected by his visit with Ellie. He keeps turning Peter's letter over in his hand, apparently debating in his mind what to do with it. He finally gets an idea\u0097and determinedly crosses to the phone. Then the scene cuts to a HOTEL ROOM. First there is a close-up of a NEWSPAPER\u0097a tabloid bearing a heading which reads: \"LOVE \n[300]I hope you got your money. \n[301]Congratulations. \n[302]Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely. \n[303]I don't want to hear anything about him! She walks away from him, and Andrews, frustrated, looks at her helplessly. Thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view of the LAWN. The orchestra is playing Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The lawn is crowded with guests. In the background we see the autogyro idling. A closer view shows a small platform, serving as an altar. Over it there is an arbor of roses. Back of the altar stands a minister, ready. A reverse view reveals a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading to the house. Both sides are lined with guests, who are murmuring excitedly. At the moment, King Westley and his best man are marching solemnly toward the altar. Back of the altar we see a high platform upon which are several newsreel men who are grinding their cameras. The guests, of whom close glimpses are caught, are now peering over each other's shoulders. King and his best man have reached the altar, and the music of the wedding march comes to a stop. The orchestra leader is looking around, apparently waiting for a signal. At the DOOR of the HOUSE a very \"prissy\" middle-aged man waves his handkerchief and nods his head to the orchestra leader. The orchestra leader acknowledges the signal by nodding his head\u0097turns to his men\u0097waves his baton, and the orchestra starts playing, \"Here Comes the Bride.\"\u0097The guests whisper to each other excitedly. A great deal of stirring takes place. The door of the house slowly opens\u0097and a parade of small flower girls emerges. They march, taking each step carefully, while they strew flowers along the path. They are well out of the way when Ellie, on the arm of her father, appears in the doorway. A view of the guests shows that they cannot contain themselves. Murmurs of \"Here she comes,\" and \"Doesn't she look beautiful?\" are heard. The newsreel men on their platform behind the altar bestir themselves. This is what they've been waiting for! ELLIE and her FATHER  now make their way to the altar. Ellie's face is solemn, and her jaws set. ", "ANDREWS": "\n[1]On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last? \n[2]Been sending her meals in regularly? \n[3]Why didn't you jam it down her throat? \n[4]Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself. He leaves with determination, followed by the Captain, and both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin, Andrews grim. \n[5]What's this! What's happened here? \n[6]Get another tray ready. Bring it here at once.  Open the door. The Guard unlocks the door and Andrews enters. Then we get a view of the CABIN at the door, as Andrews enters and closes the door behind him. He looks around and his eyes light on his prisoner, following which the view swings over to ELLIE, a beautiful girl in her early twenties. At the moment, she holds a small vase over her head ready to heave it, and her eyes flash angrily. At sight of her new visitor, however, she lowers the vase and sets it on a small table. ? 210 ? \n[7]What's this about not eating? \n[8]Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes. \n[9]I might. \n[10]Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way. \n[11]You ought to know why. Because\u0097 \n[12]Because marrying that fool King Westley is\u0097 ? 211 ? \n[13]Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not. (they are interrupted by a knock at the door \n[14]Yes? The door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of steaming food. \n[15]Wait a minute! Don't get excited! This isn't for you.  Put it right here. Ellie glares at her father, and wanders over to the window seat, while the waiters occupy themselves setting the table. Andrews putters around the food, lifting the lids from which tempting aromas emanate. He shuts his eyes, murmuring \"oohs\" and \"ahs.\" A close-up of ELLIE shows her, too, drinking in the inviting aromas; and for a moment she weakens. A close view of ANDREWS shows him glancing toward Ellie to see her reaction; whereupon Ellie's face freezes. Then Andrews and the waiters come into view. \n[16]No. Everything seems quite satisfactory. I may want some more of that delicious gravy. I'll ring. \n[17]Heavenly! Now Ellie appears in the foreground, with Andrews at the table in the background. \n[18]If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India. \n[19]Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said. \n[20]South America. \n[21]We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard. \n[22]In that event, we won't need so many supplies. ? 213 ? \n[23]I'll get it annulled. \n[24]I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it\u0097if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm\u0097mmm. This filet mignon is divine! \n[25]Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all. \n[26]That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup? \n[27]Never mind\u0097I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks. \n[28]You're going to finance him, I suppose. \n[29]He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to. \n[30]You'll be set free when the marriage is annulled. A close-up of ELLIE, her eyes blazing angrily, shows her slowly edging away from her father, while he continues. \n[31]A time will come when you'll thank me for this. \n[32]Please don't shout. \n[33]Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it. He is about to insert the first bite in his mouth when Ellie, her temper vanishing completely, overturns the small serving table, dumping its contents into her father's lap. The movement is so unexpected that Andrews, the fork still suspended near his mouth, stares at her stupefied. Then realizing what she has done, his eyes flash in anger. Dropping his fork, he rises and goes over to her, while she stands facing him defiantly. Without a word or warning, he slaps her a stinging blow across the cheek. For a moment she doesn't stir, her eyes widening in surprise, and staring at him unbelievingly. Then turning abruptly she bolts out of the door. Andrews remains motionless, his eyes shutting painfully; it is the first time he has struck her, and it hurts. \n[34]Ellie!  Next on the DECK, at the open cabin door, Andrews is seen, staring off at something and an amazed, frightened look comes into his eyes. Then, as viewed from his position at the cabin door, Ellie appears standing on the rail; and with a professional dive, she leaps into the water. A full view of the DECK reveals the crew and the officers scurrying around, several of them shouting: \"Somebody overboard!\" \n[35]It's my daughter! Go after her. \n[36]Of course she got away\u0097too smart for you. \n[37]Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money. \n[38]Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, \"Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads\u0097all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!\" \n[39]Any others? \n[40]What do they say? \n[41]Amateurs! \n[42]I thought I made it clear I was in a hurry to get to New York?  What are we crawling for! In the control cockpit, the pilot reacts to the complaint and glances at his speed indicator. We then see the SPEED INDICATOR registering 180 miles an hour. The pilot looks aghast. \n[43]Well, step on it! Step on it! He bangs up the receiver and stares moodily out of the window. It is plain that he is worried. The view then includes his secretary, Henderson. \n[44]Of course she's all right. What do you think can happen! \n[45]Then shut up about it! Thereupon the view cuts to a close-up of an airplane motor in rapid motion, and this dissolves to the AUTO CAMP CABIN next morning, a close view showing ELLIE peacefully sleeping. But the drone of the plane overhead disturbs her, and she moves restlessly. \n[46]Three days! Three whole days! And what have you accomplished!\u0097  All you've shown me is a stack of feeble reports from those comical detectives of yours. I want action, Lovington! \n[47]What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found! \n[48]It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley? \n[49]I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her. (he is interrupted by the entrance of several employees \n[50]Oh, Clark\u0097want you to arrange for a radio broadcast\u0097right away\u0097coast to coast hook-up! Offer a reward of ten thousand dollars for any information leading to her whereabouts. \n[51]Brown\u0097 \n[52]Send the story out to the newspapers. (he rips a picture of Ellie on the desk out of its frame Some of the out of town papers may not have a picture of her. Here\u0097wire this to them\u0097I want it to break right away. As he hands the picture to Brown, the view moves in to a close-up of the PICTURE which dissolves to a close-up of the same picture in a newspaper, and as the view draws slowly back we see the headline over it, which reads \n[53]I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it? \n[54]You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy. \n[55]Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me. ? 288 ? \n[56]All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement\u0097that you've had a talk with me\u0097that we've reached an understanding\u0097that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that? \n[57]Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to\u0097  \u0097as long as I can get her back.  As Andrews opens the door, a number of reporters enter. \n[58]Come in, boys. This is my\u0097uh\u0097this is King Westley.  He has a statement to make. \n[59]Can't you get them to go any faster? (at this the Inspector leans over to talk to chauffeur This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing. \n[60]Later, boys, later. See her at home. They cross the sidewalk\u0097to the waiting limousine, as cameras click. The scene dissolves to a ROAD, with Peter still driving. He is, however, as before, in excellent form, and is singing lustily. Suddenly, however, his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake; the car screeches and moans\u0097and comes to a stop. \n[61]Well, here we are; it's all set. You're finally going to be married properly.  With all the fanfare and everything. ? 307 ?  I still don't know how it happened\u0097but you're going to be my son-in-law whether I like it or not. I guess you're pleased. \n[62]Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world. \n[63]Someday perhaps, you might even take charge. A close view of ANDREWS shows him looking around his study despairingly. \n[64]The thought of it makes me shudder. \n[65]I hope so. However, that'll take care of itself.  There's another responsibility you're taking on. One that I'm really concerned about. \n[66]My daughter. \n[67]No? Say, listen\u0097I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers\u0097some of the most powerful people in the world\u0097but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy. ? 308 ?  Now listen\u0097if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell. \n[68]Sock her! A close view of KING shows him looking up, surprised, as Andrews' voice continues. \n[69]Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me\u0097and maybe we'll be friends\u0097  Maybe.  Do we understand each other? \n[70]Fine. I'll see you at the reception. He withdraws his hand, which he looks at disgustedly\u0097the result of a jellyfish handshake. \n[71]You thought that up all by yourself, huh? \n[72]Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object. \n[73]We've done that already. \n[74]Autogyro! I hope he breaks his leg. Andrews starts out, and the scene cuts to the HALLWAY as Andrews enters from the study. A maid coming down the stairs, he calls to her: \n[75]Oh\u0097Mary\u0097 \n[76]How is she? \n[77]What's the matter? Anything wrong? \n[78]Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? \n[79]Ellie\u0097 \n[80]I knocked several times. \n[81]Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull. \n[82]Landing on the lawn in an autogyro. \n[83]Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too. As he continues talking, the view moves with Ellie, who wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares out, lost in thought. \n[84]What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong? \n[85]You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm\u0097I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions\u0097I\u0097  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you? \n[86]If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare\u0097I\u0097when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be. \n[87]Ellie\u0097what is it? Aren't you happy, child? At this point she finally breaks, and impulsively buries her face on his breast. \n[88]I thought so. I knew there was something on your mind.  There\u0097there! They remain thus quietly for some time. Finally Andrews breaks the silence. \n[89]What is it, darling?  You haven't fallen in love with somebody else, have you? As this brings an audible sob from Ellie, Andrews lifts up her chin. ? 312 ? \n[90]Have you? (Ellie turns her head away, a little ashamed of her tears Ellie now rises and walks miserably away from him, dabbing her eyes. Andrews, watching her, realizes he has hit upon the truth. He walks over to her. \n[91]I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him? \n[92]Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver! \n[93]Who is he? \n[94]Well, if it's as serious as all that\u0097we'll move heaven and earth to\u0097 \n[95]Oh, come now\u0097 \n[96]Ridiculous! \n[97]Well! \n[98]Fine man to fall in love with. \n[99]Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he? \n[100]I'd like to have a talk with him. \n[101]Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off? \n[102]But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why\u0097 \n[103]You've changed, Ellie. ? 314 ? \n[104]Is that his name? \n[105]Peter Warne! (his hand has instinctively gone to his inside pocket \n[106]Oh, no\u0097no. \n[107]Why, no . . . Don't be silly. \n[108]I'm sorry you read it. \n[109]I suppose so. \n[110]I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters. \n[111]I leave for Washington tonight. May be gone several weeks. Thought perhaps you'd like to get this thing settled. This cuts to the HOTEL ROOM where PETER is at the phone. \n[112]You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if\u0097 \n[113]Show him in. The Butler leaving, a close view shows ANDREWS reaching over and snapping on a dictograph concealed somewhere on his desk. The office coming into view again, we see Andrews rising and awaiting Peter's entrance. After a moment Peter comes in, removes his soft felt hat, and tucks it under his arm. \n[114]Mr. Warne? \n[115]Come in. Sit down. Peter advances into the room, looking around curiously. His air is frigid, contemptuous as Andrews studies him, and he makes no move to sit. Andrews waves to a chair and sits down himself. Peter flops into the nearest chair. \n[116]I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her. \n[117]Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get. \n[118]I don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in\u0097 \n[119]And this is what you want\u0097thirty-nine dollars and sixty cents? \n[120]Yes, I know\u0097but\u0097 \n[121]Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars? \n[122]The reward. \n[123]I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for\u0097 \n[124]You're a peculiar chap. ? 320 ? \n[125]The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to\u0097 \n[126]You were taken for a buggy ride? \n[127]Certainly. (he opens a checkbook and writes it out While Andrews writes, Peter wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt. Andrews rises and goes to him. \n[128]Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter? \n[129]That's an evasion. \n[130]Do you love her? \n[131]I asked you a question. Do you love her? \n[132]I just had a long talk with him. \n[133]Now, wait a minute, Ellie\u0097 \n[134]You're a sucker to go through with this. Ellie glances at him out of the corner of her eye\u0097and quickly turns forward again. ? 323 ? \n[135]That guy Warne is O.K. He didn't want the reward. Ellie keeps her eyes glued in front of her, remaining expressionless. \n[136]All he asked for was thirty-nine dollars and sixty cents . . . that's what he spent on you. It was a matter of principle with him\u0097says you took him for a ride. This registers on Ellie and she raises her eyes\u0097but her reaction is only slightly perceptible. A close view of a GROUP OF GUESTS shows two girls looking enviously in the direction of the bride. \n[137]He loves you, Ellie. Told me so. This brings a definite reaction, which she quickly covers up. \n[138]You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley. At this there is a close view of Westley\u0097there is a satisfied smirk on his face. \n[139]I can buy him off for a pot of gold, and you can make an old man happy, and you wouldn't do so bad for yourself. If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate. Ellie gives no indication of her intentions. Her face remains immobile. And now Ellie and her father have reached the altar. The \"prissy\" man is placing them in position. The big moment has arrived. The guests are all atwitter. But a close view of ELLIE shows that she realizes that her fate is closing in on her. She looks around for a means of escape. \n[140]I haven't the slightest idea. But his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling. As King runs out of sight Andrews gets out a cigar and lights it\u0097a happy smile on his face which he now doesn't try to conceal. Outside the FRONT GATE Ellie is seen in a fast roadster, as she starts away with a plunge. Her eyes sparkle. A crowd of people dash up, headed by King. They stop dead when they see the car disappear. On the LAWN the commotion runs high, and the guests chatter their amazement. A close view of ANDREWS shows him smiling with satisfaction. The scene dissolves to ANDREWS' OFFICE, where Andrews is regaling himself with a whiskey and soda. He is in a pleasantly inebriated mood when his SECRETARY enters. ? 325 ? \n[141]Don't want to talk to\u0097don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody. \n[142]Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows. \n[143]\"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling.\"  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: \"Let 'em topple.\" This dissolves to the exterior of an AUTO CAMP very much like the other camps at which Peter and Ellie stayed. The owner's wife is talking to her husband. ", "SHAPELEY": "\n[1]You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. (he pulls out a cigar, and continues\u0097awed by the recollection Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. (he lights his cigar, takes a vigorous puff, and turns to her again What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. \n[2]That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth! A close-up shows ELLIE enduring more of this as Shapeley's voice continues: \n[3]Take this last town I was in. I run into a dame\u0097not a bad looker, either\u0097but boy, was she an iceberg! Every time I opened my kisser she pulls a ten strike on me. It sure looked like cold turkey for old man Shapeley. I sell office supplies, see? And this hotsy-totsy lays the damper on me quick. She don't need a thing\u0097and if she did she wouldn't buy it from a fresh mugg like me. Well, says I to myself\u0097Shapeley, you better go to work. You're up against a lulu. Well, I'm here to tell you, sister, I opened up a line of fast chatter that had that dame spinnin' like a Russian dancer. Before I got through she bought enough stuff to last the firm a year. And did she put on an act when I blew town! Ellie has scarcely listened to him, and has divided her attention between glancing back at Peter and staring at Shapeley as if he were insane\u0097none of which bothers Shapeley. He goes on with his merry chatter, blowing rings of smoke in the direction of the ceiling. \n[4]Yessir. When a cold mama gets hot\u0097boy, how she sizzles! She kinda cramped my style, though. I didn't look at a dame for three towns.  Not that I couldn't. For me it's always a cinch. I got a much better chance than the local talent.  You see, they're kinda leery about the local talent. Too close to home. Know what I mean? ELLIE has now reached the point where she could, without any compunction, strangle him. \n[5]But I don't go in for that kinda stuff\u0097much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. \"Fun-on-the-side Shapeley\" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.  \n[6]Well, you're two up on me now.  \n[7]Huh? \n[8]What's the idea? \n[9]Wife? \n[10]Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'\u0097you know\u0097to make things pleasant. And smiling sheepishly, he sidles over to Peter's seat, his two fingers still poised in air. Peter plants himself next to Ellie and totally ignoring her, opens his magazine, and resumes his reading. Then Ellie and Peter are seen close together. She looks up at him. \n[11]Hello, sister. Ellie ignores him, and walks toward her cabin. But Shapeley falls into step with her. \n[12]Sorry about last night. Didn't know you were married to that guy. Shoulda told me about it right off.  There I was, gettin' myself all primed for a killin', and you turn out to be an old married woman. The scene cuts to the door of PETER'S CABIN as Peter comes out, stands in the doorway, and is surprised to see Ellie and Shapeley, who are then seen talking. Thereupon PETER is seen again as his lip curls up a little jealously; he returns to the cabin, following which we again see Ellie and Shapeley walking. He notices the robe she is wearing, and he looks down toward her feet, the view moving down to show Ellie's legs and feet. The pajama legs are seen protruding below the robe, the cuffs of which she has turned up. Then the view moving back up to Ellie and Shapeley, he lifts her robe playfully. ? 251 ? \n[13]Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir. \n[14]Sorry\u0097I didn't mean to\u0097 \n[15]Okay. I was just trying to make conversation. Ellie leaves him abruptly, and the scene cuts to the CABIN, where Peter is now busy setting the small table. Ellie enters after a moment, while Peter has his back to the door. \n[16]What's up? ? 266 ? \n[17]Say, Buddy\u0096 Peter turns, and looks at him quizzically, and the two are then seen close together. \n[18]Like to have a look at my paper? He has taken it out and has it opened as he hands it to Peter. The headlines concerning Ellie and her picture shriek out at Peter. This startles him for a moment, but he manages to recover his poise. \n[19]Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world. \n[20]If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say. \n[21]Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers. \n[22]It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do? \n[23]I'd go fifty-fifty with you . \n[24]Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say. \n[25]Five G's\u0097or I crab the works. \n[26]You're not making any mistake, believe you me. \n[27]Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to\u0097 \n[28]Huh? \n[29]Why\u0097no\u0097 \n[30]The Killer? \n[31]You're not kidnapping her, are you? \n[32]Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see\u0097and\u0097 \n[33]But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with\u0097 \n[34]I won't say anything. Honest, I won't. ? 269 ? \n[35]You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut. \n[36]Oscar Shapeley. \n[37]Orange, New Jersey. \n[38]Yeah. Just babies. \n[39]Oh, gee, Mister\u0097you wouldn't\u0097you ain't thinkin' about\u0097 \n[40]Sure\u0097sure\u0097I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister. \n[41]No. \n[42]Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids. \n[43]Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted. \n[44]Sure. Anything you say. As he says this, he backs away from Peter, following which a close-up of PETER shows a twinkle in his eye and then, as seen by Peter, Shapeley appears walking hurriedly away. When he thinks the distance is safe he starts running. He slips and falls in the mud, picks himself up, and continues his race for life. The scene dissolves to the ROAD, at night, with Ellie and Peter walking along. It is apparent they have been trudging like this for a long time. ", "GORDON": "\n[1]Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department. \n[2]Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more. ? 219 ? \n[3]When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.  \n[4]Huh? \n[5]What!  Say, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office\u0097unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. (he bangs down the receiver viciously and glowers at the phone In the PHONE BOOTH Peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him. But he goes right on for the benefit of the boys. \n[6]Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  \"Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same.\" Gordon snatches the wire out of her hand and tears it viciously into bits. \n[7]Collect? \n[8]Don't accept any more. The scene dissolves to ANDREWS' NEW YORK OFFICE\u0097a richly appointed place, awe-inspiring in its dignified furnishings, which shriek of wealth. Andrews paces back and forth in back of his desk. Sitting before him is a man of fifty, with very rugged features. He is Lovington, head of the detective agency bearing his name. When the scene opens, Andrews is holding forth: \n[9]Get out of here! \n[10]Get out! Peter reaches his side, and grabs him by the arms. \n[11]Don't \"Joe\" me. ? 296 ? \n[12]You mean about the Andrews' kid? \n[13]A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily. \n[14]What's the thousand bucks for? \n[15]What! \n[16]Huh? \n[17]You're drunk. \n[18]If it's on the level. \n[19]Who's she gonna marry? \n[20]I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk. \n[21]I'd put you there myself. \n[22]Who's the guy she's gonna marry? \n[23]You! \n[24]Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more. \n[25]Well, I'll be\u0097 ? 298 ? \n[26]What a story!  On her way to join her husband, Ellen Andrews falls in love with\u0097 (alert\u0097grabbing paper out of Peter's hand Lemme see that a minute. He moves to his desk excitedly, and Peter, a gleam of hope in his eyes, joins him, following which the scene cuts to the SHACK of the camp owner and wife in the early morning. The owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice of his wife calling, \"zeke! zeke!\" He looks up, just as she rushes into the room. \n[27]Okay, pete. (he drops the story on the desk and escorts peter out, his arm around his shoulder For my dough,  you're still the best newspaperman in the business. They reach the door, which peter opens. Then they appear at the DOORWAY. Through the open door the secretary stares dumbfounded at their friendliness. \n[28]S'long, kid. And good luck. Outside GORDON'S OFFICE, peter kisses the secretary as he passes through. \n[29]Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition. While he speaks he dashes back to his desk. We then see him in his office. \n[30]Hank! Listen. Hold the morning edition. Break down the front page. Gonna have a completely new layout\u0097Send a couple of re-write men in here. Don't do a thing\u0097I got a story that'll make your hair curl. During his speech, his other phone has been ringing persistently. He has ignored it until now. He picks up receiver: \n[31]Yeah. Yeah. Don't annoy me. I'm busy. (he bangs up receiver, and turns back to the first phone Listen, Hank! Dig out all the Andrews pictures. Get Healy out of bed. I want a cartoon right away. (the second phone rings impatiently, but Gordon ignores it With King Westley in it. He's waiting at the church. Big tears streaming down his face. His bride hasn't shown up. Old Man Andrews is there, ? 302 ? too. Laughing his head off. Everything exaggerated. You know\u0097Now snap into it! (he bangs up the receiver, and grabs the second phone, speaking into it impatiently Yeah. Yeah. What is it? A close view of GORDON, as he listens, shows his eyes widening with amazement. \n[32]What!\u0097Ellen Andrews! You're crazy! This cuts to a TELEPHONE BOOTH where a reporter is seen speaking excitedly. \n[33]You sure that's right! Say, you haven't been drinking, have you! Okay\u0097grab a car\u0097and stay with them. (he hangs up the receiver and grabs the first phone Put Hank on.  Agnes!  Get me a doctor. I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. (she stares at him dumbly as he speaks into the phone Hank\u0097forget everything I just told you. I was just having a nightmare!  Call up the police department! Tell 'em to find Peter Warne. Send out a general alarm. I want the dirty crook pinched. He picks up Peter's story and flings it viciously into the wastebasket. \n[34]Yeah. Shove everything off the front page. Ellen Andrews just phoned her father\u0097she's coming home. The moment she heard the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up. Spread it all over the place. Here's your lead: \"Love Triumphant!\" Step on it! ? 303 ? \n[35]You can't get a thing done around her unless\u0097 \n[36]Huh? What? \n[37]Where is he? The scene cuts to the OUTER OFFICE and CORRIDOR, as seen over Gordon's shoulder through the open door. Peter is seen walking out. Gordon hurries after him. \n[38]Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while. \n[39]Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn\u0097then something comes along\u0097messes up the finish\u0097and there you are. \n[40]When you sober up\u0097come in and see me. ", "WIFE": "\n[1]There you go\u0097trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you\u0097 \n[2]Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you. \n[3]Mebbe. \n[4]I don't trust him. The scene cuts to the inside of a CABIN not unlike the previous auto camp cabin in which Peter and Ellie spent a night. Peter's opened suitcase is on a chair, over which he leans. Ellie walks around, puffing at a cigarette. ? 290 ? \n[5]I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone! \n[6]That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it. Thereupon the scene cuts to the AUTO CAMP CABIN affording a close view of ELLIE tossing restlessly in her sleep. Suddenly there is a loud banging on the door, and Ellie, startled, awakens. The pounding continuing, Ellie looks around, frightened. The door suddenly bursts open, and the owner and wife enter. They both glance over at Peter's side. \n[7]See that. They're gone! \n[8]Oh!! ? 299 ? \n[9]Where's your husband, young lady\u0097 \n[10]Yes\u0097if he is your husband. \n[11]No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too. \n[12]Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything. (Ellie is perceptibly startled by this piece of news Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . . There is a close view of ELLIE as the wife's voice continues uninterruptedly: \n[13]Then\u0097you'll have to git ! \n[14]Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp. \n[15]Ain't gonna wait a minute. \n[16]Better start gettin' into your clothes. \n[17]Zeke.  Git! \n[18]You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office. The scene thereupon cuts to the EXTERIOR of the AUTO CABIN as Ellie emerges, the Wife standing in the doorway. In the foreground several people are scattered around the courtyard. One woman washes stockings under a pump. A man is changing the tire on his car. Ellie comes down the steps and crosses the courtyard. \n[19]And listen, next time better keep away from here. I run a respectable place. Ellie does not turn, but walks straight forward, trying to maintain her poise. The people in the courtyard turn to stare at her, and one of them snickers. The scene dissolves to GORDON'S OFFICE as Peter is pocketing the money. Gordon is fondling the story. \n[20]Funny couple, ain't they? \n[21]If you ask me, I don't believe they're married. \n[22]They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this. \n[23]What do you reckon that's for? \n[24]A trumpet? \n[25]But what in the world do they want a trumpet for? ", "PETER'S VOICE": "\n[1]I'm not going to stand for this any longer. In a pig's eye, you will!\u0097 \n[2]Well, Brat\u0097what do you say! ? 240 ? As she doesn't stir, there appears a close-up view of PETER standing in the doorway of the cabin, looking toward Ellie. \n[3]Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me. \n[4]I once knew a chap who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed.  Made a comical picture . . . As the scene includes both of them, Peter spreads his shirt over his coat. \n[5]I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you? \n[6]One\u0097two\u0097three\u0097four\u0097five \n[7]\u0097six\u0097seven\u0097eight\u0097nine\u0097 \n[8]Come here, you little fool! She starts toward him. We then see him plunking her in a chair: \n[9]She says she saw your sister Ethel the other day, and she's looking swell. The detective knocks on the door. At this we again see inside of the cabin as Peter whispers to Ellie to say \"Come in.\" \n[10]I hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don't you? She's always wanted a boy. I think we'll stop over in Wilkes-Barre this trip, darling. Give the family a treat. A close view shows Ellie and the detective. They have been staring at each other. \n[11]Who\u0097me? (appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly Want to see me? \n[12]Oh, no! I saw him! He kept pawing you all over the dance floor! \n[13]If you come through all right, your five G's are in the bag. Maybe more. I'll talk to the \"Killer\"\u0097see that he takes care of you. \n[14]You can't be hungry and scared at the same time. \n[15]Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want. \n[16]I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed\u0097  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired\u0097and it's the only thing around. \n[17]All right, Brat. At the sound of his voice, she is startled, and she quickly folds the paper and throws it out of sight. She starts to get out of the car. \n[18]Yep! The Walls of Jericho.  PETER  stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side. \n[19]Not interested. (at this Ellie's face falls, this is a definite rebuff \n[20]Certainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things\u0097 PETER  has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward. ", "DRIVER": "\n[1]Whadda you want! \n[2]Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. (with which remark the driver turns away from him \n[3]Hey, wait a minute! ? 222 ? Peter, his arms holding the suitcase over his head, turns and glances at the driver, a quizzical look in his eyes. \n[4]What do you think you're doing! \n[5]The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out! \n[6]Hey, whadda you tryin' to do\u0097kid me? \n[7]What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up. \n[8]Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose. \n[9]Oh, yeah? \n[10]Oh, yeah? \n[11]No. First come, first served. \n[12]Yeah? ? 224 ? \n[13]Maybe they do\u0097and maybe they don't. Peter lifts Ellie's overnight bag off the seat and drops it on the floor. Part of her coat covers the small space by her side. This he sweeps across her lap. \n[14]Rest station! Ten minutes! The view draws back as some of the passengers rise. The men stretch their legs, and the women straighten out their skirts. A close view of Peter and Ellie then shows her rising. Peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass, and Ellie starts up the aisle. But she suddenly stops; looks back, first at her bag and then at Peter; decides to take her bag with her, and returns to take it. She reaches for it on the rack, Peter watching her, amused. The scene dissolves to the outside of the REST STATION with several passengers walking briskly back and forth. The place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, and Peter can be seen leaning against one of these posts, smoking a cigarette. The scene moving in, a close view of Peter shows him stealing a glance in the direction of Ellie. And a view, from his angle, reveals Ellie in the shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. She slowly turns her head toward Peter and then quickly averts it. PETER  speculates about her. He glances around the place, and the scene moves about, following his gaze. It takes in the other passengers, all obviously poor and uncultured. The moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter reacting with comprehension: No doubt about it! She doesn't belong with these passengers. Then suddenly he sees something which startles him, and we see what it is: Directly in back of her, the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight bag from the ground and starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious of his actions. PETER springs forward. Ellie sees Peter coming toward her and is perceptibly startled. But Peter whizzes by her, and this amazes her even more. She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, and resumes her smoking. In a few seconds Peter returns, puffing breathlessly. \n[15]Oh, yeah? ELLIE stirs, squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shifts her position. Just as she settles down, her eyes open. She stares out of the window with unseeing eyes, and then closes them ? 228 ? dreamily, giving the impression that, still half conscious, she is trying to recall where she is. Apparently she does, for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head. Finally (in a scene including Peter), Ellie realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder, whereupon she straightens up, embarrassed. \n[16]About a half hour. \n[17]Looks like we can't go through till morning. \n[18]That storm sure made a mess outa these roads. \n[19]Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here. Shapeley is just entering the outskirts of the group. He stops, looks in the direction of Peter speculatively. He has the newspaper stuck in his pocket, which he caresses tenderly. The scene expanding, Peter is then seen leaving the group. ", "KING": "\n[1]You've made that quite evident\u0097with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment. \n[2]Why; naturally, I\u0097 \n[3]You talk as if\u0097 \n[4]Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility. \n[5]What would you like to have me do? \n[6]It's quite an assignment\u0097 \n[7]Yes, sir. \n[8]Oh, by the way, Mr Andrews, I thought of a great stunt for the reception.  I'm going to land on the lawn in an autogyro.[14] What do you think of that! A close view of ANDREWS shows him staring off at King in complete disgust. \n[9]Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that\u0097 ? 309 ? \n[10]Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.  \n[11]Yes, of course. He turns and leaves; Andrews watching him go, shaking his head sadly. \n[12]How are you, Ellie? (he gives her a kiss, which she accepts perfunctorily\u0097but he insists upon being ardent Are you happy? \n[13]You bet we did. \n[14]Whatever you say, darling. \n[15]I will. \n[16]Ellie! He starts to go after her\u0097but finds Andrews in his way while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus. \n[17]What happened? ", "BOY": "\n[1]Here you are, folks. Candy\u0097popcorn\u0097cigarettes\u0097magazines\u0097 As Ellie and Peter are seen again, she turns and calls to the boy: \n[2]Yes, ma'am? \n[3]But the lady says\u0097 \n[4]What'sa matter, Ma? Don't you feel all right? The woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure. She presses her son's small hand in a feeble effort at assurance. A close view of Ellie and Peter shows ELLIE singing more boisterously than the rest, doing the comical song with exaggerated gestures. But suddenly her face clouds, at something she sees. \n[5]Ma! Ma! What'sa matter with you?  Somebody help me! Somethin's happened to her! The music stops abruptly. Everyone looks up, startled. Ellie starts forward, followed by Peter. Passengers closely group around the woman and chatter. \"She's fainted. Look how pale she is.\" Peter and Ellie step up. \n[6]Ma\u0097oh, gee, Ma\u0097! ? 264 ? His mother clings to him, but still feeling faint, her head sways. Peter looks up at Ellie and gives her a sign to sit down beside the woman. ELLIE sits down beside her. Peter takes the boy by the shoulders. \n[7]We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday. \n[8]Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York\u0097and if we didn't go, she might lose it. \n[9]I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess. Peter reaches into his pocket for a bill, just as Ellie approaches them. \n[10]I shouldn't oughta take this. Ma'll be angry. \n[11]No-o. But I shouldn't oughta take the money.  You might need it. \n[12]Thanks. ", "SECRETARY": "\n[1]Mr. Gordon\u0097 \n[2]Did you know he reversed the charges on that call? \n[3]Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  \"Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible.\" Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston. \n[4]Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them? \n[5]They're practically all the same, sir. (he shrugs his shoulders to indicate there is no news \n[6]They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir. ? 247 ? Andrews doesn't answer him. He puffs furiously on his cigar, glances out of the window, and turns irritably to a phone by his side. He snaps up the receiver and presses a button, following which the scene cuts to the CONTROL COCKPIT, where a light flashes on the instrument board, and the pilot picks up the receiver. \n[7]Here's another wire from Peter Warne. \n[8]Yes. \n[9]But it's King Westley on the phone. \n[10]There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan. ", "MAN": "\n[1]Hey, Galli-Curci,[9] come on\u0097get onto it!  You, too, McCormack. Ellie and Peter snap into it; they are just in time for the long wail which precedes the chorus: \n[2]Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas. \n[3]I ain't got a hat\u0097 \n[4]I ain't got a hat. \n[5]Yeah. \n[6]They're married all right. I just seen the license. \n[7]Yeah? ? 326 ? \n[8]Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet. \n[9]Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it. \n[10]I dunno. The scene moves to the cabin occupied presumably by Peter and Ellie. The windows are lighted. There is a blast from a trumpet, and as the lights go out a blanket is seen dropping to the floor, and the scene fades out. ", "OWNER": "\n[1]He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma. \n[2]Said he was gonna stay a week. \n[3]Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security. \n[4]Who? \n[5]Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma. \n[6]Yeah, you'll have to git . \n[7]Not a minute! \n[8]Yeah. \n[9]Yes, Ma. As Zeke leaves, the Wife plunks herself in a chair, grimly determined to wait until Ellie gets dressed and out. ", "CAPTAIN": "\n[1]She hasn't had a thing yesterday\u0097or today. \n[2]Yessir. She refuses them all. \n[3]It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one\u0097 \n[4]This is dangerous business, Mr. Andrews. After all, kidnapping is no child's play. But Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward. They arrive in front of the cabin door, where Lacey is brushing himself off, and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes. \n[5]Lower the boats! General excitement reigns; several of the crew dive into the water; others release the boat lines. Following this Ellie is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves. Next she appears as a small speck in the distance, while half a dozen of the crew are swimming in pursuit. At the SIDE OF THE YACHT one of the boats has already been lowered, and two men jump in and grab the oars. The men seem to be gaining on Ellie. In the distance several small motor boats are anchored, and over the sides of the boats their owners are fishing. Ellie seems to be headed in their direction. One of the motor boats appears closer. A middle-aged man sits on the stern, holding lazily to his line, his feet dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the turbulent waves. ELLIE is then again seen swimming. She looks back, and the next scene shows the men rowing toward her, and gaining on her. Thereupon we see Ellie ducking under the water. ? 216 ? The middle-aged fisherman is suddenly startled by Ellie's face which appears from under water, right between his legs. Ellie puts her finger up to her lips, warning him to shush, and he is too dumb-founded to say anything. As the pursuing boats come near, Ellie ducks under the water again and the boats scoot right by the fisherman. Then Ellie's head bobs up; she peers ahead of her, and seeing that her pursuers have passed her, she smiles victoriously. \n[6]What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible! \n[7]What about that diamond wrist watch she had on\u0097she can raise some money on that? \n[8]I want everything to be just so. When the ceremony starts, you stand on the side\u0097still . No moving around\u0097no talking, comprenez ? The view cuts to a ROADWAY leading to the estate, and Peter is seen driving up in his Ford and squeezing in between two Rolls-Royces. The uniformed chauffeurs glare at him. But Peter springs nonchalantly out of his car. ", "ELLIE'S VOICE": "\n[1]You'll have to wait for me. \n[2]Oh, excuse me. (and we see the underthings flipped off the blanket. Ellie's side of the room appears, showing her crawling quickly into bed, pulling the covers over her and glancing apprehensively in Peter's direction\u0097following which a close view shows PETER being very conscious of her proximity. The situation is delicate and dangerous; the room is atingle with sex. He turns his gaze toward the blanket. The view moves to the BLANKET, remaining on it a moment. It is a frail barrier. The view then moves back to Peter, whose eyes are still on the blanket, his face expressionless. A close view of ELLIE, next shows that she, too, has her eyes glued on the blanket, a little fearfully. She turns her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment. Then suddenly her eyes widen\u0097and she sits up abruptly. \n[3]Yes? \n[4]What time is it? \n[5]We must come back to this place often. You meet the nicest people! Her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she dresses. \n[6]He didn't! You were drunk! \n[7]I'm hungry. \n[8]I've got to settle down. It really doesn't matter how\u0097or where\u0097or with whom. ", "DANKER": "\n[1]So you've just been married, huh? Well, that's pretty good. If I was young, that's just the way I'd spend my honeymoon\u0097hitch-hiking. Y-e-s s-i-r! And for no reason except that he cued himself into it, he bursts forth into song gustily. \n[2]\"Hiking down the highway of love on a honeymoon. Hitch-hiking down\u0097 Down-down-down the highway Down\u0097.\" Ellie and Peter in the back of the car react to the noise Danker makes. \n[3]Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  \"My tonsils won't burn\u0097 As life's corners I . . . \n[4]. . . turn.\" \n[5]How about a bite to eat? ? 285 ? \n[6]Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry. \n[7]\"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . .\" When he is out of sight, Peter glares at Ellie. ", "GUARD": "\n[1]Who's gonna take it in to her? You? \n[2]Come on! Make up your mind! A petty officer approaches. He is blustering and officious, but the type that is feeble and ineffective. His name is Lacey. \n[3]Left twenty minutes ago. \n[4]Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the view then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie. \n[5]Eight o'clock tonight. \n[6]Sorry, Miss. The Guard leaves the scene, and Ellie's disappointment is apparent. ", "LACEY": "\n[1]What's up? What's up? There is a fairly close picture of the GROUP featuring Lacey and the Steward. \n[2]That's ridiculous! Afraid of a mere girl!  Why didn't you do it yourself? \n[3]I never heard of such a thing! Afraid of a mere girl.  I'll take it in myself. They all stand around and watch him, much relieved. He picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin. \n[4]Can't get a thing done unless you do it yourself.  Open the door. We see him at the CABIN DOOR as the guard quickly and gingerly unlocks it. \n[5]Afraid of a mere girl! Ridiculous. Lacey stalks in bravely, the tray held majestically in front of him, while the steward and waiters form a circle around the door, waiting expectantly. There is a short pause, following which Lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands on his back, the tray of food scattering all over him. The steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the waiters stare silently. The scene dissolves to the MAIN DECK of the yacht, first affording a close view of a pair of well-shod masculine feet, as they pace agitatedly back and forth. Then as the scene draws back, the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered to be Alexander Andrews, immaculately groomed in yachting clothes. In front of him stands a uniformed Captain, but Andrews, brows wrinkled, deep in thought, continues his pacing. ? 209 ? \n[6]She refused another meal, sir. "}}
