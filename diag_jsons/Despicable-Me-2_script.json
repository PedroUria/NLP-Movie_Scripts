I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies. \n[33]Oh, attitude! That's right! So thanks, but no thanks. And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt! \n[34]Oh, yeah, like that's any better! \n[35]Hey, I told you guys to get to bed. \n[36]What? \n[37]Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.

And we are closed. \n[82]Look away! \n[83]El Macho. \n[84]But it couldn't be... \n[85]That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago. \n[86]He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho. \n[87]He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands. \n[88]Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon. \n[89]He died in the most macho way possible. \n[90]Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano. \n[91]It was glorious. \n[92]They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair. But... that face. It has got to be El Macho. \n[93]Yes, that's good, because I'm telling you--if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum... \n[94]...it's him. \n[95]Alright, alright, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed. \n[96]I just... I have a lot of work to do. \n[97]Very important business. So...hugs, kisses... ...good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah- blah-- \n[98]Fine, fine... Let me hear it. Quickly. \n[99]Wow! That was...something else. I really liked the way you smiled at the end. Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay? \n[100]Perfect!   Time to go! \n[101]Well, what do you mean?    Why not? \n[102]Well, you don't need one to do the show. I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat. \n[103]Okay, well, then...maybe you can just use your imagination. \n[104]Yes, right. You can do that, can't you? \n[105]Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no! Hey, please! \n[106]Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay? Dave, Stuart--come this way. With me! Come on! \n[107]We're stealth ninjas.    We make no sound. \n[108]Alright, El Macho, you're going down. \n[109]What? \n[110]What are you doing? \n[111]It's a restaurant! \n[112]There are no booby traps! \n[113]Ha!   Some guard dog. \n[114]Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh! \n[115]Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me! \n[116]I got you! \n[117]Ugh... \n[118]You getting anything? \n[119]Bah... \n[120]Ahh!

That's not good. \n[132]Oh! Girls! What are you doing here? \n[133]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny. \n[134]Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls. \n[135]Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall! \n[136]Here is some money. Go buy some useless mall junk! Some headbands, and-- \n[137]Are you out of your gourd?    No! She just works with me. \n[138]Okay, stop! That is a song of lies. I don't even like her! Now go have fun! \n[139]Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right? They're...funny. \n[140]Huh. I am pretty fun. \n[141]All right, I'm going in. \n[142]Okay! I get it!     I get it! \n[143]You...know my name? \n[144]Wow, this looks interesting.     What is it? \n[145]Yeah, not so much. \n[146]Oh, how about this impressive trinket? \n[147]Yeah, I don't care. \n[148]Ah!    And what do we have here? \n[149]No thanks. So what's on the other side of the wall? \n[150]Date??? Boyfriend??? What??? \n[151]Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that they are...no no no, no! \n[152]Margo.    What is going on here? \n[153]Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares. Let's go. \n[154]What the-- Father?! \n[155]Oh... look at you. \n[156]Haha. He likes me! \n[157]Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on. \n[158]No! You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other! \n[159]No, no, I am-- \n[160]Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son. \n[161]I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it! \n[162]Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps! \n[163]No. I mean, sure, but it's not him. It is... ...El Macho. \n[164]No.   It is him!   And I will prove it! \n[165]Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin? \n[166]Hey, Lance!

Hello, are you...? \n[178]Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...? \n[179]Huh, tell me about it. \n[180]Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one. \n[181]Yes.   Surprisingly, it was. \n[182]Quack!     Quack!    Quack! \n[183]No!   It was horrible! \n[184]High-five! \n[185]Bump it. \n[186]Mr. Ramsbottom? \n[187]What are you doing here? \n[188]Got who? \n[189]Ah.   Alright.

Just my friend Avery. \n[7]Does it matter? \n[8]Yes, it's for his own good. \n[9]Okay, we need to choose a picture. \n[10]Hey, what celebrity do you look like? \n[11]Mmmm...no. \n[12]And it's time for you to get out there. \n[13]Whoa--really? \n[14]What's the big hurry? \n[15]Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work.

", "SILAS": "\n[1]Three weeks and we're still no closer to cracking this? \n[2]Right... bring him in. \n[3]Good afternoon, Mr. Gru. \n[4]I apologize for our methods in getting you here. \n[5]That's enough, Agent Wilde. \n[6]We are the Anti-Villain League. \n[7]An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. Rob a bank? We're not interested. Kill someone? Not our deal. But you want to melt the polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt. Fuji? Or even steal the moon? Then we notice. \n[8]We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here. I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom. \n[9]Hilarious.     Agent Wilde... \n[10]As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth. Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall. \n[11]Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal. \n[12]And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts. \n[13]Jams and...jellies? \n[14]Ramsbottom. \n[15]I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident? \n[16]Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for-- \n[17]Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear... \n[18]Hm...    Interesting... \n[19]Mr. Gru.     Please-- \n[20]Oh, hello. \n[21]We got him. \n[22]Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night, and uh, discovered this! \n[23]It's empty, but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it. He's our man. So somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one. \n[24]Well, now you're free to go back to your \"business.\" Mmmm. Jams and jellies. And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch. \n[25]Yes. But thank you--for everything. And by everything of course I mean...nothing. Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru. \n[26]Agent Wilde! ", "EDUARDO": "\n[1]Hello? \n[2]Buenos dias, my friends! I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &amp; Salsa Restaurant, across the mall. Now open for breakfast. And you are? \n[3]This is just gonna take un momento. I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need two hundred of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag. It looks something like this. \n[4]What do you think? \n[5]Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled! I pick `em up next week! Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay? \n[6]And welcome to the mall family! \n[7]Oh... somebody's going to die tonight. \n[8]Pollito! \n[9]What'd they do to you? Pollito?

Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me get you something. \n[18]Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is usually very friendly. He had a rough night. \n[19]That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no? \n[20]You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party? \n[21]So glad you could make it, mi compadre. \n[22]Hey, what's wrong? \n[23]Gru, please. I know that look all too well.

Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here. \n[4]Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause. \n[5]No, he's not Kevin anymore.

Pollito, he's usually not like this. The same thing happened the other day with... with Gru and... \n[15]Yes, I think he's somewhere around here. You two are close, no? \n[16]It's more what he didn't say. For instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League!!! \n[17]You're coming with me. \n[18]Nefario! \n[19]Oh no! What's happening to my minions? Gru? \n[20]Let me show you. \n[21]One push of this button and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death. Only this time--it's for real! \n[22]We could've ruled the world together, Gru. But now--you're gonna die. \n[23]I am not afraid of your jelly guns. ", "EDITH": "\n[1]Haha!   Yeah!
