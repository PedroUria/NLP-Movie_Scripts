{"dialogues": {"RONALD FLEURY": "\n[1]I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well, \n[2]Can I tell this story? \n[3]They started to pull and pull and pull... they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said \"STOP!\" \n[4]They stopped pulling and the doctor looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr. Fleury - you ready to have your world rocked?' And I just stared at her and she pulled this little head up out of that belly. And it was him. His head. And I looked down at him and screamed \"Kevin!!\" And he looked down at me and screamed \"Daddy!!\" \n[5]Fran? \n[6]Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's goin' on? \n[7]Where exactly? \n[8]How? \n[9]When? \n[10]Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells \n[11]Son, I gotta go to work. \n[12]I gotta go to work... \n[13]Big Fran -- you remember him? \n[14]Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud. \n[15]Something bad. \n[16]I love you. \n[17]I'm gonna try... \n[18]Can you get a ride? \n[19]Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. Special Agent Fran Manner was killed. \n[20]So was Rex Burr from State. \n[21]Fran was the best among us...we'll feel this loss the rest of our days... Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes. \n[22]Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet. \n[23]If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question? \n[24]This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient. \n[25]From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.' The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed. I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come fast. \n[26]Yeah, sure. No problem. \n[27]Ask her. \n[28]Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza. \n[29]A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack. I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding. \n[30]Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes? \n[31]I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes. \n[32]If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. \n[33]This isn't Terrorism, ma'am. It's just Serial Murder. \n[34]To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden... \n[35]When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how... \n[36]If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None. \n[37]To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.' \n[38]I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job. \n[39]It's not vengeance. \n[40]I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again. Know what my high school football coach used to say to me? \n[41]\"HIT SOMETHING.\" All night long, Coach Bailey would scream \"HIT SOMETHING.\" Every play. \n[42]I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me? \n[43]The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press. \n[44]What's your take? \n[45]White House call you with a spin? \n[46]How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow? \n[47]With the bombings? Or other things... \n[48]I know you're tracking Al Haramain. \n[49]Sometimes. Seems that just might happen. \n[50]We got some other stuff: Missing girls out of a Houston Four Seasons Hotel that was heavily populated by some \"Saudi officials.\" Little things... \n[51]I'm not saying that. \n[52]I need a favor. \n[53]When it's real and it will be real... I'll come to you with what we have first. It's yours. Exclusive. \n[54]You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm. We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some major embarrassment. \n[55]It's a free world, baby. Ask him to comment. \n[56]Tell him that I'm running the investigation. \n[57]Tell him that I'm not the nicest kid on the block. \n[58]I want fifteen minutes with him tonight. \n[59]I come to you first. No one else. \n[60]I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer. \n[61]Get back in. \n[62]Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. \n[63]She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all. \n[64]Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly. \n[65]This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR \"Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy\" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt. \n[66]And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd. \n[67]We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big... \n[68]And this ain't the Metro section. It's above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune -- You ever been to Terrell, Texas? \n[69]Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately. \n[70]Right now immediately. \n[71]-4. With a 25-man security detail- \n[72]That's too bad. \n[73]Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now. \n[74]Whose hands? \n[75]-seven-day or work-week? \n[76]I'm good. \n[77]I'm good \n[78]I'm OK...You don't think I'm OK? \n[79]I'm checked. \n[80]How we doing? \n[81]They gonna let us land? \n[82]Good. \n[83]Hunting... \n[84]Big Game hunting. \n[85]Heads on a swivel. \n[86]Special Agent Ronald Fleury. \n[87]If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed. \n[88]Colonel, have you ever been to the \n[89]You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls. \n[90]Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack? \n[91]Were Saudi Police involved in the attack? \n[92]Any word on what that third big blast was? \n[93]You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights? \n[94]What time is sunrise? \n[95]Hey... How are you? How's my boy? \n[96]I'm here... Lemme talk to my boy. \n[97]What did the Prince say? \n[98]What rules? \n[99]That's not accurate-- \n[100]Who is in charge of the investigation then? \n[101]To walk through? Are you kidding me? \n[102]Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation. \n[103]There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal- \n[104]\n[105]How have you guys been doing with the witnesses? \n[106]Why Saudi Arabia? \n[107]\n[108]So has Everyone else now. \n[109]Two nights back. Can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong? \n[110]So you really didn't see anything. \n[111]She live with her husband? \n[112]If I'm facing your house, is the Jackson home to the right or left? \n[113]Mr. Aaron Jackson? \n[114]-easy, Sir. He's a friend to us- \n[115]I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police- \n[116]Can I come back? \n[117]Your boys... \n[118]To ask about two nights ago. \n[119]...I won't pretend to know... \n[120]Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any- \n[121]Aaron- \n[122]Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that? \n[123]Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view. \n[124]Formed the plan up here: saw everything he could hit. Way too pretty a' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit. He came here a couple times. \n[125]Two big answers in two small minutes. Imagine if we had a couple days together. \n[126]I'm sure the General is good guy...and I'm just as sure he's no Investigator. \n[127]Let me help you. \n[128]And I imagine that will run until sundown? \n[129]They all get palaces this big? \n[130]I do. \n[131]I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi... \n[132]..and that if you walk 300 kilometers from the compound, you will find a rooftop where the attacks were planned. I've seen that the person in this room \"born with it\" is right there... Everything I just said came from Colonel Al-Ghazi: his observations of the scene while he was protecting us. And I think you're absolutely right Sir: that kind of instinct can't be taught: not to Falcons. Definitely not to SANG Generals. Innate or not at all. You want the murder to stop as much as I do. Let us help. \n[133]Think it will work? \n[134]They're paranoid and overly self- protective. \n[135]\n[136]\n[137]\n[138]\n[139]\n[140]\n[141]By catching Abu Hamza. \n[142]Do me a   favor and tell Janet that she and   Damon Schmidt got a date when he   gets back to the States. \n[143]We should start with the dead shooters. \n[144]Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each... \n[145]Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows... \n[146]Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them. \n[147]Would you mind doing one more thing for me? \n[148]Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men? \n[149]Where? \n[150]What about the others? \n[151]What, the Liza Minelli shirt? \n[152]What was odd? \n[153]Yeah. \n[154]Thank you. \n[155]That's one of the many things we're trying to find out... \n[156]How are your Sons? \n[157]That's the name of a clinical psychologist. Works with Embassy kids...apparently very good at explaining violence- \n[158]I thought maybe your Boys...without their Mom anymore...might ask you why sometime... \n[159]I will find the man responsible for the death of your wife. We're close. \n[160]Then tomorrow I'll come back. \n[161]We know where he lives? \n[162]You don't seem very excited. \n[163]Where? \n[164]A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred years. \n[165]Agreed. \n[166]Yes, I do. \n[167]Is your first name `Colonel?' \n[168]OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or shoot him or something? \n[169]This place is community service? \n[170]Why did he turn himself in? \n[171]How does he know he slept soundly? \n[172]Is that why you quit? \n[173]How do we find him? \n[174]Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts... \n[175]\n[176]What you got? \n[177]Why? \n[178]Where's Muaath? \n[179]\n[180]He's gone... This shrapnel look like the stuff you pulled at the morgue? \n[181]Bolts? \n[182]Wing nuts? \n[183]Razor blades? \n[184]\n[185]This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it. \n[186]Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it. \n[187]You need water? \n[188]You do? How did you know we were here? \n[189]-Ellis Leach? \n[190]We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These are teenagers... children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them. \n[191]Hello? Yes, Sir. We're all here and healthy. I'm sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over. These don't feel like anything resembling senior leadership- -thank you Sir. I do. \n[192]Please do me one favor before we board: warn every `Coalition-of-the- Willing' or whatever the hell we're calling our Iraq allies now, that pictures of their Riyadh embassies were found in this Cell's safe- house. \n[193]What do you think? \n[194]Yeah. \n[195]I'm thinking about New York - February 26, 1993. The first time they tried to hit the Trade Towers. \n[196]Remember how we caught that cell? \n[197]Four hundred dollars. For four hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy. Just like this. The cell came back. \n[198]I'll be back. \n[199]Is he responding to the call? Dropped back... \n[200]You whole? \n[201]\n[202]\n[203]Hands up -- you're gonna fall- \n[204]\n[205]\n[206]\n[207]We go in the front door. Haytham - cover the stairs. Janet - hallway. Watch the side doors. Watch your backs. \n[208]Is Allah on the other side of that door? \n[209]Everybody OK? \n[210]...Don't... \n[211]...drop it, Son...please... \n[212]You got him. You got him... You got him. \n[213]Yeah. \n[214]Yeah, there are... But you want to know something? \n[215]You're not one of them. (alt: There's a lot of good guys, too) ", "FLEURY": "\n[1]I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys? \n[2]Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys? \n[3]Glenda, I want you to look at me. \n[4]Please... I'm going to take care of this. Whoever did this... I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can't change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for this. \n[5]Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly active... \n[6]If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine. \n[7]I'll just be right out here. \n[8]If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood? \n[9]Thanks for volunteering. \n[10]Thanks anyway. \n[11]Yup. \n[12]Nope. \n[13]Nope. \n[14]Not really. \n[15]Nope. \n[16]...heads on a swivel, people. \n[17]What time tomorrow morning? \n[18]Saudi slow roll... \n[19]What you doing? \n[20]I'm missing you. \n[21]I'm in Saudi Arabia. \n[22]Yeah... I saw him... I saw him. \n[23]Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall. \n[24]Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man. \n[25]I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. \n[26]Is that right? \n[27]Enough. \n[28]Saudi Slow Roll. \n[29]Of course we won't. \n[30]I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime. \n[31]So, if you're not running the investigation...who is? \n[32]I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits... Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them. \n[33]Let me talk to them. \n[34]Which kids were those? \n[35]That's what makes this a War. \n[36]Watt-tee... \n[37]Were any of these shooters your men? \n[38]They got into the compound. Somehow...took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride? \n[39]I understand that. Those men were your men-- \n[40]I'm sorry. \n[41]Where was this car when they hit it? \n[42]The car was parked here? \n[43]Backed in? \n[44]They were attacked from the front. Must have assumed the killers were fellow officers... Have any of these men been identified? \n[45]Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings? \n[46]Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate? \n[47]That building sees all three crime scenes. \n[48]Could you ask? \n[49]We're already seeing the crime- scenes individually -- why not all at once? \n[50]-time. I understand. \n[51]You have to ask the General, then the General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that... is the Prince the end of the chain? \n[52]We'll be at the Community Center. Janet, wanna play hoops? \n[53]You've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet? \n[54]Look for yourself. \n[55]I see. \n[56]You want to tell her that? \n[57]I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable. \n[58]See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside? \n[59]She must pretty much see it all. Right? \n[60]Where is she? \n[61]Let's wake her up. \n[62]What's gas running a gallon out here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon? \n[63]Feel like I'm back home in Detroit. \n[64]How do they get them? \n[65]Could Hamza get this equipment? \n[66]\n[67]\n[68]There's at least three more of them. \n[69]May peace be with all of us,   my friend. ", "GRANT SYKES": "\n[1]From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder... \n[2]This is how they do it. \n[3]That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination... has access to Saudi uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus. \n[4]He taught her how to shoot, she taught him most everything else. Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet something...Something not very nice. Townie didn't see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw. \n[5]SAC Fleury took care of him. \n[6]If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career. \n[7]Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning? \n[8]Mars. \n[9]Go easy on my kin. \n[10]What's going on in there? \n[11]Feels like you got a beast in there, Fleury. \n[12]\"Good\" is 6:00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you... sun's creeping through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes... that's \"good.\" \n[13]I think you're not entirely clear right now. That's OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got you, but you got to check yourself. \n[14]OK. I'm just checking that you checked. \n[15]And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table... \n[16]You have portable lights on-scene? \n[17]We only have seven days: we work around the clock. \n[18]We're safe during the day? \n[19]You interviewed witnesses? \n[20]Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers? \n[21]Do you know yet? \n[22]That's against fire code. \n[23]Slow roll... gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and- \n[24]Hole is the case. See, there's \"evidence\" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are \"clues.\" Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime. \n[25]Glad to hear it. So can we get in there? \n[26]\n[27]General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet... \n[28]That was impressive. \n[29]Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play the \"I'm going to the press card\" like three more times. So, maybe. \n[30]\n[31]Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here... see what's really going on. Understand? \n[32]C-VIN hunting--Data Plates-- Something drivable blew up. That's pretty obvious. Feels like ANFO to me, boys--Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil. Let's dry this hole and see if we can't figure what she was. Gotta pump? \n[33]Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact.

Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other? \n[49]I'm serious. Beer will open up your subconscious. Canned beer especially.

What was that? \n[3]Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right? \n[4]Same thing. Followed by machine gun crews. Collect and kill. \n[5]They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way. \n[6]I'll be fine. \n[7]Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer. \n[8]--the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages.

I'm definitely going. \n[10]`Grant's age is a liability.' \n[11]I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia. \n[12]It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born.

They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say? \n[17]That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television. \n[18]\n[19]They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war.
