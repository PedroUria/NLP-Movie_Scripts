{"dialogues": {"BRODY": "\n[1]Late. \n[2]Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there... ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares. \n[3]How'm I supposed to do that? \n[4]Shouldn't he be at home? \n[5]Do I have to talk to those two? \n[6]Very impressive ceremony. Good speech. \n[7]Me neither. \n[8]All of us thank you, okay? \n[9]No. Find your brother, okay? \n[10]Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man? \n[11]Because they're playing our song. \n[12]Sorry, I'm all booked up... Come, m'dear. \n[13]Remember 1959, the Jersey shore? \n[14]I did, I did. \n[15]Listen -- what are you doing later? \n[16]Right. \n[17]Home it is. \n[18]You're getting a little big for this. \n[19]Mmmm. \n[20]Sean's awake. \n[21]Good. \n[22]Mrs. Silvera? \n[23]Need a ride? \n[24]Some people. \n[25]Better yet. \n[26]Too late, it's written. \n[27]Len, pay the two dollars. \n[28]dock, Sean tagging along \n[29]What? \n[30]On your own time? \n[31]Then check it out. I'll be in the office. \n[32]Where to? \n[33]Sailing? \n[34]Watch your kid brother, huh? \n[35]I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction... \n[36]Thanks. What else is out there? \n[37]I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others. \n[38]In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please... \n[39]Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney. \n[40]Dancing? \n[41]Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908. \n[42]I just made it up. It means, \"Get me out of there.\" What the hell's that? \n[43]Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that. \n[44]If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel. \n[45]Hendricks, get a description of that dance. \n[46]There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing. \n[47]Try dragging. \n[48]Stay on it. I don't care how long it takes. \n[49]\n[50]Oh, yeah. Sure. \n[51]It's good with coffee. \n[52]What're you guys doing today? \n[53]Every day? \n[54]You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school. \n[55]You'll have to make up your own mind about that. \n[56]In the den. \n[57]There's a lot going on. \n[58]Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He's another one. \n[59]Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating? \n[60]What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old cars? Bartending? \n[61]Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day? \n[62]Look, humor the old man -- just be careful. \n[63]Don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh? We've had a lot of trouble. \n[64]You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay? \n[65]I'll be at the office. \n[66]As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big! \n[67]See? What'd I tell you? \n[68]Look at that! \n[69]Come on, let's check the bite radius. \n[70]Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth? \n[71]The Shark's mouth. \n[72]The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it? \n[73]But that's what we're here to find out, right? \n[74]You stay here a minute. \n[75]You heard me. \n[76]Look, I know a little bit about sharks. \n[77]I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan... \n[78]That's it. \n[79]Is there one in these waters? \n[80]Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish... \n[81]Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this. \n[82]That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around... \n[83]Sound? \n[84]So there's one around here. \n[85]Could you just keep that crowd back, please? \n[86]You stay right here. You're going in with me. \n[87]Andy can sail in it. \n[88]She'll understand. \n[89]I don't want to discuss it. \n[90]Can't you tell? \n[91]Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy... \n[92]No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it. \n[93]Because I say so. \n[94]We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone. \n[95]Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one. \n[96]Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator... \n[97]I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you? \n[98]We have to do something. \n[99]I know, I know... \n[100]It's still a good idea. \n[101]Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers... \n[102]Two of them are still missing! \n[103]Maybe they are! \n[104]Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it! \n[105]Someone has to do something. \n[106]Come on, give a guy a break. \n[107]Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa... \n[108]Hoo! Cold! \n[109]Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard. A little closer... Here y'go... \n[110]Gotcha! \n[111]In here. \n[112]You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess. \n[113]The woman passenger on the boat that blew up. \n[114]What about that camera? \n[115]That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it? \n[116]Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it... \n[117]You got it. \n[118]Not the drugstore! \n[119]The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it? \n[120]Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay? \n[121]Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone. \n[122]For me? \n[123]Damn. \n[124]Not till next year. \n[125]Oh, hi -- How was dinner? \n[126]Santos' place. \n[127]Oww! \n[128]Nothing. \n[129]That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff? \n[130]Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal. \n[131]No. \n[132]Michael. \n[133]You want to come here a minute? \n[134]Hiya yourself. \n[135]I got something for you to do tomorrow. \n[136]Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats. \n[137]No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts. \n[138]He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night. \n[139]Tomorrow night. Out of the water. \n[140]I know what you're going to say. \n[141]In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune? \n[142]The goddamn smell is always the same. \n[143]Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake! \n[144]Out of the water! Everyone out of the water! \n[145]Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water! \n[146]Out of the water! Now! Everyone! \n[147]No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear! \n[148]Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm... \n[149]Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble... \n[150]It's all right, everything's all right... \n[151]Polly, no calls, please... Okay, okay. Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What pictures... I'll be right down... \n[152]You said something about a camera. \n[153]Did you get any pictures? \n[154]Oh, Jesus. That boat... \n[155]What else you got? \n[156]Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around. \n[157]That one there. That one... \n[158]Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof! \n[159]Perfect. Look at this --- \n[160]What? \n[161]Temporarily? Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking? \n[162]Yeah. Why? \n[163]Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along. \n[164]It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there! \n[165]What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills. \n[166]You're damn right that's what it is. \n[167]What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before! \n[168]My ass! \n[169]There is nothing to discuss. \n[170]Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary. \n[171]Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way. \n[172]It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever! \n[173]Go ahead, whatever it's worth. \n[174]That's great. \n[175]That's great too. Gorgeous. \n[176]You look about 22 years old sitting there. Like you were doing homework... \n[177]Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all. \n[178]What'd I say? \n[179]Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that. \n[180]No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous. \n[181]Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me... \n[182]...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass... \n[183]Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw... \n[184]I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm... \n[185]Good morning, America... \n[186]Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss. \n[187]Don't rush into it -- we may need the income. \n[188]Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man. \n[189]The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name... \n[190]Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice. \n[191]Just one minute... \n[192]What the hell happened? \n[193]How'd this happen? \n[194]When? \n[195]How long ago? \n[196]Going out. \n[197]You can't stop me. \n[198]Mike's out there. \n[199]Untie that rope. \n[200]Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there. \n[201]Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there. \n[202]Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over. \n[203]Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne? \n[204]Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now. \n[205]There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port. \n[206]That's it. Just do it, all right? \n[207]If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port! \n[208]It's not his boat. \n[209]Nope... Hold on... \n[210]Tina! \n[211]It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey -- \n[212]What is it? What's there? \n[213]I need a hand here... \n[214]I knew it. I goddamn well told them. \n[215]Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol. \n[216]Skip that. What about those kids out sailing? \n[217]He left them? \n[218]Get him the hell back there! We got possible fatalities! Brody out... \n[219]I'm going out there. \n[220]Mike's out there. \n[221]Get her in. Get them both in. \n[222]Where are they? \n[223]Never mind that shit. Just point. \n[224]Got it. \n[225]Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you? \n[226]It's me. Any fix on those Kids? \n[227]For Christ's sake, get going! I'm all alone out here! \n[228]Where the hell is Francis Shoal? \n[229]I'm all alone out here. \n[230]Shit. \n[231]Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in. \n[232]Harbor Air, do you read? Over? \n[233]Where the hell is Air One? \n[234]Did he raise the Kids? \n[235]Yeah? Then what? \n[236]Did you say Cable Junction? \n[237]When? \n[238]Thank Christ. \n[239]I'm coming alongside! \n[240]Mike? Is that you? \n[241]It's okay. What happened? \n[242]At least you're safe. What about the others? \n[243]Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others? \n[244]What? \n[245]Which way? \n[246]Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here. \n[247]Stay at the lighthouse! \n[248]Hang on! \n[249]I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay... \n[250]Can you get a line to me? \n[251]Son of a bitch is stuck! \n[252]climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying to pull the cable free. \n[253]Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull! \n[254]Sean! Hang on! \n[255]Hang on! Just hang on! \n[256]I'm coming! \n[257]Andy! Use the lights! The lights! \n[258]Sean! \n[259]You bastard! \n[260]Come here, you son-of-a-bitch! \n[261]Over here! You bastard! Over here \n[262]Possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs. \n[263]Come and get me! Come and get me! \n[264]watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's worklights provide light now. \n[265]Sean? \n[266]Sure they did... ", "MIKE": "\n[1]How old is your cousin? \n[2]I'm not crazy about blind dates. \n[3]Yeah, it's her job. \n[4]No. \n[5]Great. \n[6]Okay, okay. Got to go. \n[7]No place special. Just hanging out. \n[8]No. \n[9]I said, 'No.' \n[10]Waiting for Andy. \n[11]I will, I will. \n[12]I don't need you. Andy's here. \n[13]How was dive class? \n[14]Yeah. Go on, beat it. \n[15]I hope that's the cousin. \n[16]Real fast. \n[17]Eat Cheerios. \n[18]I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing. \n[19]What else is there to do? \n[20]Do I have to? \n[21]I'm going. \n[22]Bartending? I'm 17. \n[23]Because. \n[24]I'll be careful. I'll see y'later. \n[25]Okay, okay. \n[26]We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there. \n[27]It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know... \n[28]Too hot for those two? I can't believe it. \n[29]They're moving pretty fast. \n[30]Can we go now? \n[31]Oh, c'mon. \n[32]I'll be right there. Wait up. \n[33]Pop... \n[34]We came out in my boat. \n[35]I got a date! \n[36]She won't. \n[37]Dad, please... \n[38]Why me? \n[39]Is Hooper coming to dinner? \n[40]Yeah? \n[41]What is it? \n[42]I kind of had plans... \n[43]Hey, come on... \n[44]Dad, please... \n[45]Yeah. \n[46]Up there. \n[47]I know. \n[48]I don't know. \n[49]Why shouldn't I? \n[50]I'm not sure I can. \n[51]Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach... \n[52]That's not it. My dad told me not to go. \n[53]No. \n[54]Great. \n[55]Yeah. \n[56]Maybe. \n[57]No. \n[58]Quiet!  Shhh! \n[59]Okay, okay. Close your door. \n[60]Yeah. \n[61]Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home. \n[62]Would you take him? \n[63]Maybe. \n[64]I can go out if I want to. \n[65]Why not? \n[66]Shut up. \n[67]Hang on... \n[68]The tide's turning. \n[69]Sure. \n[70]Name it. \n[71]I don't care. \n[72]That's the pin -- the buoy. \n[73]Yee-hah! \n[74]We better go back in. \n[75]We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide. \n[76]I was counting on hours. \n[77]We're trying, we're trying. \n[78]Hey, Fetterman -- You got company. \n[79]Doug's down! \n[80]Pop.

Easy... \n[63]Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's sleeping. \n[64]Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed. \n[65]What're you going to do today? \n[66]I'll give notice. \n[67]Sean's not up yet.

Did your mom put all this together? \n[3]Is she responsible for the punch? \n[4]Good. It's terrible. \n[5]Okay, you did that. \n[6]Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. \n[7]Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. \n[8]Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. \n[9]Lucky.

Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity. \n[2]Holiday Inn joins the Amity Shores development condominium complex in a welcome expression renewed interest in Amity Island as the hub of the Northeast Recreational Vacation Wonderland. We're happy once again to be in the center of things, where the action is... We've had our share of hard times and long winters and the past few years have not been easy. But today, the sun is rising on a new Amity, a new island filled with promise. Len Peterson's Amity Shores Development is an exciting addition to our island. The Holiday Inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. Amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony. \n[3]...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel... \n[4]Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community. \n[5]This money tree, you may have noticed, is made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards the community. $500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship fund... \n[6]Go ahead, Tina. \n[7]Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special decorations. And now, the Amity High School band. Refreshments on the patio, everyone... \n[8]Hello, hello. It went well, I thought. \n[9]Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you? \n[10]I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going. \n[11]We're alone. \n[12]Are you serious? \n[13]No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic. \n[14]Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money. \n[15]We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know. \n[16]And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one. \n[17]Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke. \n[18]A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident. \n[19]There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims? \n[20]Bullshit. \n[21]What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything. \n[22]Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that. \n[23]I've got to get back to work. \n[24]I'll say hello for you. \n[25]Your dad got you working? \n[26]You know where your dad is? \n[27]Oh, for Christ's sake. \n[28]Len, can I see you a minute? \n[29]Brody's riding his tower. \n[30]Wave to my son. \n[31]Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus. \n[32]It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it. \n[33]Oh, my God... \n[34]Running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering... \n[35]Brody's a good man. \n[36]He thought he had a good reason. \n[37]How many people were there? \n[38]So? So? \n[39]Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences. \n[40]All right. Let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy. \n[41]I believe we have a quorum, and informally, I suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes... \n[42]Martin, this is kind of an official meeting \n[43]Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer. \n[44]It's nothing I can see. \n[45]Martin, it could be anything. \n[46]Be reasonable, please... \n[47]Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something? \n[48]Very well then. It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor? \n[49]I'm sorry, but I respect his convictions. The motion is carried. \n[50]Martin? Could you come in please?

More, with this wind. \n[33]I can't stop thinking! \n[34]I think we're changing course a little. \n[35]The wind drift is lateral. \n[36]Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way... \n[37]Stop paddling! \n[38]Maybe the bottom. \n[39]Back down! \n[40]We got it! \n[41]Come around again! \n[42]It's killing us! \n[43]Swim for it!

Jackie can come back in this boat! \n[6]Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in... \n[7]Might as well. \n[8]What was that about? \n[9]Anyone need an extra line? \n[10]As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow. \n[11]Three knot current? \n[12]First we got to get there. \n[13]Sean! Sean! \n[14]He's got to help or it won't work. \n[15]Can someone help me rig a jury rudder? We might steer this... \n[16]She's hysterical, goddamn it! \n[17]Go ahead, slow. \n[18]Lucy! Look out!

Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage. \n[7]Nope. Got it in my boat. \n[8]Great day!

Follow Marge as she swims. \n[11]The inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom. \n[12]the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck fast.

It lunges at Brody as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it. \n[4]on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it, tearing it off the raft, shaking everything. \n[5]lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it passes... \n[6]turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brody. \n[7]Attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- then the live copper core is reached. Zap! \n[8]dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies.
