{"dialogues": {"SMILEY": "\n[1]Hello, Peter. \n[2]Have I time to change? \n[3]Are we going far? \n[4]Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you. \n[5]Very well.  Very bonny... \n[6]I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you? \n[7]I am retired, Oliver. \n[8]No. \n[9]What did you say to him? \n[10]I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him. \n[11]No, we never did. \n[12]Control lived with his sister didn't he? \n[13]We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year. \n[14]How long was H. Staunton a tenant? \n[15]Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four. \n[16]Thank you. Anywhere will do. \n[17]No. Peter, I need you to do something for me... \n[18]I want to see the records of staff recently retired. While you're there get the handbook on staff duties... and the diagram of the Circus's reorganization under Alleline... \n[19]I know that car. \n[20]Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her. \n[21]That was one of her talents. \n[22]Hmm? \n[23]Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps that's what we have to become? A little paranoid? \n[24]Your \"clean sweep.\" What if the Mole was actually behind that sweep? What if each of us, whether we knew it or not, represented a threat to the Mole? \n[25]Yes. Yes, he did. \n[26]Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to... \n[27]... Alleline's \"special source.\" \n[28]Everything is connected. \n[29]Return to Oxford please. \n[30]Oh, I brought... \n[31]You left the Circus shortly after I retired... \n[32]Why? \n[33]Which bone? \n[34]Polyakov. \n[35]Stationed where? \n[36]Esterhase said that? \n[37]But you disagreed? \n[38]Never? \n[39]What did you do? \n[40]What did they say? \n[41]What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that? \n[42]It was the war, Connie. \n[43]Where did you get it? \n[44]If it's genuine it's gold-dust. But its topicality makes it suspect. \n[45]Where does it come from? What's the access? \n[46]But how could he possibly have access to...? \n[47]We? \n[48]If Witchcraft is genuine... \n[49]Yes. \n[50]Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund. \n[51]For a Mister Ellis. \n[52]It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names. \n[53]The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was \n[54]someone giving him a thousand pounds two months later? \n[55]Hello, Ricki. \n[56]You missed a wedge. \n[57]Where've you been, Ricki? \n[58]Who is? \n[59]I'm going to try. How long have you been here? \n[60]I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it. \n[61]What do you want Ricki? \n[62]What woman? \n[63]You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? \n[64]Sense what? \n[65]What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing? \n[66]She had children in Russia? \n[67]But you didn't? \n[68]And what did your message say, Ricki? \n[69]What else? \n[70]I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something. \n[71]Yes. I quite see that. \n[72]And what else? \n[73]What happened next Ricki? \n[74]Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe. \n[75]I'll go find her. \n[76]I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. If you have the slightest reservation... \n[77]If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone. \n[78]Ricki's been helping us Peter. He's been telling us all about his adventures. \n[79]As you did take the trouble to steal it... \n[80]Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information? \n[81]What was the date? \n[82]Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? \n[83]Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. \n[84]You recognize that handwriting? That's Toby Esterhase. \n[85]Secrecy is a habit. \n[86]What for? \n[87]I met him once. Karla. \n[88]In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them. \n[89]One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die. \n[90]Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there... \n[91]The Americans have had him tortured. \n[92]No fingernails. It's incredibly hot. I'm very tired and all I want to do is get this over with and get back home. Things weren't going well with Ann. \n[93]I give him the usual pitch... Come to the West and we can give you a comfortable life. After questioning. Or you can catch your plane and fly home and be shot, like Bykov, Shur, Muranov... \n[94]Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way. \n[95]Use my lighter. \n[96]\"We could arrange for her to join you, we have a lot of stock to trade. If you go back, she'll be ostracised. Think of her. Think about how much she...\" \n[97]Kept harping on about the damn wife! Telling him more about me, than... Should have walked out, of course, but for some reason... it seemed important to save this one.  So I go on. \"Know you're a chain-smoker, help yourself,\" \"We're not so very different you and I..\" \n[98]Look, we've both spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in one another's systems. Don't you think it's time to recognise there is as little worth on your side as there is on mine? \n[99]Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\" \n[100]Yes.  And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt. \n[101]That's the thing.  I can't remember. \n[102]After today, Peter you have to assume they're watching you. If there's anything you need tidied up... now's the time. \n[103]How.  I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you? \n[104]You rang my house? \n[105]What did you say? \n[106]Go on. \n[107]The Saville. \n[108]Peter... \n[109]It's not him, Peter. \n[110]Because he was at my house that night. With Ann. \n[111]I quite like this. \n[112]Yes. Pleasant enough. \n[113]Which means I was...? \n[114]What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory? \n[115]But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why? \n[116]Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be? \n[117]What did you tell them? \n[118]No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin. \n[119]What was your last line of defence? \n[120]Why? \n[121]What else? \n[122]Did they ask about me at all? \n[123]What did he say about me? \n[124]That was well said. \n[125]Try and put it all behind you, Jim. \n[126]Jim? \n[127]Nobody you need concern yourself with. An unfortunate... \n[128]He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor. \n[129]Toby Esterhase. \n[130]He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it. \n[131]Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about \"Tinker, Tailor?\" \n[132]Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had. \n[133]What exactly did Irina say? \n[134]Perfectly, Minister.  There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house. \n[135]It's Lacon's advice I'm following.  You told me to follow in Control's footsteps. \n[136]I'm glad you take some of the credit. \n[137]The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla. \n[138]Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that. \n[139]Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in. \n[140]We are not the prize. We're the bait. \n[141]You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the \"gold\" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that? \n[142]We have one thing the Mole wants. \n[143]I'll do my utmost, Ricki. \n[144]Keep walking please. \n[145]I want to talk about loyalty Toby. Control recruited you when you were trying to escape from Hungary didn't he? A wanted man. Saved you from a KGB bullet, didn't he? And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master? \n[146]It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby. \n[147]Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus... \n[148]The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they? \n[149]Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know. \n[150]Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor? \n[151]To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby? \n[152]You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft? \n[153]I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is. He's Karla. \n[154]One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels. \n[155]Are you still a wanted man, Toby? \n[156]You picked the wrong side, Toby. \n[157]Give me the address. Where do you meet Polyakov? \n[158]What are the safety signals? \n[159]Where is the mike, Mrs McCraig? \n[160]And what's the procedure? \n[161]If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we? \n[162]How's he look? \n[163]I'm here, Mendel. \n[164]I was assured there would be no coercion. \n[165]If I can. \n[166]Of course. \n[167]I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux. \n[168]Yes, yes you did. That was good of you.  I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you? \n[169]Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission? \n[170]To say what? \n[171]To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along. \n[172]Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus? \n[173]What are you then? \n[174]Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann? \n[175]Up to a point. \n[176]\"Tailor.\" \n[177]Shall we begin? ", "PETER GUILLAM": "\n[1]Has that been cleared? \n[2]Peter Guillam... \n[3]Very well. Is this where he got out? \n[4]Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention. \n[5]He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then. \n[6]Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you? \n[7]Cut it on a drawer handle. When are we going to get some new furniture round here? \n[8]Lunch. \n[9]Smothered by the Mothers. \n[10]What does? \n[11]Here. \n[12]What? \n[13]Citroen. \n[14]Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out. \n[15]Probably relieved. She always struck me as unhinged. \n[16]Jim Prideaux. \n[17]You look tired. \n[18]Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation? \n[19]Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today. \n[20]Time you oiled this thing, isn't it? \n[21]You're kidding? \n[22]Mind the jewels. \n[23]You don't look pleased to see me, Bill? \n[24]Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse. \n[25]As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do? \n[26]Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse. \n[27]Thanks... \n[28]So, chit me. \n[29]Visiting aunts. \n[30]Oh to hell, who is it? \n[31]Hello?  Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair? \n[32]At least get on to the main dealers first... \n[33]Have you got the number? \n[34]Well, hold on... \n[35]... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a minute, will you? \n[36]Thanks. \n[37]946-0335. OK? Thanks. \n[38]Of course. \n[39]You might just throw that into the lift for me, mark it for the second floor, save me filling out more bloody chits? \n[40]Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong. \n[41]Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon. \n[42]I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled. \n[43]But I haven't been seeing him! So get your facts straight and get \n[44]Nothing would surprise me about Tarr. \n[45]What for? \n[46]The hotel. I have to see George. \n[47]George? \n[48]He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds! \n[49]I stole that, because of you! I spied on my own. Do you know how that makes me feel? \n[50]He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing... \n[51]What about the money? \n[52]\"Enquiries to the fifth floor.\" \n[53]Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr? \n[54]In case I didn't make it out of the Circus... \n[55]I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done. \n[56]I'm sorry. \n[57]I wanted to believe Tarr was lying.  All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it. \n[58]What did he say? \n[59]That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in? \n[60]What did he look like? \n[61]Haydon heard the news at his club? \n[62]At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running. \n[63]So how did he know? Oh Jesus, George... \n[64]Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known? \n[65]Then how did he know? \n[66]Who? \n[67]You alright? \n[68]Yes, George. I'll watch. \n[69]You'll go... \n[70]The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. The flame that lit the battles wreck, shone round him o'er the dead... \n[71]He's here. ", "RICKI TARR": "\n[1]Minister Lacon. \n[2]I want to talk to Control. And I want breakfast. \n[3]Hello Mister Smiley. You remember me. \n[4]Losing my touch. \n[5]I know what I must look like. Rip Van Winkle. Feel like him. I could sleep for a year. Two years. \n[6]Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me. \n[7]Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason. You going to find him then? The Mole? \n[8]Few days. Needed somewhere to hide. \n[9]Old habits. \n[10]Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later. \n[11]There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from Karla. \n[12]Her name's Irina. \n[13]I met her in Istanbul. They'd found some Russian trade delegate, name of Boris. He was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him. \n[14]I took one look and saw that he was a hood, Moscow trained. \n[15]You baby-sit this one. \n[16]Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. Just wanted to check you were alright. \n[17]Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her. \n[18]A secret. \n[19]I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it... \n[20]We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses. \n[21]Me, I know women. She said she had a secret. The mother of all secrets. Said she'd only tell Control. She wanted to trade. New life for her and her kids. \n[22]That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus. \n[23]Wanted to find out more first. So, I waited her out. \n[24]You can't expect them to jump at every offer of service.(Beat. Carefully) If they had more information... \n[25]Well, if you won't tell me more, there's nothing I can do. \n[26]I promise. \n[27]Fuck off. \n[28]Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect. \n[29]I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself. \n[30]I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus. \n[31]That she had information concerning a Double Agent. \n[32]I was just trying to... to get the proper attention.  And I told them to tell Mister Guillam that this was the reason I hadn't come home, not because I'd defected or anything. \n[33]I waited for a reply. \n[34]I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling. \n[35]They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but... I don't know why... I keep thinking about her. \n[36]I want to get her out. I owe her that. \n[37]Who's going to keep you safe? \n[38]S'right. \n[39]November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening. \n[40]She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla. \n[41]If I go... \n[42]... I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot... \n[43]We're gonna live in Paris out of your hair. You'll get her back? \n[44]Maybe I want them to find me. \n[45]Ben stays here. \n[46]Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus. \n[47]Read it aloud. \n[48]That's the way Percy boy! You keep stalling. I better warn you Ben, there's some lousy people in this outfit. Don't trust a fucking one of them. ", "PRIDEAUX": "\n[1]Hand those out. \n[2]Come down here. \n[3]Boy with the marble. \n[4]Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name? \n[5]New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story? \n[6]Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that? \n[7]Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at? \n[8]You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right? \n[9]Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here. \n[10]Got your specs on Jumbo? \n[11]Who's the fellow down there? \n[12]Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? \n[13]Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...? \n[14]It's alright, old fella. Don't cry. Nobody ever watched like you, did they? Off you go, now. \n[15]Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris. \n[16]What information? \n[17]What else? \n[18]You were Beggarman. \n[19]I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness. \n[20]I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty. \n[21]Everything. \n[22]I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there.  Did they? \n[23]My networks in Hungary. Did they get out? \n[24]The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke. \n[25]Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation. \n[26]Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing. \n[27]One of them did. \n[28]He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\" He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription. \n[29]I told him to go to hell. \n[30]If they had one man like Bill Haydon they could call it set and match! \n[31]He gave me a cigarette. \n[32]I thought it was my last one. \n[33]I don't know her. \n[34]Do you know who she was? \n[35]I don't want you hanging around here.

You bloody pariah. \n[7]We like the Scalp-hunters to know their place. On the second floor. \n[8]Heard it was quiet down there. \n[9]Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing. \n[10]Get out. \n[11]Tell me. \n[12]I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club... Tell me. \n[13]You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged... \n[14]Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him to pull in the Hungarian agents, anyone we're onto. Tell him to get down to the London School of Economics, sandbag some bloody students and put them on ice at Sarratt. \n[15]We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked. \n[16]Good flight? \n[17]I was just passing, thought I'd call in. Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up. She said she'll be down in a minute. \n[18]That's what I'm dropping off. \n[19]Awful daub really but Ann expressed a liking... What's keeping her? \n[20]It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow. \n[21]I rather hoped you would do a little light house-keeping for me. \n[22]There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here. \n[23]There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund. \n[24]Damn it! I got him back, didn't \n[25]Yes, as a matter of fact he did. \n[26]So did you. \n[27]I had to pick a side George. It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has grown so very ugly, don't you think? \n[28]I'm not his bloody office boy. \n[29]I'm someone who made his mark. \n[30]Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that?

She's in the pink, and so on. \n[10]Do you know this man Tarr? \n[11]He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me. \n[12]He said there's a mole. Right at the top of the Circus. And that he's been there for years. \n[13]I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby. \n[14]But the Minister agreed with Sir Percy. New broom, clean sweep, wheat from the chaff and all that. And to be fair, Percy has had some marvellous results since you and Control left... \n[15]Anyway, it does mean you're rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it? Outside the family? \n[16]Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion. \n[17]He never mentioned his suspicions to you? \n[18]I just thought... with you being \"his man\", so to speak. \n[19]I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest... \n[20]Damn it, George, this is your generation, your legacy! \n[21]If there's any truth in this you'd think you'd want to... \n[22]Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man. \n[23]Damn thing cost a fortune. Three years of lessons and all I hear is Edelweiss. You and Ann never had children, did you? \n[24]On our way to La Boh\u00e8me. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report? \n[25]Looking a little unhinged yourself, George. \n[26]Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest... that poor chap...? \n[27]How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material. \n[28]There is no connection. \n[29]Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat... ", "PERCY ALLELINE": "\n[1]I wish I could have done more, Control. \n[2]You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him. \n[3]You're losing your sense of proportion, Connie. Perhaps it's time you went out into the real world. \n[4]A new secret source of mine. \n[5]He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making. \n[6]We have named the operation \"Witchcraft.\" \n[7]The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence! \n[8]It's all office politics here. \n[9]Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners... \n[10]And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley! Changes. \n[11]I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Minister. \n[12]My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt. I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms. \n[13]I'm not interested in a one-off trade. I want on-going access to American intelligence. \n[14]With Witchcraft on our side, I think we can get anything we bloody-well want. \n[15]I followed the recipe. \n[16]For God's sake Mary... \n[17]Esterhase, I'll have no phone calls, tell them... \n[18]Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally? \n[19]What are you getting up to down there these days, apart from chasing our virgins... \n[20]Arabs... You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right Bill? \n[21]How's Ricki Tarr these days? \n[22]I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr. \n[23]What's that shrug for? \n[24]I'm talking to you about a murderer. I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section! I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back! Don't damn well shrug at me! How'd you like a term in prison? \n[25]So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised? \n[26]And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you? \n[27]Your man's a defector, Guillam. Got turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us! \n[28]Never mind what for! To muddy the water, that's what for! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! The point is this - he's heading for home. The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood? Anyone you see at this table. But not another damn soul! ", "CONTROL": "\n[1]You did all you could, Percy. Well, a man should know when to leave the party. \n[2]Smiley is leaving with me. \n[3]Step into my lair. \n[4]Sit down and take a look at this nonsense. \n[5]Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on. \n[6]I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it. \n[7]Shut up, Esterhase. \n[8]Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake. \n[9]Percy doesn't feel like telling. \n[10]Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret. \n[11]Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us. \n[12]Your bloody Yanks! \n[13]I should have left you where I found you. \n[14]\n[15]I don't trust miracles. \n[16]Percy? \n[17]Percy. Did you do this? \n[18]You penny pinching Scot. Can you not take a bloody order. No one is to tamper with the recipe. It's going to take us five hours to get drunk on this piss water. \n[19]Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out. \n[20]You weren't followed? \n[21]Trust no-one, Jim. Especially not in the main stream. What Hungarian identities do you still have running? \n[22]If you're caught, you keep me out of it. You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise. Understood? \n[23]I've had an offer of service. A Hungarian General. Wants to come over. I want you to meet him. He has information I need, Jim. \n[24]Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of politics. \n[25]Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus. \n[26]There's a rotten apple Jim and we have to find it. \n[27]I'm   so close I can almost feel his   heart beating. I know it's one   of five men. All I want from you   is one word. \n[28]Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the next photo) Haydon - Tailor. Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor.

Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong. \n[13]Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly... \n[14]... the busiest culture vulture that Embassy ever had. \n[15]For years we'd been hearing rumours that Karla was building a private army of his own, outside Moscow Centre.
