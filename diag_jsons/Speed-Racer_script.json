{"dialogues": {"SPEED": "\n[1]What do I do? \n[2]No way! \n[3]No! I hear it! \n[4]Uh-uh. The jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper to Speed. \n[5]Now! Rex smiles, hitting the gas, launching the car into the air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing down at us as we cut-- \n[6]I got him. \n[7]I'm ready.     9. \n[8]Not this time, Sparky. \n[9]Yeah... Just ahead, the ghost of his brother's car launches up the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the past. \n[10].who are you? \n[11].oh .yeah. He stares at her for a minute, powder-puffs of clouds floating about her head. \n[12]He, would you like to see my car \n[13]Hey, Rex. Hey Pops. \n[14]Her name's Trixie. She's in my class. \n[15]Hey pops, a guy wanted me to give this to you. He said he was a big fan. He hands him the package and Pops smiles. \n[16]He was in a hurry. Driving a '68 Fendersin. Sweet set. of wheels. The car description rings a bell for Rex. \n[17]When are you coming back? \n[18]I won't. He hugs his little brother, knowing it might be for the last time.     17. \n[19].I'm up, I'm up. \n[20].in spirit anyway. \n[21]Really? He sits, grabbing the paper. \n[22].really? Speed starts to read and suddenly the room begins to rumble, glasses shaking, plates rattling. \n[23]Driver's only as good as the car. \n[24]You're welcome, I guess. \n[25]Well, excuse me for asking, but what do you want? \n[26]What's this? \n[27]Don't bother. He's never wrong. They pass out of the museum. \n[28]I get that. \n[29]Honor to meet you. \n[30]Wow, thanks. \n[31]It's pretty impressive. \n[32].okay. He heads to the bathroom. Taking Mom by the elbow, Remmington gestures to the sitting area over-looking Cosmopolis. \n[33]Yeah? \n[34]Thanks, Mr. Remmington. \n[35]It's very... impressive. Remmington smiles. \n[36]I guess I'd like to think about it, if I .could. has really Remmington's a fisherman not sure if the hook been set. \n[37]I understand that, sir... He looks to Pops then takes a deep breath as though trying to find his resolve. \n[38]So if I had to give an answer now then, to be honest-- \n[39]Deal. \n[40]Looks like someone's in trouble again. \n[41]Want to talk about it? Sprittle shakes his head. \n[42]Was it that Stanton kid again? Did he say something? If you want to kick his butt--? He shakes his head again. \n[43]It's not fair. But that's what bullies do. They make the world unfair. \n[44]Yes, it does. \n[45]You ignore 'em when you can, fight 'em when you can't. \n[46]Yeah, but just try to keep one thing in mind. \n[47]Bullies come and go but a family can torture you forever. Chim-chim gives Sprittle a wet-willy. \n[48]But no joke, you just say the word, little brother and we got your back, right Chim-chim? Chim-chim grunts. \n[49]I just said it was tempting. \n[50]Well, they got a really good team.. Cannonball Taylor, Markie Manifold. They win a lot of Majors. \n[51]It is important. You gotta win if you want to keep driving and that's what I want to do. It's the only thing I really know how to do. When I'm driving, I feel like that's the only time my life makes sense. She moves closer to him. \n[52]Okay, besides being with you.     53. \n[53]You know I do. \n[54]What? \n[55]Come on, you know how I've felt about you since I was ten years old. \n[56]What do you want me to do? Kiss you in front of everyone at the end of a big race? \n[57]I don't know. Maybe we should practice first. \n[58]No!     54. \n[59]He did not! He throws open the trunk, revealing Sprittle and Chim-chim who shrieks. \n[60]Sprittle! \n[61]Oh no? \n[62]I'm taking you home. \n[63]Pops. \n[64]It could be for you too. \n[65]Thanks, Pops. The room begins to shake. \n[66]No... I'm okay. \n[67]I have, yes sir. \n[68].my family means a lot to me. \n[69]This isn't an easy decision for me, Mr. Remmington. For my family, racing is everything. We eat, drink, think and breathe racing. There is nothing more perfect than a picnic at Thunderhead. I mean, I was taught to drive before I could walk. But when my brother died, all that went away. I can't tell you how painful that was. It nearly killed all of us. Especially Pops. He didn't set foot in his shop for over a year. As the memory comes to life, we see the images in flashback.     59. \n[70]But one night when I was still pretty young. I couldn't sleep and I went into the living room and there was Pops, in his beat up robe, watching some old race recordings. The blue tv light of Speed's memory fills his eyes. \n[71]So I sat with him watching of Ben Burns coming round the last turn of he '43 Prix and all of a sudden Pops started screaming, and then I started screaming, and as Burns and Dugazi duked it out, heading for the finish, we were cheering our heads off and the second the black and white came down, we looked at each other and right there we realized the naked truth; racing is in our blood. Flashback ends. \n[72]But for Pops, it isn't just a sport. It's way more important than that. It's like a religion and in our house, the Major Sponsors are kinda like the devil. The coldness in Remmington's eyes belies his smile. \n[73]I don't mean to offend you sir and I do appreciate your offer, it's just, I guess I understand his -point of view and after all we've been through, I don't think this kind of deal is for me. Remmington chuckles. \n[74]If that's your idea of racing, you can keep it. \n[75]I can't! I can't move! The two cars head toward the final jump, locked in some strange embrace-- They lunge awkwardly, crashing on top of one another as-- Inside Speed's car, his face plate seals and the kwiksave- foam explodes, swallowing him, as the car tumbles-- Disintegrating into a cloud of smoke and glittering debris.     67. \n[76]That's ridiculous! \n[77]Pops was right. You are the devil. The elevator suddenly opens with the security goon carrying Sprittle and Chim-chim by the scruff of their necks. \n[78]Sprittle? \n[79]I'll see you at Fuji. Speed turns and heads for the elevator. \n[80]This is exactly what he said would happen if I didn't drive for him. \n[81]He said it'd get worse and worse and by the end of the year you'd be filing for bankruptcy, Pops. \n[82]How? What can we do? How can we fight this? He tosses the newspaper. \n[83]The truth? Don't be naive, Pops. He leaves. \n[84].I don't know. She comes in and sits beside him, putting her arm around him. \n[85]I don't know, mom. I might have really messed things up. \n[86]By not joining Remmington.     71. \n[87]But maybe racing isn't about being happy. Maybe Remmington's right and it's all about business and anyone who doesn't understand that is just a chump. \n[88].I loved that old wagon. \n[89]And I turned it over. \n[90]Rex told me the only reason we survived was because I was wearing red socks. \n[91]Why? \n[92]What do you want with me? \n[93]Of course. \n[94]How?     76. \n[95]But there aren't any more races left except for the Grand Prix and we both failed to qualify. Inspector takes a big breath. \n[96]And the way he was looking at me, I don't know...I just gotta do something. \n[97]He won't if I ask him. \n[98]You weren't in Remmington's office, Trix. You don't know what it was like. It felt as though he had his hand inside my chest and he was trying to crush everything in my life that mattered to me. \n[99]No joke, Trix. If you could have been in that room, you'd want to do anything you could to take this guy down. She looks straight into his eyes and he doesn't have to say anything else. \n[100]What? No way!     78. \n[101]Trixie, this isn't a game. These people play rough. \n[102]You would, wouldn't you? He looks into her eyes and knows the answer. \n[103]Well...I guess we're going skiing. She smiles. \n[104]I'm not doing this to help C.I.B. I don't know anything about corporate crimes and honestly, if I did, it wouldn't really matter.      82. \n[105]I'm doing this because someone is trying to hurt my family and I'm going to do everything I can to hurt him back. The masked racer is unable to mask his smile. \n[106]Nice to meet ya. She purrs in response. Racer X nods and she uses the computer to illustrate her modifications. \n[107]I understand it now, Trix. I know why he left us. She looks at him. \n[108]He was trying to change this rotten business and they killed him for it. \n[109]If they're so desperate, why not just use some kind of sniper? There's a million places someone could hide if they were really trying to kill you. \n[110]Why? \n[111]Here ya go! Speed leads an attack straight into Racer X's counter. \n[112]Flying in!     93. \n[113]He's got me! I'm locked up! Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved blade begins stabbing at Speed's tires. Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected. Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start gliding through the grappler. \n[114]I'm trying! The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the grappler is cut-- Speed flips away free, hitting the \"C\" button causing a new tire to inflate while he's upside down-- Landing on a new tire, without missing a beat. Tyrus rushes into the opening, but this time it's Katsue who works a hidden lever and-- A Katana-like blade flashes, a samurai slash across the front tire-- Bowing it out, flipping the entire car, which tumbles back straight at Speed, forcing him to try a split-jack \n[115]Relax. Snake's weak on turns. We'll catch him in the mountains. \n[116]Hey, all I was doing was saving your ass. Katsu raises a fist, but Racer X catches it.     97. \n[117]Racer X-- He stops. \n[118]I thought we made a good team today. It felt like we'd been doing it for a long time. He hesitates. \n[119]It was very weird, Trix. I knew every move he was going to make and he knew mine. It was so familiar. Maybe I'm crazy but Racer X first showed up two years after Rex's death. \n[120]A body was cremated. Remember it had already been badly burned in the crash. Even if it was Rex, no one could have recognized him.     99 \n[121]Somehow the kwik-save was disconnected. Inspector Detector suspected foul play but nothing could be proved. \n[122]I don't know. Maybe the same reason I'm here. Ding dong. Speed goes to the door. \n[123]Yeah... \n[124]That's all I've been thinking about, Pops. You, Mom, Sprittle, Sparky. Chim-chim shouts. \n[125]Yeah, you too, Chim-chim. We are in serious trouble,,Pops, and it's all my fault. \n[126]Why not? \n[127]You don't know that. \n[128]Maybe not. But it's the only thing I know how to do and I gotta do something. \n[129]I can't. I'm sorry, Pops. \n[130]I'm staying.     101. \n[131]I'm not a child, Pops. You can't tell me how to live my life. If you want to fire me as your driver, then fine, do it. But it won't change the fact that I am going to.finish this race. Pops looks ready to have an aneurism. \n[132]Don't take it out on me because you feel guilty for what happened to Rex. \n[133]Logged with security. \n[134]Some defensive modifications.     102 \n[135]It pulls left, rides a little stiff. \n[136]I'm sorry, Mom. \n[137]I know. It's gonna be okay. \n[138]Never again. She hugs him.. \n[139]Horuko? Are you all right? \n[140]What are we going to do? They all look to each other for an answer, but no one seems to have one. \n[141]Watch your line! Okamoto adjusts. \n[142]Cut left! Now! Speed. flies into block for Okamoto, but Okamoto doesn't create enough space. \n[143]Watch it! They kiss with the shriek of crashing metal. \n[144]This is completely-- \n[145]Left! Drift tight! Tight! Okamoto looks like he's about to go over the edge.     110. \n[146]No! \n[147]If you'd been a little more careful, he wouldn't be ahead of us. \n[148]I can't believe you talked us into this ridiculous idea. \n[149]Now's not the time to prove it! \n[150]It's too dangerous!     112. \n[151]With pleasure. Speed slingshots from the back position, hurling alongside the HydroCell team until-- Snake blocks him, setting up an attack by one of his team but this just allows Racer X a hole to punch through. The cars continue to slug it out still weaving up the mountain road, climbing it seems to helicopter or blimp height. \n[152]Trix? You all right? She's obviously shaken up. \n[153]I told you-- She turns ready to fight, if that's what he wants. \n[154]You are one helluva driver. She smiles. \n[155]Let's go! They start to turn until machine gun fires objects. \n[156]Sprittle this isn't a game. You could've been killed in there. \n[157]Chim-chim? \n[158]Sorry. \n[159]I'm fine. Ahead, the HydroCell team grows from small silhouettes flashing in and out of sight,. closer and closer, larger and larger until-- once more the three chase cars lock onto their rear bumper. \n[160]Double S. \n[161]Hi. Remember me? Speed roars up after him and Snake grabs for his lever again but now it's Speed that's ready-- Jumping over the ice, he body slams Snake, sending him hard into the rail as Speed shoots into the lead. \n[162]Uh, no. This was... a mutually beneficial opportunity. \n[163]X? Racer X? There is a small movement in the car, a shuddering as though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too far. \n[164]Racer X?!! He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes the masked man is not in pan; he is laughing. He practically falls out of his car. \n[165]What are you doing here? \n[166]Why? \n[167]Why would you care? \n[168]Why don't you just tell me the truth? Racer X stares at him hard. \n[169]You're Rex, aren't you? \n[170]Youfirstappeared two years after Rexdied.You drive just like him.Youknew I'd be here because thisis where he always used to takeme.Just tell me the truth. mask. After a long hard moment, Racer X pulls off his He is not Rex. Speed is stunned. \n[171]You're... not Rex. \n[172]I'm sorry. \n[173]For what? Making the same mistakes he did?     131. \n[174]And what good did it do? He got killed for nothing. Racing hasn't changed and it never will! \n[175]I don't know why I'm doing it anymore. \n[176]If you know so much, why don't you tell me why I should keep driving? \n[177]What's it look like? \n[178]I don't know. I just gotta get away from here. \n[179]Because. \n[180]Because I have to. \n[181]What? \n[182]No. \n[183]You'll understand when it's your turn. He shoulders his bag and shoves out the door. \n[184]Don't try to stop me. \n[185]Thanks. \n[186]So? It didn't amount to anything. It was completely meaningless. \n[187]I love you Pops. I'm just so confused right now. I don't what I'm doing or why I'm doing it. I'm locked up in some kinda tailspin and no direction makes sense. \n[188]Jeez Pops. That's just it. That's part of my problem. \n[189]That race. The '43 Prix. Burns and Dugazi? It was fixed. Remmington told me the whole story. It was all about some DNF names Rotts. They've known the winner of every Grand Prix for the past 50 years. It's always fixed. That's a tough pill for Pops to swallow. \n[190]I don't think he was lying, Pops. \n[191]Horuko?! \n[192]Yeah, sure. Come on in. She steps in, looking somewhat out of place in the suburban living room. \n[193]It's fine. Just another lesson learned. \n[194]An invitation to compete in the 91st annual Grand Prix? \n[195]\n[196]I don't believe it. You were listening the whole time? Trixie goes to him. \n[197]Goodbye and thank you. He closes the door. \n[198]Sparks, it's getting late. \n[199]Sounds beefy Pops. \n[200]Let's get it loaded! \n[201]I was on the Okamoto team remember? I won it fair and square. \n[202]Doubt it. \n[203]Oh no... \n[204]The Gray Ghost... \n[205]A million dollars? Wow. Maybe I should take myself out. \n[206]Why aren't you after the bounty? \n[207]Oh, yeah. \n[208]I just... I got this thing... its stupid, I know, a superstition, but I guess all of us got one.     147. \n[209].it's big. \n[210]Right. \n[211]Couldn't have gotten here without you. He hugs him.     149. \n[212]Me too. Speed climbs in as the speaker system blares-- \n[213]Ok Mr. Two Time Grand Prix, Five time WRL, future Hall of Fame, teach me something. \n[214]Come on! Is that it? He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it is immediately clear who is the better driver, as-- Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the other. \n[215]Lesson's over. See you at the finish line. Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does--     154. \n[216]No! \n[217]Spear hook! He's got me! Cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall, grinding against the Mach 5 while the trailing cars shoot post. \n[218]What do you need? Something makes him put the car in second gear. He steps on the accelerator, then hits the starter and--- And the Mach 5 roars to life. The crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber. ", "REMMINGTON": "\n[1]Mr. Racer, I have been an ardent admirer of your work for years. I remember the first time I saw the prototype for the Mach-1, I told everyone that it didn't belong on a race track, it belonged in an art museum. Pops chuckles. \n[2]No, sir. She was a revelation. He suddenly smells the pancakes.     27. \n[3]Oh, dear. I interrupted your breakfast. Is that pancakes, I smell? \n[4]A figure like mine requires constant attention, Mrs. Racer. \n[5]When I was a child we used to say, \"pankuken zin liesben.\" Neither of them speak German. \n[6]Pancakes are love. \n[7]Gorgeous, Mrs. Racer. Superb density. Hints of vanilla. Cinnamon. Absolutely gorgeous. \n[8]Like them? I want to-buy your recipe. He takes out his hand held computer and beings making notes. \n[9]Nonsense. Cenestro Foods, a sub- division of Remmington Industries is planning a new range of home- cooked meals for travelers and this is just the kind of magic we're looking for. I'll have my attorney draw up the paperwork. Mom looks at Pops feeling flattered but again a distinct discomfort. \n[10]Now, then. We all know the reason I'm here is because of you, Speed. I was watching last night and I have to tell you young man, you gave me goosebumps. I know at once, this was no mere driver I was watching. This was an artist. Speed's ears go a bit red. \n[11]I appreciate modesty, Speed but I do not exaggerate when is ay that you are a genius. Watching you reminded me of why I love racing and I am grateful for that. Thank you. \n[12]I imagine the phone has been ringing off the hook. \n[13]Is this your manager then? \n[14]Nice to meet you, youngster.     29. \n[15]Excellent. The first thing I want to make perfectly clear is that I have no intention whatsoever of trying to get Speed away from Racer motors. What you have here is what teams spend years and millions of dollars trying to achieve: chemistry. Car designer, mechanic and driver all coming together in perfect, harmony. I wouldn't dare touch a thing. \n[16]To help. I want to make sure you have access to whatever resources you need to continue doing exactly what you are doing. \n[17]I like when my partners have a sense of humor. And that's what I'm talking about. A partnership. An alliance between your amazing family and mine. That's exactly what Remmington Industries is to me, a family. Like yours. Just a little bigger. Pops isn't exactly buying it. \n[18]None taken. I completely understand. I sympathize.      30. \n[19]Strike that-- I sympathize. You may think of R. I. As a huge corporate conglomerate but I will have you know sire, that I still remember working all night on a Commodore 64 in the basement of my foster parents' home. I build R.I. From below the ground up. So while Remmington Industries may look like a Major Sponsor to you, it remains in my heart as independent to me as the first day I quit my job at GloBocom to work for myself. They're 're stunned into silence, while Remmington presses on. \n[20]Now I've had this wonderful opportunity to meet your family. All I am asking is for you to please give me the chance to introduce you to.mine. \n[21]Special permit. Only six of them are granted a year.     31. \n[22]No doubt in my mind; young man. Given the right circumstances, I have no doubt whatsoever.     32. \n[23]This is Gennie. She's our Talent Manager. Ask for anything, her job's to make it come true. \n[24]To make an informed decision you'll need to understand how we take care of our drivers. The tailor finishes quickly as an electric cart, the kind designed for a group tour pulls up. \n[25]All abroad. \n[26]Remmington Tower is the crown jewel among the properties that I control. It functions as the corporate headquarters for he top twelve divisions of our parent corp. One big industries family. The turn a corner heading for a large set of doors with the double \"R\" logo of Remmington Racecars. \n[27]Of all the 143 companies that I control, none of them is as dear to my heart as the T-180 division. The door opens as they enter--- \n[28]I've always felt that it is impossible to peer into the window of Tomorrow without a clear view of the Past. \n[29]This is our operating theater where our patented Refusion Energy Distributor Network is installed in the turbine drive. Sparky's eye light up. \n[30]It is indeed. Sparky shoots a look at Pops. \n[31]We control the only transponder foundry in the world outside of Mushi Motors in Taiobi. The window suddenly turns into a mirror. \n[32]Oops. Sorry. Trade Secrets. \n[33]Now, I'll take you up to the Team Remmington training facility. The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first one, decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up- graded lights. The higher you go in the Remmington Tower, the nicer the halls are decorated. \n[34]As you know, a T-180 driver's got to be in peak physical condition. Across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver. She is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to her while several doctors not their approval at the read- outs. \n[35]No expense is spared to make sure that when our driver's suit up they are as perfectly tuned as the machines they are controlling. The next window is a massive centrifuge; a huge mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that blasts past the window. \n[36]The best driver must be able to withstand over 4-Gs of force in a typical race.     37. \n[37]I hope I didn't care you, Speed with how hard we push our team. I just wanted you to see how serious we are committed to winning. \n[38]Good. But also understand that R.I. Isn't all work and no play. The door opens revealing the Drivers' Club. \n[39]Stop the cart. Jack! Jack, come here. There's someone I want you to meet. Cannonball saunters over, wearing his two goiter-sized, diamond-encrusted champion rings. \n[40]Speed Racer allow me to introduce two-time Grand Prix Winner, five time WRL Champion and future Hall of Famer, Jack Cannonball Taylor. \n[41]Thanks, Jack. Jack nods and the cart pulls away but not before Jack shoots a backward glance at Speed that feels like a shank in a prison yard.     39. \n[42]We treat our thoroughbreds the way they deserve to be treated. He guides them into the room gesturing or demonstrating all of the amenities. \n[43]There's full maid service of course with a personal chef and a masseuse available 24/7. The staff arrives, wheeling in several racks of clothes: daywear, sportswear, racing uniforms and stylish evening wear. Gennie holds up one of the suit to Speed. \n[44]So Mrs. Racer, what do you think about my family? Impressed? \n[45]Good. I want you to understand the possibilities that exist for your son right now. Pops furrows his brow. \n[46]What's wrong Mr. Racer? \n[47]Very sharp, Speed. Suits you perfectly. Regardless of what happens, I want you to have all of it. A gift.     41. \n[48]So, how are you feeling Speed? Speed isn't sure. He looks at Trixie and Sparky and then at his parents. \n[49]You think that maybe there's something that could work out here? Everyone waits, staring at him. \n[50]This isn't the kind of offer I go around making ever day, son. \n[51]Stop. Right there. You're right. You should think about it. I'm sure you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. You should take a little time. Think about what you saw and heard here and we'll get together early next week. Deal? He reaches his hand out and Speed takes it with some obvious relief.     42. \n[52]The new GRX has a super charged inner-positive transporter and will be capable of speeds in excess off 800 kilometers an hour. \n[53]One would expect. \n[54]You know what I want and I know that for the last few years you have been trying to buy out your main rival Tetsua Okamoto. The question is, can we make a deal? The car rotates, rising up on its mechanical arm, a cybernetic giant, exercising its might.     52. \n[55]Done. Remington smiles as they shake hands. \n[56]Speed! Gennie leaves speed, returning to the elevator, as Remmington crosses to him. He hugs him \n[57]Welcome back! Come. Sit. Sit.     57. \n[58]Can I get you something to drink? Water? Bubbly? A shot of rye? Speed smiles sheepishly. \n[59]So, I can see you have given some serious thought to this thing. \n[60]Good. That means that you understand that we are talking about not just your future, but your family's future. \n[61]I know. I can tell. That's why this is so important. Because you can help them. All you have to say is yes. That is all I need to hear and I can make so many things happen for you, and your family. Are you ready for that? Are you ready to say yes, Speed? \n[62]You poor, naive, chump. He chuckles again.     60. \n[63]I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that load of sickening schmaltz and I am going to give you a bit of an education. At the end of it if you're smart, you'll thank me and hen you'll sign that contract. \n[64]Look. There is the true spirit of the golden age of racing. Benjamin Braddack, Diamond Dave Tweksbury, Reginald White, Oliver Potter, and George Wheeler. The five most powerful men in the world at the turn of the last century. As he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and photographs of the golden era. \n[65]For all intensive purposes they created the modern automotive industry. But the true stroke of their genius was the invention of the WRL, the world's first racing league. Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos including the first motor of his first car, the first milk bottle from victory lane,.a black and white from an important race. In front of an enlarged picture of Ben Burns from the infamous '43 Prix is a twisted and scorched piece of metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of art.     61. \n[66]Interesting that you and your father were so moved by the '43 Prix. One of the great finishes in the history of racing, right? Everyone remembers Burns and Dugazi slugging it out, but who remembers Carl Potts? Driving a rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne . Industries, Potts spun out in the second lap and went down as a DNF. A forgettable and pathetic finish. So bad, that afterwards Iodyne stock dropped six points. Again we see the history told in flashback. \n[67]Meanwhile, Ben Burns sat guzzling cold fresh milk in victory lane, a thousand cameras taking his picture, Sirrus Aeronautics saw almost a twelve point gain which immediately block Penninsula Power Cell from being able to afford the price of a complete take-over. This put Joel Goldman, the CEO of Iodyne Inc. in the exact position he wanted to be in. By first buying controlling interest in his own company at a devalued price, he then brokered a merger with Sirrus that immediately sent Iodyne into the gains record book-- the only record book that matters. Look out that window, there isn't a single plane or helicopter or K- Harrier that isn't powered by Iodyne fuel cells. That's what racing is about. It has nothing to do with cars, or drivers. All that matters is power and the unassailable might of money. His greed is as tangible as any drug. \n[68]Do you understand? Burns knew he was going to win. It was already decided. A week before the Prix, Goldman and Sirrus met with several other major players at the Carlyle Hotel. They met there as they had for years, just as their fathers had met, and as their sons and heirs will still meet. They met to negotiate the finish order of the Grand Prix. No race is more important and no race is more controlled. That year Goldman was supposed to win, but he knew if he sold his win to Sirrus, whatever that win might be worth, was nothing compared to what could be gained. He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal. \n[69]That's why I paid three million dollars for this burnt and twisted piece of metal. Because it reminds me of what really matters. This is the true heart of racing boy! This is my religion! Speed is aghast. \n[70]You don't know how many times I have seen that same cow-eyed \"say it isn't so\" look of disbelief. Every bumpkin who comes in from the sticks looks exactly like you do now. I won't bother proving it to you.     63. \n[71]If you walk away from me, if you walk out of.this deal, you'll know how true it is soon enough. So, last chance. What's it going to be, Speed? Your father's little fantasy bubble? Or are you going to join the rest of us adults, here in reality? \n[72]What's this? He looks and sees the shoes and suit. \n[73]Listen to me and listen good kid, because I'm going to give you one more history lesson. You're going to go to Fuji-- In quick, collage cuts we see --     64. \n[74]But you won't win. You won't place. More collage cuts-- \n[75]Soon after that there will be litigation against some of your father's designs. \n[76]The legitimacy of the lawsuits won't matter. They will be enough to discredit his company. Whatever contracts he has, he'll lose. Within a year he will be filing for bankruptcy. After that, you and the rest of your pathetic family will be history. The threat hangs in the air like a loaded gun between them. \n[77]As I'm sure you're aware, the Okamoto stock fell another four points yesterday. In the next few days it will hit bottom and they will have to sell. The car roars through its elliptical path like a circling electron binding the two tycoons together. \n[78]Mushi won't do too badly either. Mushi nods. Cannonball circles, everything in apparent harmony until Gennie leans in and whispers. \n[79]Who? \n[80]Ineptitude? Is this what I pay you for? \n[81]If. they do, I assure you it will be a very costly mistake for everyone. He hangs up.     98. \n[82]Mr. Mushi-- \n[83]I understand there is a problem, but I assure you there is no need to panic. \n[84]Perhaps your definition of \"solved\" is different from mine. \n[85]Get me... Tetsuya Okamoto. \n[86]Congratulations Mr. Okamoto. Very impressive race. \n[87]That's outrageous! The price is barely above 50! This is extortion! Blackmail! I'll sue you! Tie up every asset you own up for the next 20 years! \n[88]Wait! He grinds his molars until they are smooth. \n[89]Seventy-eight a share. I'll have the papers drawn up. \n[90]I swear to you Mr. Mushi when the GRX is revealed at the Grand Prix and then captures the black and white checkers the demand for our transponder engines will go through the roof. Mushi.smiles.     139. \n[91]Ladies and gentlemen, behold the future. It's black, shiny, and beautiful in a malefic way. \n[92]What madness is going on here?     143. \n[93]Where did you get that? \n[94]This is preposterous! He can't be allowed to race. It's too late. \n[95]What?! Do you have any idea what that would cost? Are you insane? \n[96]You'll regret this. \n[97]A million dollars to the driver that takes Racer out. \n[98]I prefer him to not even make it out of the locker room. Cannonball smiles as Remmington starts to turn. \n[99]We're installing a spear hook on the GRX. \n[100]A precaution.     145. \n[101]Do it. Stop him. Stop him now. \n[102]Stop him! Stop him!     159. ", "POPS": "\n[1]Quiet, Speed! There's a lotta race to run. \n[2]Sssh! \n[3]Who's your friend? \n[4]Pleasure to meet you, young lady. \n[5]A fan, is it? Not often we get someone with such good taste around here. Where is he?     15. \n[6]So, you're quitting? \n[7]No you don't. This is a choice. You're selling out, walking away from everything we've built here. \n[8]Don't you walk away from me! \n[9]If you walk out that door, you better not ever come back! The door slams in response. \n[10]Turn it off, Speed! I don't want you watching this anymore. \n[11]\"It was a virtuoso display of talent, the likes of which has not been seen at Thunderhead since Racer the elder dropped jaws eight. years ago. Now, as we once again, pull our collective jaws up from the floor, we have to ask, will it be different this time, or will \n[12]That's because the Sponsors run the media, Sparky. Trixie enters through the back door. \n[13]What the--? \n[14]Sprittle calm down! \n[15]Uh, thanks but... who are you? He seems to rise up an inch taller as he introduces himself. \n[16]Yeah, she was a beaut. \n[17]I assume, Mr. Remmington that you are not talking about philanthropy. Remmington chuckles. \n[18]No offense, Remmington but Racer Motors runs as an independent. \n[19]Sprittle! \n[20]What do you say? \n[21]To be honest, Remmington, I'm feeling more intimidated than impressed. This kind of company scares me. People like you have way too much money and when someone has this kind of money, they start thinking that the rules everyone else is playing by don't mean squat to them. Remmington remains skillfully unfazed. \n[22]However, my sons are the most important thing I've ever done in my life, besides marrying my best friend and if Speed wants us to figure out some kind of... \"alliance\" then you can bet your ass we'll be in business. Speed steps out of the bathroom. His boyishness has faded away as he suddenly seems very much a man. Gennie smile approvingly. \n[23]Morning, Speed. \n[24]So, today's the big day. Speed nods. Pops puts down his tools. \n[25]I know this is a tremendous opportunity for you. \n[26]Could be, could be. But, regardless, this is really all about you. It' your decision and I want you to know, no matter what you decide, I'm behind you. \n[27]I think your ride's here. \n[28]Yeah, but I'm still on vacation- \n[29]What? \n[30]You'll do no such thing. \n[31]He was just trying to scare you, son. They tried the same thing with Rex. If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get. \n[32]The truth will come out. \n[33]What are you two squawking about? They dive behind the couch but peek out as Pops heads for the door. \n[34]Inspector Detector? \n[35]Ten years. \n[36],Why help him? \n[37]What?! \n[38]Absolutely out of the question. \n[39]No! Rally racing is a back alley sport full of jackals, head- hunters and thugs! I'm sorry, Inspector but I lost one son to that death-trap. I won't lose another. \n[40]Keep your card, Chief Inspector.     77. \n[41]Sprittle! Faster than a blink Sprittle grabs the remote and changes the channel to \"Unser Charly,\" a German sitcom starring a monkey. \n[42]What are you doing? \n[43]It's in German! \n[44]Oh no you don't. You are not watching that race. Out you go. Outside. Get some exercise. You're too pale.     86. \n[45]I've got to go into town for some parts. I'll be back for lunch. \n[46]Honey, I can't find my wallet---- Pops enters the room expecting to find Mom but catches them red-handed. \n[47]Sprittle! He sees the race on tv. \n[48]You two are in-- \n[49]I'm not falling for that-- \n[50]Speed's skiing. \n[51]Oh no. \n[52]Is this the kind of driver I have? Someone who disobeys? Someone who lies to me? Is this the kind of son I have raised? And you, Trixie, you know what this race did to this family. Did either of you stop to think about us? Huh? Speed, did you think about your mother? Or your brother?      100 \n[53]What it would do if something happened to you? \n[54]This is not the place or the race to do anything about that. \n[55]Because it won't do any good? \n[56]You think you can drive a car and change the world?! It doesn't work like that! \n[57]That's unacceptable! This is over. Pack your things. We're going home. Speed has never directly disobeyed his father. \n[58]What?! \n[59]No you're not! You're coming home, right now! \n[60]God, you sound like Rex. Do you want to die like him too? Will that make you happy? \n[61]Where's the Mach-5? \n[62]You added something to it? \n[63]The whole thing's out of balance, isn't it? \n[64]Sparky. Pops and Sparky leave to do their work. Speed feels terrible. He looks at his Mom. \n[65]You attack my family?1 You try to hurt my son?! Pops twists the squirming ninja through a series of wrestling moves-- Finishing the ninja in a spinning over head helicopter----     105. \n[66]More like a non-ja. Terrible what passes for a ninja these days. s still She looks out the window and smiles; this family' got it. \n[67]I'll get it. It is Horuko, surrounded by security. \n[68]Absolutely crazy. \n[69].that's my boy. \n[70]Checked it this morning. Quite a few dead spots in these mountains. \n[71]What is this?! \n[72]Sprittle?! \n[73]Sprittlel Get over here! \n[74]Oh no, you're not getting off that easy. If your mother hasn't had a heart attack already, I'm sure she'll know what to do with you two. tires and The last of Pops line is lost to the squeal of roar of engines as the HydroCell team flies by.     120. \n[75]Speed, before you go, I'd like to say a few things. Will you sit with your old man for a minute? Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag. \n[76]I won't. I made a mistake trying to tell you what to do at Cortega. You were right. I was wrong. I won't make that mistake again. Speed sits. \n[77]I want you to know that I acted rashly. I said things I wish I hadn't. Your mother usually protects me from making an ass out of my self but I was determined to do it this time and I guess I did a pretty good job of it. I wanted to make sure you understood how sorry I was. \n[78]The truth was, I couldn't have been more proud of you son. Not because you won, but because you stood up, you weren't afraid and you did what you thought was right. \n[79]How could it be meaningless? I saw my son become a man. I watched him act with courage and integrity and drive the pants off of every driver on the road. This is not meaningless. This is the reason for a father's life. Pop's eyes'begin to twinkle with tears     134. \n[80]I admit I went to Cortega because I was afraid that what happened to Rex was going to happen to you. And I just couldn't take that. I couldn't loose another one of my boys like that again. But what I realize in Cortega was that I didn't lose Rex when he crashed, I lost him here. I lost him when he walked out of this house and I let him go without telling him how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. I let him think that a stupid motor company meant more to me than he did. You'll never know how much I regret that mistake, but it's enough that I'll never make it again. He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him. \n[81]I love you Speed. I understand that every child leaves home but I want you to know that door is always open and you can always come back. \n[82]I know what that's like. When Rex died I didn't even. know if I wanted salt on my eggs, let alone if I wanted to keep building cars. Then, do you remember when we sat here, that night, watching old Ben Burns and Dugazi? You remember that? Speednods vaguely. \n[83]Sittin' here, cheering with you, something just clicked, like a light being switched on inside of me and after that, I never had trouble remembering how I liked me eggs.     135. \n[84]What? \n[85]I don't believe that. Remmington's a crook. You can't believe a crook. \n[86]The Grand Prix? A sham? Ding dong. \n[87]Who could that be? \n[88]You going to ask the lovely lady in?     136. \n[89]Can I get you something to drink? \n[90]Whaddya think of that, Mr. Its- Always-Fixed? \n[91]We don't have a car. Sparky! \n[92]What're you doing in the kitchen? \n[93]Come on! We got work to do.     138. \n[94]Isn't that how fast Remmington said he could build that tin can with all his fancy machines? \n[95]Then we'll do it in 32. Let's go! He heads for the garage, Sprittle leaping after him. \n[96]Well come on. \n[97]We need everyone. \n[98]It gives you a little something extra. \n[99]Sprittle, we don't know that. \n[100]Don't quit on us now baby. ", "SPRITTLE": "\n[1]Jeepers, he could do it, Pops. He could really do it, couldn't he? Pops goes back to his binos. \n[2]What if he does? What if he does it, Pops? \n[3]I don't know if I can watch this... He holds the binos as though afraid to look when-- A hairy hand comes in and takes them away. Chim-chim, sitting on the chair next to Sprittle, puts the binos to his eyes. Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing another cheer. Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young woman, standing on the other side of Pops, lowers her. Trixie chews at her lip, feeling a knot twist into her gut. \n[4]Come on, Let's go! Victory Lane! \n[5]Racer residence. \n[6]He's not interested. He hangs up. \n[7]Speed's gotta drive for Pops! \n[8]Hello? \n[9]Nope. He hangs up. Shrugs. \n[10]Wrong number. \n[11]Earthquake! He and Chim-chim begin wailing in panic. \n[12]Quick, under the table! Into the door-frame! \n[13]Speed's not interest in driving for you or any other sponsor. \n[14]We got out eye on you, Mister. \n[15]She said we could! Pop growls at him, his eyes telling them they'd better not take more than one piece. Hang-dogged heads, they each grab one piece of candy? \n[16]Thank you. She closes the drawer, their eyes seen through the racks, watching paradise disappear as though a mirage. \n[17]My brother's going to win the Grand Prix one day. Remmington's eyes glint. \n[18]Cool!. They climb on and the driver pulls into the tramway. \n[19]That's the Crystal Horse with the Apache Super--Charger! \n[20]No. Wrong. '72. '71 was the Vundervopper with the K-2 twin turbine and '73 was the Kenobe Motorstar re-built with a VC ;triple chamber. Remmington considers arguing. \n[21]That's Cannonball Taylor! Speed urns and sees the Captain of the Remmington Team.     38 \n[22]Sorry. Cheaters never prosper. The kid to the left chimes in.     49. \n[23]No, your mother does it for me. Malcom almost swallows his tongue as several other kids snicker.. \n[24]K-W Integral 4-door with twin-cam turbine...C-foster-K 1200, modified split-rail and supershocks...     50. \n[25].it doesn't seem fair that I get in trouble, when they always start it. \n[26]That sucks. \n[27]What can I do about it? \n[28]Those choices suck too. \n[29]What? \n[30]Heeeeeey! Speed laughs as Chim-chim howls and then puts his arm around Sprittle.     51. \n[31]Thanks guys. \n[32]Oh God! I'm gonna hurl! Huuuurrrl! \n[33]It wasn't my idea! \n[34]It was his! He points at Chim-chim who shakes his head wildly, pointing back at Sprittle. \n[35]No! Don't do that! We're sorry. We couldn't sleep. We just wanted to hang out. We didn't know you were going to In-spew-ration Point. By the way, Cootie-shots. Sprittle and Chim-chim immediately cover one shoulder giving themselves a cootie-shot. \n[36]Wait, wait, wait-- Speed slams\u00e2\u0080\u00a2the trunk shut so we hear Sprittle voice muffled \n[37]Can we stop for ice cream first? \n[38]Uh-oh. He looks back at their mess. \n[39]jig's up. A moment later the door opens and the cleaning man enters.. \n[40]Speed! \n[41]I'm going to send that guy some Chim-chim cookies. Chim-chim guffaws. \n[42]We gotta do something, Pops. Speed steps into the doorway. \n[43]Okay, he's definitely gettin' some monkey cookies. \n[44]\n[45]Pops, whatever you do, don't open the door! \n[46]What's he doing here? \n[47]Just watching a little TV, Pops. Pops looks at the TV suspiciously, then back at his son. \n[48]It's his favorite show. \n[49]Not the monkey parts. chim-chim smiles. \n[50]Sure thing Pops. Pops looks at them, shakes his head and walks off. \n[51]Let's go! They drop their mirrors and bolt for the house. \n[52]Wait! Pops, before you get mad at us--Look! Sprittle points at the tv eyes wide. \n[53]It's Speed! \n[54]Then who's driving the Mach 5? Pops turns and indeed, there's the Mach 5 barrelling across the red baked earth of Zunubia. \n[55]All right, room service! \n[56]Oh yeah! Pops can't help a flash of delight. \n[57]Monkey cookie! He turns just as-- Whap! A monkey cookie in the kisser. \n[58]Nice shot! Chim-chim howls as Sprittle reloads his sling-shot. \n[59]Ahhhh! He and Chim-chim run behind Speed. \n[60]I.know it was bad! I know we shouldn't have done it. But Chim- chim was really really scared. \n[61]Okay, I was a little scared too. \n[62]I didn't want what happened to Rex to happen to you. Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open. \n[63]We just thought if you got into trouble, maybe we could help and it's a good thing we did. a good Speed looks at Pops as if Sprittle is making point. \n[64]Go, Speed, go! \n[65]Hey watcha doin? \n[66]Where ya goin? \n[67]Why? \n[68]Because why? \n[69]Can we come with you? Speed is struck by an odd sense of deja vu. \n[70]Can we come with you? \n[71]Why? \n[72]I want to help. \n[73]Chim-chim too? \n[74]That cheater! He's using a spear hook! SPEAR HOOK! SPEAR HOOK! The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable. \n[75]I do! Cannonball Taylor is nothing but a big cheater!     155. \n[76]Told you so! Chim-chim high fives him. \n[77]Cheaters never prosper! \n[78]Danger. May cause cookies. Mom and Pops both hug Speed, their eyes bright with joy ", "RACER X": "\n[1]No. He's going to be the best. The crowd swarms around Speed's car. \n[2]If they don't destroy him first. \n[3]I didn't save anything worth saving unless you get smart. Real fast. Racer talks without looking at him. \n[4]You thought you could take on the Cartel. You can't. Not without help. \n[5]You won the Cortex Invitational and you weren't supposed to. You did it to save Okamoto Engineering. \n[6]And now someone else wants it. The only way you can stop it from happening is to talk to the authorities. \n[7]You have been on cruncher Block's leash for.so long maybe you forgot how it feels to stand up and be a man. The only way you'll ever stop these people is to bring them to justice. \n[8]Get out. Wearing his smirk like a cheap suit, Katsu gets out. \n[9]You won't finish. When you lose, if you can still dial a phone, call this number. He hands him a card. The card reads; CHIEF INSPECTOR \n[10]This is a bad idea. \n[11]We're going to need some insurance for this race. Minx clicks away at a keyboard while a digital Mach 5 rotates on a screen. \n[12]Minx builds my cars. \n[13]I got him. \n[14]Let's skip the niceties and cut to the chase. Katsuarches an eyebrow. \n[15]The only reason we're here is because you needed two outsiders and because the Chief Inspector believes you'll turn over your. file on Remmington and Block. Racer X eyes him. \n[16]I don't believe it. I don't trust anyone who needs this kind of deal before they'll bring a criminal to justice. The accusation hangs in the air. \n[17]But I'm willing to take a chance that you'll prove me wrong. \n[18]We'll see. Until then you have my word that I will do everything.I can to make sure you checker at Bartimaeus. Katsu smiles. \n[19]Any obvious crime would allow the Chief Inspector to shut the race down. That kind of scrutiny would only hurt the business. They'll do as much as they can to make it appear legit. Speed nods. \n[20]The real problem we'll have is after the: first leg. Corteges is going to be extremely dangerous. Take my advice, keep your family away from Cortega. Speed again looks out at Moruko on the balcony. \n[21]He's not alone. \n[22]This surprises me. \n[23]Tyrus is a good man. I wouldn't expect him to turn head-hunter. They aren't pulling any punches.     92. \n[24]Lead him-- \n[25]Wing left. \n[26]Get out of there! - \n[27]Don't fall apart yet. There's still a lot of race to run. Katsu jerks free of Racer X and storms towards the door immediately enveloped by his security team. Speed looks at Racer X as though he can suddenly see through the mask. \n[28]A C.I.B. Man will be posted outside your door. We got their attention today. You and Trixie should be very careful tonight. Speed nods as Racer X heads for the door. \n[29]If you say so. He turns away leaving Speed alone. \n[30]Narcolyte Benzamine. A highly effective and debilitating drug.      106. \n[31]Stays in the system for hours, but leaves with no trace. \n[32]No you won't. You can't drive a car. You can barely stand up. Katsu leaps to his feet. \n[33]Speed, you're too tight! The cars bounce and Speed takes a hit, spinning for moment before he regains control. Speed mumbles to himself. \n[34]Children, focus! If we're going to have a chance we're going to have to pass Snake before the rendezvous. \n[35]Take 'em. \n[36]Then let's move it. We got some time to eat up. \n[37]What's he doing here? \n[38]Do what he'd do; break his legs and let him walk back. Horuko bows to Trixie. \n[39]Looks like another change of plan.     119. \n[40]Are you all right? \n[41]The next cave's a rattler. \n[42]We'll make our move in there. \n[43]Now. The cars split apart, Racer X leading the charge as-- Sparks flash as with the cross of swords, metal striking metal and-- The ice-crusted walls sparkle with star-bursts of \n[44]Speed! \n[45]We did our part. Make sure you do yours. Racer X stares at Katsu whose face is as expressionless as a mask but it feels as though Racer X can see right through it. \n[46]Jeezus, kid. You can drive. I haven't been thrown like that in years. \n[47]The inspector told me what happened., I came looking for you. \n[48]Thought you'd take it hard and maybe do something stupid.     130. \n[49]Because you're a fighter. And a friend. \n[50]You mean your brother? \n[51]No. I'm sorry Speed but your brother is dead. He pulls his mask back on. \n[52]Don't be. I'm sure where ever your brother is, he is immensely proud of you. \n[53]For trying to make a difference. From what I've read, that's all he tried to do. \n[54]It doesn't matter if racing never changes. What matters is if we let racing change us. Everyone of us has to find the reason to do this. You don't climb into a T- 180 to be a driver. You do it because you're driven. \n[55]That's obvious. At Fuji, you were trying to prove something. At Cristo, you were looking for justice. Neither are the reason you belong behind a steering wheel. \n[56]Sorry. That's for you to figure out. He climbs back into his car. \n[57]I just hope when you do, I'm there. to see it. He roars away leaving Speed alone. \n[58]Speed Racer? Speed turns, taking a moment to realize the handsome millionaire playboy in the tux is unmasked Racer X. He glances down at Speed's belongings and sees a picture of Rex. \n[59]Careful. Listen to it. Don't kill the starter.     157. \n[60]It already has. \n[61]He turns and takes Minx by the arm. \n[62]If I did, then it's a mistake I have to live with.

Speed stumbles in the door. \n[9]Hey superstar, did you see the papers? They're all in love with you. \n[10]Mmm hmm! \n[11]Hubba hubba. He walks over to the sitting area. \n[12]You're really considering signing with Remmington. \n[13]Why? \n[14]Since when did winning become so important? \n[15]You mean, this doesn't make sense to you? \n[16]So you like being with me? \n[17]Sometimes I do, sometimes I'm not so sure. \n[18]Sometimes around your family, you seem distant, not like this and I wonder why. \n[19]I guess so, I just wish you weren't so shy about it. \n[20]Would that be so terrible? \n[21]Maybe we should. They start to kiss when they hear a muted voice. \n[22]Sprittle? \n[23]Wait till we tell Pops. \n[24]But Pops will never let you go. \n[25]Speed Racer what are you thinking? \n[26]I hate him. I'm picturing his heart clogging with cholesterol right now. \n[27]All right. Let's do it. You're going to need an alibi. We'll say we're going skiing. \n[28]You're going to need my help. Casa Cristo is a rally. I can spot from a 'copter. \n[29]I know. That's why I'm coming with you. And if you even try to argue with me, I'll tell Pops right now and he won't let you out of his sight. \n[30]Katsu, HydroCell's coming up on\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 your left. The HydroCell cars jostle their way towards Katsu, Speed and Racer X. \n[31]Speed, jump! \n[32]Speed! Wham! Billy slams up against him-- Throwing a lever, a grappler locks on to the Mach 5. \n[33]But Speed, Rex was cremated. \n[34]So you think he faked the crash with a different body in the driver's seat? \n[35]okay, let's say it's all true. Why would we do it? \n[36]So am \n[37]Oh my god? Was that a ninja? Pops cracks his knuckles. \n[38]Cool beans. There is a hurried knock at the door. \n[39]That's better. Couldn't see anything. She gains control and eases the car into the slot. \n[40]Well, let's go get him. \n[41]I told you I couldn't see outta this dang helmet. It's too big. \n[42]What's ridiculous about it? You're the one always telling me I'm a better driver than most of the WRL. \n[43]Why not? \n[44]Too dangerous for me but not for you? \n[45]I'm ready. Let's roll. She floors it, pulling out, leaving Speed shaking his head and trying to keep up. They smear through a hairpin turn and as they close on the nearest cars it is immediately apparent that they are no longer driving protectively or defensively-- They are attacking. Racer X leaps at the bumper of one car, corner-checking him into the rail while-- Trixie hits like a cue ball on the break, scattering several cars-- Leaving Speed little to clean up. \n[46]Yeah, sure. 10--4 and ready for more. Speed shakes his head, wanting this to be over. \n[47]You're not so bad yourself. Sparky and Pops go to work, changing fuel cells and starting to pound out some of the serious dents. Racer X sees Cruncher guarded by the security team. \n[48]It was a blast. \n[49]Scared of what? Sprittle clings to his big brother. \n[50]This is where Rex... Sparky nods.     121. \n[51]We were worried about you. \n[52]Look! There's Speed! \n[53]Speed!

When he hears the voice, he lifts his head and we see a huge man with a body like a cement-lined safe, sitting behind a desk, lighting a cigar. This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block. \n[2]I thought we were friends. He blows a cloud of smoke and watches it float up to the chandelier which is jiggling steadily. \n[3]Maybe where you come from, this is how you treat your friends, but 'round here we don't take to kindly to this kind of thing, do we fellas?

The water foams as the carnivorous fish shred flesh from bone. \n[8]How're my babies doing? Huh? Hungry? Ready for seconds? Boys! They grab Katsu and haul him to the fishtank. \n[9]You even think about turning rat and next time it's your sister going in there. \n[10]What?!     44. \n[11]is it him? \n[12]Can you see him yet? \n[13]Get him! Everyone leaps into action, shoving Katsu back into a chair. Filling their fists with guns, sliding open murder holes slots at a variety of heights. Cruncher barks into the phone. \n[14]Crush him! \n[15]Where is he? \n[16]Gotcha. He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car-- But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by, exploding further down the highway. Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris open and the barrels of several weapons extend out. \n[17]Aww, I thought you fixed that! The black car fires again, bullets ricocheting inside, puncturing a hole in the fish tank. \n[18]My babies! He runs to the fish tank and tries to stop the water pouring out of the hole. He sticks his finger in and the fish immediately attack. He shrieks withdrawing his finger. \n[19]Vinny put your finger in there! Vinny doesn't want to. \n[20]Do it! \n[21]Pull over but don't stop. \n[22]Yeah ...I wanna send someone a present. \n[23]Enough! I can't stand the whining! \n[24]It's simple.

The other two will quit.     88. \n[26]They ain't checkered yet. \n[27]Don't do it! They raise their hands. \n[28]On the ground! Now! They get on.the floor. Horuko stands and Cruncher whips his gun around to her. \n[29]\n[30]What the-- Katsu snatches Cruncher's gun and the Fixer is too stunned to do anything to stop it. \n[31]You-cheater. The security team seizes hold of him. \n[32]But if you're here, who's--? \n[33]Haven't ya heard? Cheaters never prosper. \n[34]This is called a change of plan. Now freed, one of the thugs tosses him a gun. \n[35]The new plan-- what was it, again? Break your legs, make you.walk back? I like that. He stands smiling in front of Racer X. \n[36]But first, I think it's time to play a little peek-a-boo, I-see- you. \n[37]\n[38]Get that monkey! The goons are confused, distracted, and before they can control it, the fight is on-- Racer X throws the thug holding him-- Speed and Trixie dish out equal measures of chop-socky and good of American slug-fu as-- Pops grapples and wrestles his goon into a head-lock. Racer X hammers Cruncher to the ground where he sees his gun, scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it-- Katsu steps on his hand.

You may wanna ease up-- \n[4]Holy canoli, Speed, You know who you're racing?     10. \n[5]I just can't believe there wasn't one mention of Racer motors in there. \n[6]Yeah, but there sure is a lot of speculation about which team's going to pick him up     25. \n[7]Hey, there's the Grand Prix Coliseum!

Behind him the entire family peeks out. \n[27]But Pops, the race is less than 36 hours away. \n[28]Yeah. \n[29]Alright, fire it up! Everyone holds their breath as Speed hits the ignition. The car makes a sick baying rattle and smoke begins pouring out of the engine. \n[30]Kill it! Kill it! \n[31]I know, I know. Okay. Give it a try. Everyone braces as Speed hits the ignition. It is the sound of an explosion held in the palm of your hand.     141. \n[32]Howya feelin'? Speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again. \n[33]Hey, this cockpit is the exact same size it was at Thunderhead. \n[34]Just wanted to say, thanks, for what could be the most exciting moment of my life. \n[35]I'm looking forward to that cold milk. \n[36]What is it? \n[37]Oh no, come on, don't do this.

What you do behind the wheel of a racecar has nothing to do with business. Before you could even talk, you were making noises that sounded like a car engine. We used to tell people you were speaking car-ese. We used to try to take you to the park but you never wanted to get out of the car. \n[25]And do you remember the time Rex took you out to Thunderhead and let you drive-- Speed smiles. \n[26]My heart still pounds just thinking about it. \n[27]I thought your father was going to have a stroke when you walked in the door with that crazy smile.     72. \n[28]I don't think I ever saw you as happy as you were telling anybody who asked, how you lost your two front teeth in your first crash. \n[29]Speed, when I watch you do some of the things you do, I feel like I'm watching someone paint or play music. When I go to the races, I go to watch you make art and it's beautiful and inspiring and everything that art should be, even though there are times when I have to close my eyes. But then there are other times, when you just take my breath away and it's at those moments, when I feel your father's chest swell and I know he's smiling, trying to pretend he doesn't have tears in his eyes, I just go to pieces. \n[30]Because I am so impossibly proud to be your mother. And even though your father doesn't say it, he is too. She puts her arms around him. \n[31]Don't worry. We'll figure this out. We just have to stick together. Something good will happen. You'll see.

We got a few fan favorites like the Gray Ghost, Sonic \"Boom-boom\" Renaldi and Prince Kabala. We got perenial powerhouses like Nitro Venderhoss, Gary \"Gearbox\" Kalinkov, and Mori Minimoto. \n[4]We're seeing some kind of commotion down at the trailer entrance. \n[5]Something big is going on because every race official has been-- wait, wait. An announcement is being made. A new driver is being added to the field. \n[6]As the cars take to the field you can feel the anticipation mounting in the audience. Something is different. There is an electricity in the air.

He's shattering the lap record. \n[24]No hesitation, nothing fazes him, no one seems capable of stopping him. \n[25]With a quarter lap to go Speed Racer is back, two cars beneath him and destiny. \n[26]It's a pandemonium!

I'm sorry for this intrusion, but I was hoping to have a word with you and Speed. Pops eyes the masked racer. \n[4]It's important. \n[5]We've been after Remmington for years for dozens of capital corporate crimes including WRL fixing but we haven't had the evidence we need to convict him. Until now. Sprittle and Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as Mom offers the masked racer a cup of coffee. \n[6]Racer X works closely with our WRL corporate crimes division, helping us recruit drivers like you, Speed. Most of the media, which you are now seeing is controlled by the Major Sponsors and they have done their best to paint him as a menace to the sport. The truth is he's our most valuable weapon against these villains. \n[7]If any of, you actually knew his identity, you would become targets for his enemies which include some of the most vicious Fixers in the world. Gulp. They both sink back down behind the couch. \n[8]You're familiar with the driver Katsu Okamoto? \n[9]For years he has been contracted by a Fixer named Cruncher Block who we know works for Remmington. Recently, Katsu has been forced to lose races that have led to a droop in the stock price of Okamoto Engineering. We believe this is a part of a corporate strategy to allow Mushi motors to buy control of Okamoto. Katsu doesn't want this to happen and he began resisting, thinking.that he could do it on his own. After Fuji, he realized he needed help. \n[10]Because he has a file with enough information to connect Block to Remmington which could put both of them behind bars for the rest of their lives. The problem is, he won't give us the file unless we help him stop the take over of his family's company. \n[11]There is an up-coming race that Katsu believes if he can win, it will catapult Okamoto Engineering back into the spotlight and double the cost of the buy out which should kill it. \n[12]There aren't any track races. This is a cross-country rally. \n[13]I know it seems cruel of me to ask, but Katsu made it clear that he had to have Speed an X on his team or there would be no deal. \n[14]You'll have the support of the entire C.I.B-- \n[15]I understand. If you change your \n[16]Speed, I want you to understand how much the C.I.B. appreciates your help on this. \n[17]They're airborne? You're sure? Good. Double the guard for her arrival in Bartimaeus. I gave my word nothing would happen to his sister and I mean to keep it. The Inspector gets another call. \n[18]Inspector Detector..-.Mrs. Racer? What kind of emergency? \n[19]Is there a problem here, officer? \n[20]The ruling on this is quite clear. Try to stop it and you'll be in blatant violation of the WRL charter, leaving me no option but to shut this years Prix down until a full investigation can be completed. \n[21]Try me. Remmington stews then spits a threat at Speed. \n[22]He did it. Racer X lowers his binos and turns to the inspector. \n[23]This could change everything. \n[24]My men are bringing the family down. Do you want to go with them? \n[25]Can I ask you a question? Do you ever think you made a mistake, hiding the truth from them?     162. ", "JOHNNY": "\n[1]Always great to be here.

I know a lot of T-180 drivers who I raced against who expected to win but found out racing a few laps on a track is a totally different animal than a cross-country rally. \n[7]Exactly. This isn't just about going fast. It's about endurance. More than anything, winning Casa Cristo is a test of will. \n[8]To compete in this race, you really have to have a killer instinct. Any sign of weakness or timidness is like blood in the water and you'll see how fast this race turns into a feeding frenzy. \n[9]The league has done a tremendous job to clean rally racing up.

What's your take on Racer X?     81. \n[7]But is he a head hunter? \n[8]Nuff' said. \n[9]The marathon as opposed to the sprint? \n[10]The reason.T-180 drivers have always come to Casa Cristo is because the winner is automatically offered an invitation to the Grand Prix next week. A hold over from the days when rally racing was far more popular then track racing. \n[11]Every race fan has heard the rumors of spearhooks, tire shanks and battery boosters. \n[12]The moment the Queen of Casa Cristo sees the sun, she'll signal the start of the race. \n[13]They're out of the city and heading into the Zunubian Desert. \n[14]Things have started heating up, as the cars head out across the desert flats. \n[15]A rear single set jump into a forward flip! \n[16]We're nearing the end of the first leg of the Casa Cristo as Snake Oiler, lead driver for the HydroCell team, roars through the streets of Cortega, heading for the finish.     96. \n[17]The HydroCell team jumped on the lead early and would not give it up. \n[18]They have their work cut out for them tomorrow. \n[19]The second leg of the Casa Cristo is under way. And the stage is set for what might be one of the most ferocious rallies we've seen in years. \n[20]Now the gloves are off and they are pounding one another, bumper to bumper, rail to rail!     114. ", "HORUKO": "\n[1]You see how we have to live? He ignores her, turning away as she starts to open it. She screams. Inside the goldfish bowl the piranha shreds a piece of meat that could be a finger, staining-the water red.     83. \n[2]This is wrong.what you are trying to do. \n[3]And if you die? Will then the price be high enough? \n[4]Oh, I am sorry. I was looking for Speed Racer. Speed moves to the door. \n[5]No. Something terrible has happened. \n[6]\n[7]You're sure, no cameras here? \n[8]Thank you so much. \n[9]Forgive me for intruding but I had to come before it was too late. Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another set-up. \n[10]This is not a trick. I swear to you. I am not my brother. \n[11]No. My security man believes I am still at the opera, so I only have a moment. She turns to Speed. \n[12]I am very sorry for what happened. what my father and brother did was not right and I am ashamed. \n[13]No.. It is they who are in need of a lesson. She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to Speed. \n[14]This rightfully belongs to you. He opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up. \n[15]My brother was planning to decline anyway but I studied the rules very carefully and as a member of the Okamoto team, if you present this invitation on the day of the race, they must allow you to compete. Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the back.     137. \n[16]You do not have to say anything. I only hope you drive as you did in Casa Cristo and you wipe the smiles from their faces. \n[17]I would say good luck Saturday but you do not need it. You are already very lucky to have such a family. ", "GRAY GHOST": "\n[1]We got ourselves a real race here! The two cars start dancing around each other; like two boxers sizing each other up. \n[2]Here we go, here we go. Wham. Ghost throws the first punch which Speed tries to slip but, the Ghost anticipates his move and slams Speed hard.     65. \n[3]Come on! Show me something! Show me what you got! Speed ducks down the bank, working each wheel into a hyper drift, reversing their position-- Locking the Ghost up and sending both cars spinning. \n[4]Ohhhh yeah! Yeeeeeahhhhh! \n[5]Here I come, kid! Watch out. Here I am! Nope--I'm over here! Wham! Wham! Speed tries to counter punch and the Ghost slips under. \n[6]You can't.touch me! I'm here! I'm gone! Speed is thrown back into the pack of cars that quickly swallow him up where he is-- Crunched into the wall by the Zokeo Communications car, pinned until-- Racer X slams into the Zokeo car, freeing Speed but causing several cars tp swerve wildly at which point-- The Three Roses car torpedoes Katsu's car-- Bursting into a blizzard of metal snowflakes while--     66. \n[7]Hey kid-- : \n[8]Just wanted to say good luck. He reaches out to shake, then whispers. \n[9]There's a million dollar bounty on your head. \n[10]Watch yourself. Your ruffling some pretty major feathers here.     146. \n[11]Our little dance at Fuji--that's how it should always be. \n[12]Where am I? Where am I? I'm here. I am over there. I'm Savior Faire! The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he can't seem to locate him. \n[13]I'm everywhere, baby! Wham! The Ghost is on him, pouncing, slipping into what feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro-- Shattering the Prince's car like a mis-struck diamond reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust.     152. \n[14]Welcome back kid. Been lonely up here without you. \n[15]Oh yeah, here we go, here we go. Speed flashes one way, then another, moving in ghost-like feigns, here there, and everywhere. \n[16]What's this? What's this? Hey now! That's my move! Before Ghost knows where to go, Speed ducks past--     160. ", "TEACHER": "\n[1]No, that's not exactly right. Your son seems to be interested in only one thing. Mom knows what's coming. \n[2]All he talks about, all he seems capable of thinking about is automobile racing. \n[3]And where is your husband? \n[4]Perhaps the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree. Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher glances back to her records. \n[5]Is your husband's name Rex? \n[6]This is the test he turned in last week. She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on. The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out: \n[7]Alright, pencils down, bring your \n[8]--to my desk. Ham! The door slams open and Speed shoots out. \n[9]Speed Racer, slow down! \n[10]All right! Malcom! Danny! Sprittle! To the Principal's office. March! There is a chorus of, \"I didn't do it, awwww, not fair.\" \n[11]Now! ", "SNAKE": "\n[1]This is supposed to be my race! I'm supposed to win! I got the green light!

He and his boys storm out, slamming the door behind them. \n[4]Here they come! Pick it up! \n[5]Watch it! What're you doin'?! The mountains undulate, the cars dip and rise caught in the current of this concrete river-- Flowing one way then another, the cars sawing across the belly of one bend, drifting into the curve of another \n[6]Just try it! Try to pass! Just try it! Racer X knows they're ready. \n[7]Not this time, punk! He throws the lever and beneath his car-- A violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that--- Speed hits going full throttle, immediately spinning wildly out of control. He screams trying to hold on as he spits out the end of the cave-- Smashing through the rail, separating from the earth-- Hanging for a moment against the soundlessness of the open sky-- Before dropping like a stone.     123. \n[8]Not again! Not again! He grabs at an ankle holster, yanking out a gun. ", "YOUNG SPEED": "\n[1]Fine. Are you going to the track? Mom said you were. You don't have to drop me off, I could just go with you. \n[2]Oh, come on, take me with you. Come on, please. \n[3]He doesn't have to know. I won't say anything. Nobody will know.
