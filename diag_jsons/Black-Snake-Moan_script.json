He talkin' on how Jesus was healin' the sick. And a man come up to the disciples and he say... Have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and sore vexed... He got the devil in his mind and sores on his skin. And he brought the boy to the disciples, but they could NOT cure him. \n[77]Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation... how long shall I suffer you? Bring the boy hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil. You hear that? Then the disciples say... Why could not we cast the devil out? And Jesus said unto them... \n[78]Listen now... This what he sayin' to us. He say... If ye have faith... if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto a mountain, remove hence... and it... shall... move. And nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible to you. You hear that? You just need a bit of faith. You just gotta believe you gonna get well, like I do. \n[79]That's better. You coolin' down. Okay. You rest. Okay. You rest. \n[80]Gal? Gal? \n[81]\n[82]You travelin' right now, gal. You asleep and you don't even know it. Now... come on inside with me. \n[83]Come on, gal... \n[84]Goin' over that hill. Goin' over that hill. Well, I ain't gonna stop until I reach my God's top. I'm goin' over the hill.

Wrote the book of the seven seals. \n[91]Hey. \n[92]Take it easy now. Don't rush it. \n[93]You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days. \n[94]After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya. \n[95]Found you on the side of the road. Someone took to beatin' on you pretty bad. You know who done that to you? \n[96]Well I don't... \n[97]Don't need none. \n[98]Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk. \n[99]Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to... \n[100]Let me say somethin' first... \n[101]Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right. \n[102]I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road... \n[103]Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night. \n[104]Gal, you ain't right yet. \n[105]How you let men treat ya like they do? \n[106]These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that? \n[107]You know what I'm talkin' about. All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks. \n[108]I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want. \n[109]I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach. \n[110]We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it... \n[111]God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness. \n[112]No ma'am. \n[113]In my house, you watch that lip... \n[114]You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya. \n[115]Ain't gonna be moved. \n[116]GAL! I ain't gonna be moved on this! \n[117]You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will. Right or wrong, you gonna mind me. Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE \n[118]Now you get up! And you get in my house! \n[119]Whose doin' is that? \n[120]Say we talk. Just take a seat on the sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to drink. \n[121]You may not remember. But you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down. Melted four ice trays. \n[122]Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me... \n[123]Think I'm gonna let you do me like that... \n[124]Okay, now... I ain't gonna hit'cha. Just lost my cool there. Now take that look out'cha eye. \n[125]No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness. \n[126]I said... STOP! \n[127]You hungry? \n[128]I put some back ache into growin' them greens. You should slow down and see how they taste. \n[129]Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong. \n[130]My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that? \n[131]Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong. Sting a bit? \n[132]Means ya healin'. So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story? \n[133]The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand. \n[134]Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story... Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in. Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL! \n[135]My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you! \n[136]\n[137]Didn't mean to go off on a tear like I did. I just got to thinkin' about things... \n[138]Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up? \n[139]Just some dresses. \n[140]I'm needin' some women's clothes. A few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But they gotta be nice. They gotta be proper. Clothes a woman would want, where she could feel and look like a woman without... you know, lookin' like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'. \n[141]That young lady's size, right'cher. \n[142]Mind I ask, what's all this business here? \n[143]For your hands? \n[144]I'll take a jar of that, too. \n[145]Lookin' for Miss Angela. \n[146]I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans. \n[147]Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank. \n[148]Look here. I got somethin' special for you. \n[149]This here is a whipped... body cream. And it's got a smell to it. Tell me what you think. \n[150]They call this Ginger Souffle. Best if it... if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub... or shower. \n[151]Well. Hope you enjoy it. \n[152]Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm headin' home. \n[153]\n[154]\n[155]Lincoln, come on back. \n[156]He's fine. Just had a bad fall. \n[157]R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place. \n[158]This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now. \n[159]You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time. \n[160]You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this. \n[161]Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say... \n[162]I told you to TURN BACK! \n[163]Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done. \n[164]I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home. \n[165]I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this. \n[166]Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby. \n[167]Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense.

Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is. \n[174]That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy. \n[175]My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me? \n[176]So... That your first time? \n[177]You struck some gold, didn't ya? \n[178]Shit. My first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn. She weighed two tons, if a pound.

Didn't mean to curse. \n[103]You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that.

I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT! \n[125]Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times. \n[126]You think God forgives people like that?

I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me. And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had. \n[138]I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout... \n[139]But...

Like your eyes can open a little bit more. \n[170]Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song. \n[171]No, you do it.

Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie. Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else. \n[184]I think... I think we're fucked up. Both of us. I know I am. But... that don't mean what I feel ain't true. It don't mean I can't love. And I know, how I been is... is... REALLY BAD! So if you want to quit on me... I understand. But please... please... don't. \n[185]Yes, ma'am. \n[186]I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow. \n[187]I want to. More'n anything.
