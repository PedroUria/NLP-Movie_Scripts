{"dialogues": {"TED": "\n[1]You met any of those old stars? \n[2]Ted. \n[3]I don't think so, not like yours. \n[4]Beats me. \n[5]Who? \n[6]What do you mean? \n[7]No way, not me. You got any other advice. \n[8]Sam the bellboy. Now there was a man. \n[9]Yeah. \n[10]You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting my shift. \n[11]Yeah, sure. \n[12]Correct. \n[13]Oh, I know. \n[14]Oh, I know... \n[15]An inspiration to us all. \n[16]An amazing man. \n[17]A man alone. \n[18]I know. \n[19]Tonight! \n[20]I can't. \n[21]No, I can't. I never worked the night shift before. \n[22]We were supposed to work it together. \n[23]Why not? \n[24]Since when? \n[25]I can't run this place by myself. \n[26]No, I can't. \n[27]Yeah, and he had fifty years of fuckin' practice, too. I haven't had a day. \n[28]-- Don't call me Teddy. \n[29]It's New Year's Eve. \n[30]What I have ain't butterflies. I can't handle this hotel all by myself. \n[31]You can say any goddamn thing you want -- \n[32]Okay... okay... okay... I'm calm, I'm cool, let's talk. \n[33]Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky Detective? \n[34]Okay. \n[35]-- For fifty bucks. \n[36]You're shirking your duties for this Nazi. For that you pay a price, and the price is fifty bucks. \n[37]Yeah, but what you're doin' to me ain't fair. And, you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position. So fifty bucks is the perfect price. \n[38]Green? Is that bad? Like you read auras or something like that? \n[39]Yeah, well what color are you seein' around me... how's the tip lookin? \n[40]You're booked in the Honeymoon Suite -- just one night? With all this luggage? \n[41]Okay... and how will you be paying? \n[42]Right. \n[43]What the hell you got in here, lady? Nuclear weapons? \n[44]Oh -- I forgot to show you how to turn on the Jacuzzi. \n[45]May I help you? \n[46]Oh yeah... you must be one of \"the others.\" And what're you carrying -- the Rock of Gibraltar? \n[47]You might be referring to the Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way... you can't miss it -- see all that furniture in the hallway -- \n[48]Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's fantastic. \n[49]Past New Year's? \n[50]Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet with flea powder, pour paint in the Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out the... where're your bags? \n[51]Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite. \n[52]All right -- lemme give ya a hand. \n[53]I'm a man doin' a job -- no hero. \n[54]About an hour. \n[55]Uh, thank you, ladies -- I'll be going now. If you need anything -- \n[56]Yeah, yeah, rosemary. \n[57]Ted... the bellboy. \n[58]Here's the things you asked for. Oh, and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish. \n[59]Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this fifty bucks! \n[60]Try me. I've been around, y'know. \n[61]Ha, like a coven of witches? \n[62]Oh. \n[63]I knew that! \n[64]Gee, you don't look a day over twenty! \n[65]Yeah? Is... is that her? \n[66]She turned to -- that -- here? \n[67]This girl here? This is the goddess Diana? \n[68]I hate to tell you this, but I kinda doubt she was a virgin. \n[69]Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. If you say she was a virgin, I'll believe it. \n[70]Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna turn back into this? \n[71]Now, that would be something worth seeing! \n[72]If this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations, I don't think I wanna hear this. \n[73]You swallowed what? \n[74]You mean, you were supposed to bring... like... like a guy's... and you...? \n[75]Yeah, sure. Whoa, what? You want my -- for the -- witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way -- nope. Besides, it's against hotel policy. I was warned: \"No sex with the clientele\"! \n[76]Ha, c'mon now, joke's over. Hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder. \n[77]Right! I knew that! \n[78]What's a nice girl like you doing in a coven, anyway? \n[79]Well, that's a good thing! A guy doesn't like surprises down there. \n[80]Oh, well, I see you've been gaining a lot of insight into your... girl powers... \n[81]Well, yeah, I'd say that seems to be the case... Ohhh, God! Betty's gonna kill me! \n[82]No. My boss. \n[83]Oh no! \n[84]Sure, baby. Yeah, I'll give ya a call. \n[85]Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do you want milk and cookies, or do you not? I can't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents. That's not what the machine tells me. You be good and you'll get milk and cookies, but for now leave me alone, please. I'll be up later to put you both to sleep. \n[86]Goddamn kids. \n[87]Room Service. \n[88]This is the front desk, sir. \n[89]If you care to go to the door and look on the other side, you'll find the room number. \n[90]I'm here alone, sir. \n[91]What do you need, sir? \n[92]Ice. \n[93]Right, sir. Ice. 404. I'll be with you momentarily. \n[94]Anybody home? \n[95]Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir. \n[96]Do I know you? \n[97]I brought your ice. \n[98]This has to be a mistake. Is this room 404? \n[99]A very upset man? \n[100]How do you know my name, sir? \n[101]Look my name is Ted, actually, and I have no idea what's going on here, but I've obviously come at a bad time. \n[102]Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're fucking wrong here. My name is Theodore, yes! My mother named me that and I hate the name. But I'm a fucking bellhop. People call me Ted. I work here. \n[103]Okay. \n[104]For what? \n[105]Look, obviously you two are working something out and if I could help you with your problem I would. \n[106]Look, is this about another man? Or something? \n[107]Ted's better. \n[108]I didn't say that... I... \n[109]I apologize... \n[110]That I said you might have been unfaithful? \n[111]You mind if I...? \n[112]I don't mean to upset you further, sir, but I think she was trying to say yes. \n[113]Absolutely not, I would never do that. \n[114]Say what? \n[115]I would never say that. \n[116]Of course you do. \n[117]How, sir? \n[118]What! \n[119]Listen, lady, I don't know what in the hell is going on here, but I'd appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that he's making a big mistake. \n[120]But I've never seen you people before, we're complete strangers. \n[121]I don't know if I can do this. It's too hard. \n[122]What? \n[123]I'm not going to shoot anybody. \n[124]And make me an accessory in the murder of your husband? \n[125]That's not fair. It just isn't fair. \n[126]Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well, maybe there are two sides to this thing. \n[127]So why's he got you tied up? \n[128]Nine thousand, three hundred and twenty-two times, to the best of my estimation. \n[129]I was just trying to help her breathe a little. \n[130]That's fine. \n[131]Look, man, if this is some kind of Voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife, there is absolutely no way. \n[132]Sorry, lady. \n[133]Look, I'm not playing this game anymore. \n[134]My name is not Theodore, it's TED, \n[135]What? \n[136]Sigfried? \n[137]Nice to meet you, Sigfried. \n[138]Thanks. \n[139]You okay, mister? I'll get help! \n[140]That's the wrong door, sir. \n[141]Hi... \n[142]Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation that I can't even begin to explain, but would you be so kind as to get help? Could you call the police, please? \n[143]You okay? \n[144]Sigfried? \n[145]I couldn't find it! \n[146]I thought you wanted to kill him. \n[147]I can't handle this alone, I'd better get help. \n[148]Thank God you're okay... \n[149]I think you're right and, if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going, you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding. \n[150]You'd be surprised what happens when people just listen to each other without succumbing to all that pain and anger. \n[151]That's a lie, Sigfried. I swear to God. \n[152]Why are you doing this? What have I ever done to you people? \n[153]She's lying again, mister. It's not that big. \n[154]Come on, man, she's lying. Can't you see she's fucking with you? \n[155]It's not me, mister, I swear. \n[156]That's beautiful. \n[157]Yes, actually. \n[158]Yes I would. \n[159]Okay. Okay. \n[160]What? \n[161]What was what like? \n[162]Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do you want me to say? \n[163]If I ever saw her again, I'd run the other way. \n[164]I promise. \n[165]I can see that. \n[166]Don't beat yourself up over it. \n[167]It's not for everyone, but maybe in your case it could help. \n[168]You people gonna be okay? \n[169]Would you like me to...? \n[170]Happy New Year. \n[171]Beats me. It's somewhere around here. \n[172]Hey, what's your name? \n[173]Front desk. \n[174]The champagne you ordered, sir. \n[175]Sure! \n[176]Three hundred? \n[177]Three's good. \n[178]Check up on 'em? \n[179]We can call out and hire a babysitter. \n[180]Look, sir, I'd like to help you out, but I really can't. I'm all alone here tonight. \n[181]I thought you said five hundred. \n[182]No, you distinctly said five hundred. \n[183]No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred. \n[184]Well then, if you say five hundred one last time, we got a deal. \n[185]No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve and I'm here alone. If there was somebody else here, no problem, but I'm by myself. And looking after your kids is a pain in the ass I don't need -- \n[186]-- No, they're not a pain in the ass, it's the situation that's a pain in the ass. \n[187]Yeah. It's Ted. \n[188]Before midnight? Then should I wake them up for the countdown to the New Year? \n[189]Okay. These are the rules. Don't break the rules and I won't break your necks. \n[190]I always wanted to say that. Someone said that to me when I was a kid. \n[191]Except they were joking. I'm not. \n[192]The rules are simple. Don't do anything you wouldn't do if your parents were here. If there's an emergency, call me on the phone, like your dad said. \n[193]Well, I've got a lot of work to do and I can't have you calling me every time you want a drink of water, so please limit your calls to emergencies only. \n[194]Okay. Please. Try to call only when necessary. Watch TV, and if you're good, I'll bring up some milk and cookies. Bye. \n[195]Front desk. \n[196]Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? I said if you don't bother me, you'll get milk and cookies. Now, do you want them or do you not? \n[197]I can't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents. \n[198]That's not what the machine tells me. \n[199]If you're good, you'll get milk and cookies, so leave me alone, please. I'll be up later to put you both to sleep. \n[200]Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don't call me. \n[201]I brought you some milk and cookies. If you want some you have to eat them now, because you're going to sleep. \n[202]Your parents said put you to bed before midnight. Well, it's before midnight. Maybe that way you'll leave me alone. \n[203]We were out of cookies, so I brought you milk and Saltines. Don't complain! Now hurry up and eat. You're going to bed right now. \n[204]Dip 'em in the milk! The milk will make them soft. \n[205]No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time. Now, I don't want you guys wandering around, so if you need to go to the restroom, go now. \n[206]You wanna look nice in case there's an earthquake, don'tcha? \n[207]Okay. Then stay in those clothes. \n[208]Oh, this is just some Mentholatum ointment. Come on, under the covers. Close your eyes and I'll tell you a story. \n[209]Your dad says he doesn't trust babysitters. I don't blame him. You know what my babysitter did to me once? I never told my parents, either. \n[210]I hated going to sleep. You know, it's nighttime and you wanna run around and act crazy. So what my babysitter did to make sure I'd go to sleep and not be tempted to get up, was, she'd take some of this vapor rub stuff... Can you smell this? \n[211]Well, she'd just dab a little of this over each eyelid, so that I would be sure and keep my eyes closed all night. \n[212]There. Now you've got some, too! Don't open your eyes or it'll burrrn, burn, burn. The smell helps clear your sinuses too, so it's doing double duty. \n[213]If you keep your eyes closed all night, it will wear off by morning. But DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE \n[214]Yes... I did. \n[215]And now look at me. \n[216]Good. You'll do just fine. Sleep well and I won't tell your parents about the champagne. \n[217]What do you want now, for Christ's sake! Who died? \n[218]What? \n[219]That's just your brother. Sound asleep. \n[220]You saw the body? \n[221]Impossible. You've got ointment on your eyes! You can't see shit! Now go to sleep! \n[222]Godammit, go to sleep! \n[223]You washed off the ointment? \n[224]All right. Now you listen to me... \n[225]I'm coming up and if there isn't a dead body by the time I get there, I'll make one myself. You! \n[226]Oh shit! \n[227]What the fuck is going on??!! \n[228]Your parents are on their way up and I'm not taking responsibility for this mess! \n[229]For what? \n[230]It's your feet! \n[231]Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck is this? \n[232]Police, it's an emergency! Hello, Police, this is the Mon Signor Hotel, get someone up here right fucking now, there's a DEAD WHORE stuffed under the mattress! \n[233]I'm dead fucking serious, there's a dead fucking Whore stuffed in the bedsprings of the fucking bed! \n[234]\n[235]Jesus!! \n[236]Let me speak to Betty. \n[237]She lives there. \n[238]Do you even know who I'm talking about? \n[239]Betty, not Eddy. \n[240]No, not particularly. She's got curly red hair. \n[241]She's not Japanese! I just said she had red hair. \n[242]Well, then get her on the phone, it's an emergency. \n[243]Tell 'em Teddy from work's on the phone, and it's a major fuckin' emergency. \n[244]Not Betty from work, I'm calling Betty! I'm Teddy. Just say Ted. \n[245]No Margaret, this hasn't been my best New Year. This year's starting off pretty badly. \n[246]Well, Betty -- the chick whose house you're at, even though you don't know her -- leaves me here all by myself on New Year's Eve. And first thing right off the bat, I'm fucked by a coven of witches. \n[247]A coven. A coven of witches. Well, one witch in particular. \n[248]No-no-no, she was... quite beautiful. \n[249]Yes. \n[250]Well, admittedly, that was the best part of the night. It was pretty fuckin' cool, actually. But it was still an unnerving way to start off the night. \n[251]Okay, let's just skip over the witches. \n[252]So, later, in another room, some crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in my face and forces me to play out some psychosexual drama with his wife. \n[253]No, he didn't make me fuck his wife, he thought I'd fucked his wife! He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun! \n[254]I don't know, I'm not a gun guy. It was big. \n[255]Yeah, something like that. \n[256]What difference does it make? \n[257]Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392, it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed at my fuckin' head! \n[258]I want you to get Betty on the phone! \n[259]Betty. \n[260]What's the problem? I don't got a problem, I got fuckin' problems! Wanna hear? \n[261]Well, most recently, there's room 716. There's a scary Mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest. There's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. There's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed. There're rooms blazing afire... There's a needle from God knows where stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what, and finally, there's me walking out the fuckin' door right now! Buenas noches. \n[262]Yeah. \n[263]Yeah, well, tough titty. They're just gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm out the door. \n[264]Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night -- \n[265]Yes, I did. \n[266]No, it's out. \n[267]Now, look -- \n[268]Look, I don't feel like -- \n[269]Okay. But get your ass here pronto. \n[270]Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay. How can I help you? \n[271]What the hell are you doing here? \n[272]Is that crazy husband of yours in there? \n[273]Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got everything you asked for -- \n[274]Actually, it's not Theodore, It's Ted. \n[275]No, thank you. \n[276]Okay, yeah, sure. \n[277]Thank you? \n[278]It's good. \n[279]It's fuckin' good. \n[280]Bellboy's fine. \n[281]No. \n[282]Where do you want this? \n[283]want to rush the movie star \n[284]The name's Ted, Angela. I only let people with loaded guns at my head call me Theodore. \n[285]No. \n[286]I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen your movie. \n[287]The Dog Catcher. \n[288]Do you mind me asking what's all this stuff for? \n[289]A block of wood. \n[290]Three nails. \n[291]A roll of twine. \n[292]A bucket of ice. \n[293]A donut. \n[294]And a hatchet. \n[295]Well, you be the judge. \n[296]Well, that's everything, so if you don't need me for anything else, I'll go back downstairs. \n[297]Look, guys, you paid for the room. As long as you don't break up the furniture, you can do whatever the fuck you want. And me personally, I don't care if you break up the furniture. You don't have to explain anything to me. Whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business. \n[298]Take part in what? \n[299]Yeah. \n[300]I don't think so. \n[301]You guys are drunk. \n[302]You guys wouldn't be doin' something this stupid unless you were drunk. \n[303]Why are you doing this? \n[304]How 'bout you guys, you're just gonna sit back and let your friends mutilate each other? \n[305]How 'bout you? \n[306]I don't have a part. \n[307]Hopefully. \n[308]I gotta get out of here. \n[309]I'm not gonna cut off his finger! \n[310]I'll take your money, and I'll sit back down. But a minute from now, I'm gonna walk out the door, and when I do, there'll be no hard feelings? \n[311]No. \n[312]Okay. \n[313]But when it's over, no matter what happens, I get the money? \n[314]Let's do it right now, before I change my mind. \n[315]Ready. ", "SIGFRIED": "\n[1]That's cute. In fact, the whole getup's kind of cute. The monkey suit's a nice touch, honey puss. \n[2]Theodore? What do you take me for, Theodore? \n[3]I am an upset man, Theodore. \n[4]I'm psychic, Theodore. \n[5]Let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, Theodore. The fact is you're here. \n[6]And I couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on New Year's Eve. \n[7]Look, I'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt -- That was insensitive of me, wasn't it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut to the chase, okay? \n[8]So apologize! \n[9]You are really beginning to annoy me, Theodore. \n[10]What are you saying? Are you saying I got a problem? Are you trying to say I don't give her what she needs? That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!! \n[11]Let's get our ABC's right, here, Theodore. Theodore, right? \n[12]Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife cheats on me? \n[13]Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and Angela here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. I demand an apology! \n[14]Don't move. I've got to take this. \n[15]What? We ain't got any needles here, kid. Just a big fucking gun. \n[16]Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember. \n[17]I want you to pray for forgiveness, Theodore. \n[18]Now say after me, \"I apologize...\" \n[19]For what? \n[20]For fucking what? \n[21]\"That I said you might have been unfaithful?\" Listen, Theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. Truth... truth is all it hears. Say the following, \"I, Theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!\" \n[22]Satisfied? \n[23]Do you accept the fucking apology? \n[24]You always gotta get the last word, don't you? It's one way with you, Angela, isn't it? I give and I give and I get nothing back. \n[25]She just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops... \n[26]Stupid me, for a second I thought you were going to say something... something like, \"I'm sorry.\" HA! \"I'm sorry.\" You're absolutely right, love cakes, I wouldn't want it that way. That's one thing you can say about Angela. She'll never do anything she doesn't want to do. If the feeling ain't there, she just isn't going to do it. There is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesn't want to. Never let that happen to you, Theodore. It makes you feel very little indeed. \n[27]Go ahead. Spit it out. \n[28]Are you condescending to me, Theodore? \n[29]Why don't you just say it? \n[30]That you think I'm an idiot. \n[31]You think you're superior to me, don't ya, Theodore? You don't think I notice there is a gag in the woman's mouth. \n[32]Naturally \"of course.\" And do you know how I know that? \n[33]Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH! I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about communication, Theodore. It's all in the eyes... Him? Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's drag it out. \n[34]I was just beginning to think I could trust you, Theodore. Silly me. \n[35]Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You don't mind me calling you Teddy, do you? \n[36]I used to have a little bunny rabbit named Teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. But don't let me stop you, Teddy... no need to play sneaky-poo. \n[37]I said, nibble, asshole! Now! \n[38]What's the matter, no whiz left in the cheese? I'm not cramping your style, am I? \n[39]It's almost all over, Theodore, and soon you can go home to Mommy. \n[40]Sigfried. \n[41]My name is Sigfried. \n[42]Yah, Sigfried. \n[43]Very impressive, Ted. \"Theo the Thumper?\"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid. Ted it will be. \n[44]Get me the nitro... it's in the bathroom cabinet. Now! \n[45]It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, I'm fucking dying here! \n[46]I tie a pretty good knot, don't I, Ted? \n[47]Never felt better. \n[48]Come on, honey, don't get mad. It was just a little test, and I'm glad I did it because now I'll know forever that you really do love me. Truly and deeply. \n[49]Oh, no. I heard you and there was genuine care in that voice. Can't be denied. Can it, Ted? \n[50]He's got a huge cock? \n[51]Show it to me. \n[52]Show it to me. \n[53]Stop talking about his cock, will you?! \n[54]Please, don't leave me. I'll call you Ted from now on. \n[55]Personally, I don't give a fuck, Ted, it's just I don't want to be alone right now. I'm feeling a little vulnerable. \n[56]No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted. You know my father used to say that forgiveness is the only thing that evil can't sink its teeth into. \n[57]Kind of nice down here on the floor, isn't it, Ted? \n[58]Things take on a whole new perspective... You'd like my trust, wouldn't you, Ted? \n[59]I just got one thing to ask you and I'll let you go. \n[60]Tell me straight now. \n[61]What was it like? \n[62]You know, you and her. \n[63]Either way you're fucked, right? You ever gonna see her again, Theodore? \n[64]Promise? \n[65]You're lying, but I can respect that, Ted. If you told me, it would no longer be a secret, and secrets have a power, kid. You open that box and they disappear forever. A bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got. In the end, when all the people you knew are dead and gone, all you'll have left are you secrets. And when you die, the box is open and it all blows away -- dust to dust -- all the anger, jealousy, desire and love just blow away. \n[66]So you know what I say, let's call it a truce, kiddo. \n[67]I'm a man of love, Theodore. Love is all I live for. \n[68]Maybe to a fault. \n[69]That's nice of you to say, Ted, but I probably should make a clean break of it, cut her loose and get my own place. I just can't imagine living without her. Do you think I should seek professional help? \n[70]You ever been out on the ocean at night? \n[71]I have... scary as a motherfucker, all that darkness around you. It's like a big black carpet rolled out as far as the eye can see. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll see a light. It could be as small as a little spark, but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness, straight to you. It could be another boat, or some distant fire on an island, but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to lie at your feet. That's love, Ted, it's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness. \n[72]Where the hell have you been? ", "CHESTER": "\n[1]Entrez, entrez, come in, come in. \n[2]-- Not a problem, my friend Mr. Bellboy. \n[3]So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying -- would you care for some champagne? That's not what I was saying, but would you care for some champagne? \n[4]Ya sure? Cristal. It's the best. I never liked champagne before I had Cristal, now I love it. \n[5]-- As I was saying, Ted, don't worry about being late. For our purposes, promptness is far behind thoroughness. \n[6]Chin-chin. \n[7]Whadya say, Ted? \n[8]No, not thank you. Whadya say about the tasty beverage? \n[9]Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good. Let's try it again, shall we? So, Ted, whadya think about the beverage. \n[10]You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's fuckin' Cristal, everything else is piss. \n[11]Knock it off, you're making my friend Ted here uneasy. Pay no attention to Norman here, Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now me, myself, when I think of bellboys I think of -- \"bellboy\" isn't an insult, is it? Is there another name for what you do that I'm ignorant of? Bellman, bellperson -- \n[12]Good. I'm glad they haven't changed that. There's a friendliness to \"bellboy.\" As I was saying, Ted, when Norman thinks of bellboys, he thinks of Quadrophenia. \n[13]You should, it's one of Jerry's better movies. He never says a word through the entire film. A completely silent performance. How many actors can pull that off? And he has to go to France to get respect. That says it all about America right there. The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper in this fuckin' country gonna write articles calling the man a genius. It's not right. It's not right and it's not fair. But why should that surprise anybody? When has America ever been fair? We might be right every once in a while, but we're very rarely fair. \n[14]You in a hurry, Ted? \n[15]Good, then stop playing \"Beat the Clock.\" Now let me introduce you to everybody. \n[16]Our friend from downstairs you already seem to be acquainted with. \n[17]Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound friend. \n[18]Have you ever seen Angela in a one- piece? \n[19]Well, it's somethin' to see. The Man sitting in the chair, with the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand and the sense of humor, is Norman. Norman, say hello to Ted. \n[20]The sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is Leo. And the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife Ellen. Leo, say hello to Ted. \n[21]Which brings me to me, Chester Rush, Ted. Pleased to meetcha. \n[22]It's quite all right, Ted, nothing to feel sorry about. That's why God invented video. But you know, Ted, a lot of people did see it. \n[23]Who drank out of this bottle last? \n[24]Who drank out of this bottle -- not the other bottles -- this bottle last? \n[25]It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's what's wrong. The champagne -- the fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat. \n[26]I was saying, Ted, a lot of people did see it. And not just on video, either. Leo, what was the final take on domestic? \n[27]I'm cool, so talk to your wife. \n[28]72.1 million dollars. That's before video and before foreign, and before pay-TV and before free TV. We're talking fuckin' asses in fuckin' seats. Before all that other shit, The Wacky Detective made 72.1 million dollars. \n[29]And my new one, The Dog Catcher, it's projected to break a hundred. The Dog Catcher. \n[30]Now let's stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us. \n[31]One thing at a time, Ted. I'm not a frog and you're not a bunny, so let's not jump ahead. C'mon, Norman, you should be interested in this. \n[32]Good. \n[33]That's how many Peter Lorre asked for. Continue, Ted. \n[34]That's definitely a roll of twine. Continue. \n[35]You into it? \n[36]Go on. \n[37]That's for me. Continue. \n[38]A hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what I asked for. \n[39]Whadya think? \n[40]You heard him, Ted. \n[41]We now return you to The Man from Rio, already in progress. \n[42]When we do it, you'll have something to see. \n[43]Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite done yet. Why don't you take a seat at the bar, get comfortable, and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you. \n[44]Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause we want you to take part. \n[45]First off, let me say that there's nothing homosexual about what we're going to ask you to do. There's nothing sexual at all about what we want. But I was thinkin' you might be thinkin' we want you to do some sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off, shit like that. Let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want -- \n[46]No, you can't jump in here, this is my story. \n[47]Hey, if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out. \n[48]Move the nomination be closed! \n[49]Leo, the floor is yours. \n[50]Well, that goes without saying, but that doesn't mean we don't know what we're doing. \n[51]-- Cristal. When you're drinkin' anything else, you're drinking champagne. When you're drinkin' Cristal, you say you're drinkin' Cristal. \n[52]\"...Oh, really?\" \n[53]Thrill of the bet. I'm the one with something to lose here. 'Cause I can pretty near guarantee that I love my car more'n Norman loves his pinky. \n[54]Which brings us to your part in this little wager. \n[55]Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta say: \"The less a man makes declarative statements, the less he's apt to look foolish in retrospect.\" Now there're some inherent obstacles in this undertaking. First of all, I'm not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre on that show, travelin' the countryside collecting fingers. We're all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman to lose his finger. We just wanna chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile on ol' Norman, we'll put his finger on ice and rush 'im to a hospital, where in all likelihood be able to sew it back on. \n[56]So Norman's protected. His interests have been looked after. My interests, on the other hand, have not. I am as emotionally attached to my car as Norman is physically to his finger. I'm putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager. Now, if I lose, I lose, I have no problem with that. I'm a big boy, I knew what I was doing. However, if I win, I wanna win. If Norman lights his lighter ten times in a row, he's gonna have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever. But if I win, it's not inconceivable that Leo or myself, at the last minute, might not be able to wield the ax. Which brings us full circle to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed Ted. We want you to be the diceman. \n[57]Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill here with your name on it, whether you do what we ask or not, just to sit back down in the chair for one minute more. \n[58]Maybe you will and maybe you won't, but that has nothing to do with this hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door. But if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it, you'll be a hundred dollars richer. \n[59]Well, I want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that, but, yeah, we'll either convince you or we won't. No hard feelings. Right, guys? \n[60]Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper. Let us know when one minute begins and when it ends. \n[61]Okay, pay attention here, Ted, I ain't got much time. Now I'm gonna make two piles here on the bar. One pile, which is yours. And another pile, which could be yours. Now, what you have to be aware of is we're gonna do this bet, one way, or the other. Whether it's you who holds the ax, or the desk clerk downstairs, or some bum we yank off the street. \n[62]Shhhh, I'm the closer. How much is on the bar already? I lost count. \n[63]Six hundred. Ted, do you know how long it takes the average American to count to six hundred? \n[64]One minute less than it takes to count to seven hundred. You know, Ted, a person's life is made up of a zillion little experiences. Some, which have no meaning, are insignificant and you forget them. And some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life -- -- barring Alzheimer's of course. Now, what we're proposing is so unusual, so outside the norm, that I think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks. So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be. So, are you gonna remember for the next forty years, give or take a decade, how you refused a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work, or how you made a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work? \n[65]Well, Ted, what's it gonna be? \n[66]As long as you do your part, you can take the pile, walk out the door, and not say another word. \n[67]Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect! This is great! This is a moment in time none of us will ever forget. \n[68]Norman, you ready? \n[69]Ted, you ready? \n[70]Okeydoke. Norman, begin. ", "BETTY": "\n[1]Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute! \n[2]I just want to say good-bye. \n[3]Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your boss. \n[4]Yeah, sure. \n[5]I just want you to know, from the owner and all the staff, your fifty years of service have been an inspiration to us all. You're a legend in your own time, and the Mon Signor will never be the -- \n[6]Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start the night shift? \n[7]Well, let me buy you a drink. \n[8]You're not an alcoholic, are you; one drink won't kill you. \n[9]After fifty years, Sam retires, and you're taking over the night shift. \n[10]You're filling some mighty big shoes. \n[11]Sam was a legend in the hotel business. \n[12]A bellhop's bellhop. \n[13]He ran the night desk for fifty years, all by himself. \n[14]No desk clerk. No night man. No help. Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits. \n[15]And you're gonna do the same. \n[16]Tonight. \n[17]Yes, tonight. \n[18]Yes, you can. \n[19]Oh night shift -- smight shift. \n[20]I know, but I can't. \n[21]I'm having a New Year's Eve party. \n[22]Actually, I'm not having it. My roommate is. And there's this guy. German guy. He's gonna be there. And so am I. \n[23]Oh, sure ya can. \n[24]Sam ran this place by himself for fifty years. \n[25]Look, Teddy, calm down -- \n[26]Ted, the night's cake. It's easy. The day's when it's busy. During the night there's nothing to do. \n[27]Which'll make it less busy than normal. Ever worked on Christmas? Unless you sell turkeys, business is dead. You just got butterflies, that's all. \n[28]Okay, let's calm down a minute. Slow it down, cool it off. Let's just talk. \n[29]-- Ted? I thought we were calming down? I thought we were cooling off? No hostility. Say good-bye to hostility. We're just talking. \n[30]Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to do is hold the fort. It's New Year's Eve. Most of the guests are going out. You'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three... four... five... in the morning. Nobody's having any parties, a few get-togethers, but no parties. You got about three people checking in tonight, that's it. The only variable is Chester Rush in the penthouse. \n[31]Yeah, him and his entourage checked in last night. They're in the penthouse. The only reason I refer to it as a variable is that he's a movie star. Ya never know about movie stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's cake. \n[32]And look, if you have any problems, call me at the party. \n[33]Great -- \n[34]Fifty bucks! \n[35]One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's not a fair price. You're taking advantage of the situation. Twenty bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair price. \n[36]Okay, but don't be a pussy. You don't bother me unless it's an emergency. In fact, for fifty bucks, you better not call me unless the fuckin' building's burning down. \n[37]Get ready to take the desk. \n[38]Yeah, whatcha screamin' about? \n[39]Yeah, I'm Betty, it's my fuckin' place, who the fuck are you? \n[40]Ted, what's the problem? \n[41]Sure. \n[42]Is that the penthouse? \n[43]That's the Chester Rush party, they want something. \n[44]Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're freaked, I know you're stressed. You've had a real bad night -- \n[45]-- You say there's a dead body in a room? \n[46]No problem, this is a hotel, we've had dead bodies before, it's just the price of doing business. You said the hotel was on fire. Is it still on fire? \n[47]Good, sprinkler system worked like a charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've had enough. Perfectly understandable. I'll take care of everything else. The only thing I ask is that you take care of Chester Rush. Then you can leave. \n[48]Ted, he's a very important guest of this hotel. In fact, he is the most important guest at the hotel. The Mon Signor used to be a haven for movie stars. Through the thirties and forties, and the first half of the fifties, more movie stars -- if you break it down on a night-by-night basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor than any other hotel in Hollywood. Now, we had some hard time in the eighties, even though we were the official hotel of Cannon Pictures, but we're coming back strong in the nineties. And a movie star clientele is important to that comeback. If we can keep stars of his magnitude happy, we're on our way. So, Ted, just take care of him, then you can leave. \n[49]He probably just wants some champagne! You can do that, can't you? Please just take care of him, the entire staff of the Mon Signor is begging you! \n[50]You're a good man, Ted. Thanks. ", "ANGELA": "\n[1]We don't have time to play charades here, asshole! Untie me quick. \n[2]Look, whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a situation here you can't just wish your way out of. \n[3]Everyone starts out strangers, Ted, it's where we end up that counts. Hurry up. \n[4]Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime? \n[5]I don't mean literally, you ignoramus. \n[6]Forget it, listen to me. There's a gun in my suitcase behind the bed, it's loaded... \n[7]Fine. Get the gun and I'll shoot \"anybody.\" \n[8]Get a fucking grip on yourself. First off, who says he's my husband? And second, we are a long way from fair here, fair is back in jolly old England eatin' crumpets and sipping on tea. \n[9]There are two sides to a plate, still you only eat off of one. Now GET THE \n[10]I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun! \n[11]Come on, Ted. Come over here just for a minute. You can do it. Come on, Ted. You look like a good guy. \n[12]That's it, Teddy. You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured. \n[13]Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag back in, and remember the gun! \n[14]Where's the fucking nitro? \n[15]You took long enough. Untie me, for Christ's sake, you fucking upset him and he's dying. \n[16]You'd make a great cop, Theodore. \n[17]You bastard! \n[18]If the simple fact that I didn't want your bloated, dead body lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very fucking moment. \n[19]You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for you to say after you fuck another man's wife. You should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions. \n[20]When I think of all the times you were inside me promising me a better life, it makes me want to puke. \n[21]What didn't you do, stick man? Unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock. \n[22]Put it this way, God made up for what he did to Gumby with Ted here. \n[23]Show him your cock, Theodore. \n[24]It's hard to stop talking about something so huge. I could go on and on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop, wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile, Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber, salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong, dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy, prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee, wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol, joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third- leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick. \n[25]Junior, the little head, little guy, Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake, one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder, shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter, instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod, cherrypicker, log, pole. \n[26]You'd better go check to see if I killed anybody downstairs. \n[27]We're fine, Ted. \n[28]Another time, Ted. \n[29]Hi, Theodore. \n[30]Having a drink. \n[31]Are you kidding, he'll be asleep till Christmas. \n[32]His name's Theodore. \n[33]Oh, me and Theodore go way back. Don't we, Theodore? \n[34]We met at the pool. \n[35]After talkin' about it all night, they better. I wanna see a show. \n[36]Look at the poor guy. Just spit it out. \n[37]Can I jump in here? \n[38]Theodore's been here fifteen minutes and you've talked about everything but. \n[39]I don't care. \n[40]Helluva night, huh, Ted? \n[41]Ted. Take the money. \n[42]Six hundred. \n[43]You know, I'm gonna call it a night and go back to my room. It's been fun. \n[44]You okay, lady? \n[45]I said -- you looking for someone? \n[46]Lady, I haven't seen anybody. ", "ATHENA": "\n[1]Pleeze be careful -- my God. You have no idea... \n[2]I'm usually a good tipper, but this one -- this cab driver -- he had green all around him.

We do need a few things. \n[24]We need fresh rosemary from the kitchen. Mostly what we need is from the kitchen. Hey, are you listening? \n[25]And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher salt if you don't got no sea salt. A bottle of spring water -- Italian please, not French shit. \n[26]And some ginger, two of the eyes of a trout fish, and a piece of raw meat, liver if you have it. \n[27]Shut up, you little shit. \n[28]Get to work, man. \n[29]I demand this stop now, Elspeth! \n[30]Now that the fucking melodrama is over, can we start the goddamn ritual -- pleeze? \n[31]We are communing here on New Year's Eve to bring to life the great goddess Diana, who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today. \n[32]Diana, great beautiful one, we make these offerings to you, that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover, your virginal blood, of your very life.
