{"dialogues": {"KIRK": "\n[1]Make it two -- her shot's on me. \n[2]Don't you want my name before you completely reject me? \n[3]You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim Kirk. If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up. \n[4]Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what? \n[5]They don't have last names in your world? \n[6]They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it \"Jim\"? \n[7]Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying. What's your focus? \n[8]Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means you've got a talented tongue. \n[9]Well.    Not only. \n[10]Oh, baby, I'm the smartest. \n[11]You could handle me.    That's an invitation. \n[12]At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like your hairline. \n[13]You heard me, Moon Beam. \n[14]Okay, so go get some more guys, come back and it'll be an even fight. \n[15]You can... whistle really loud, y'know that? \n[16]... and who am I, Captain Pike? \n[17]He sure learned his lesson. \n[18]-- why are you talking to me? \n[19]Maybe I love it. \n[20]Come to think of it, I do want to feel special. You know what? I'm gonna go start a book club-- \n[21]Enlist. You must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month-- \n[22]We're even, right?   I can go. \n[23]Live it up. \n[24]Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three. \n[25]At ease, Gentlemen. Never did get that first name. \n[26]I think these things're pretty safe-- \n[27]I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space. \n[28]Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--? \n[29]So you'll do it for me, right? \n[30]I didn't ask if you have interest, I asked if you'd do it. \n[31]Because I've failed the test twice. \n[32]So Bones: why do they make us take it? \n[33]And you're the greatest -- thank you. \n[34]Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date. \n[35]You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna be-- no idea. \n[36]... Yeah. I sent you a message. \n[37]Your hearing is scary-- you sure both your parents are human? \n[38]You and I have a big day tomorrow -- \n[39]If I pass, will you tell me your first name? \n[40]I think the fact that you picked up a transmission of a Klingon prison escape is very interesting. \n[41]\"Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them... Captain.\" \n[42]That's okay. \n[43]Yeah, don't worry about it. \n[44]Nah. \n[45]Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship. \n[46]Alert medical. \n[47]I understand. \n[48]Mmmm... no. \n[49]Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds. \n[50]Are they? \n[51]Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon each should do -- let's not waste ammunition. \n[52]Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So. We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one on board was injured and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway. \n[53]Anything else? \n[54]Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly. \n[55]Your point being? \n[56]Respectfully.    Define \"cheating\". \n[57]Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable. \n[58]Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat. \n[59]I don't believe in no-win scenarios -- \n[60]Please, enlighten me. \n[61]\"I of all people?\" \n[62]How long did it take you to look that up? \n[63]Maybe you just don't like that I beat your test. \n[64]What an idiot I am for taking that personally -- \n[65]Enlighten me again. \n[66]So you're telling me the point.      Of the whole thing. Is to be afraid? \n[67]Have you taken the test, Commander Spork? \n[68]You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan. And I'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all? \n[69]And if that's the case -- What's that say about your ability to make command decisions? \n[70]Who was that pointy-eared bastard? \n[71]Excuse me, you didn't call my name. Kirk, James T.. \n[72]... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good. \n[73]What are you doing? \n[74]I might throw up on you. \n[75]Bones. Thanks for getting me on board. But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking. \n[76]-- what's this?! \n[77]-- Bones -- we have to stop the ship-- \n[78]--- what? How the hell would I know?     Is Uhura on board? \n[79]Computer, locate crew member Uhura -- \n[80]We're flying into a trap. \n[81]-- ow!   Stop it! \n[82]The transmission from the Klingon prison planet -- what exactly did you hear? \n[83]Who was it who escaped? What was the ship that was stolen--?! -- what's happening to my mouth? \n[84]Numb tongue? \n[85]\n[86]Captain Pike-- Sir, we have to stop ship! \n[87]Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural disaster, it's being attacked -- by Romulans. \n[88]Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting storm in space -- that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin. You know that, I read your dissertation. Which was good. \n[89]Fact: This ship -- which had formidable and advanced weaponry -- was never seen or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin attack took place on the edge of Klingon space and at 11-hundred hours last night there was an escape from a Klingon prison planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and it was reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock. \n[90]We're warping into a trap-- there are Romulans waiting for us, I promise you that. \n[91]It's because they're being attacked. Captain. Please. \n[92]... okay. \n[93]Once we knock out that machine... Sir, what happens to you? \n[94]So what kinda combat training d'you have? \n[95]... fencing. \n[96]\n[97]\n[98]Kirk to Enterprise -- they just launched something toward the planet! \n[99]\n[100]\n[101]\n[102]\n[103]... yeah, not a problem. \n[104]The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE? Are you nuts?! \n[105]Hey. Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything-- I know it looks like I was... using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I just hope you'll forgive me. \n[106]... you're not Gaila, are you? \n[107]Sorry. \n[108]Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a target. \n[109]That is what he's suggesting and I don't buy it. \n[110]Then what would an angry future Romulan want with Captain Pike? \n[111]What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over and get Pike back. \n[112]\"Illogical\"-- you're funny. \n[113]-- what about assigning Engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield? \n[114]There won't be a next engagement, Spock: by the time we've \"gathered\", it'll be too late -- how many planets are you willing to risk? You say he's from the future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable. \n[115]Yeah, don't worry ab -- \n[116]Computer...    where am I? \n[117]Bite me, how's that. \n[118]\n[119]Lieutenant's log, supplemental: I'm preparing a testimonial for my Starfleet court martial assuming there's still a Starfleet left. \n[120]Acting Captain Spock -- whose only form of expression's apparently limited to his left damn eyebrow -- has marooned me on Delta Vega in what I believe to be a violation of security protocol 49.09, governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a st-- \n[121]Hey... thank you... \n[122]-- how d'you know my name? \n[123]\n[124]-- no, I don't know you -- the only Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy. \n[125]Stop.   Please.     I don't understand. \n[126]Bullshit. \n[127]Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea how you know what you know. But I don't know you and if you are Spock we're not friends. You hate me. You marooned me here for mutiny... \n[128]You're the captain.   Pike was taken hostage. \n[129]What do you know about him? \n[130]What're you doing--? \n[131]Nero's planet was destroyed-- \n[132]... so you do feel... \n[133]Going back in time... you changed all our lives. \n[134]Tactical and Communications -- \n[135]-- he's the helmsman, why? \n[136]... he'd call it a damn miracle. \n[137]Where you came from... did I know my father? \n[138]... Captain? \n[139]\n[140]... hello?! \n[141]Excuse me? \n[142]What? \n[143]You know him? \n[144]I know that dog. What happened to it? \n[145]What is he talking about? \n[146]-- you're coming with us, right? \n[147]You're telling me I can't tell you I'm following your own orders? Why not? What happens? \n[148]How, over your dead body? \n[149]So I need to emotionally compromise you? \n[150]Hm. \n[151]You know... coming back in time... changing history... that's cheating. \n[152]-- no-- shit! \n[153]-- no--nonono-- \n[154]COMEONCOMEONCOMEON -- like the simulator: manual control enabled, pressure seal: enabled -- shutdown-- \n[155]\n[156]You all right? \n[157]-- let's get to the bridge-- \n[158]Surprise. \n[159]He's with me. \n[160]You're the genius, you figure it out. \n[161]Well I'm not telling. Captain. \n[162]Does that frustrate you? My lack of cooperation... does it make you angry? \n[163]-- Don't answer him. \n[164]What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was just destroyed -- your mother murdered -- and you're not even upset? \n[165]HA! And yet you said fear was necessary for command. I mean -- did you see that bastard's ship? Did you see what he did? \n[166]So are you afraid or aren't you?!? \n[167]Then why don't you stop me. \n[168]What is it like? Not to feel? Anger. Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?! \n[169]You must not feel anything! It must not even compute for you! You must not have loved her at all--! \n[170]Yeah we do. \n[171]Thanks for the support! \n[172]... so do I. Attention crew of the Enterprise.   This is James Kirk... \n[173]Mr. Spock has resigned commission and advanced me to acting Captain. I know you were all expecting to regroup with the fleet, but I've ordered a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth. \n[174]I want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes. Either we're going down, or they are. Kirk out. \n[175]-- yeah, you know that's complicated -- \n[176]No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain now! I don't have to tell you anything! Now listen: we need to figure out a way to catch up and get to Nero's ship. \n[177]Then we find a way to get on that ship and steal the black hole device away from them. \n[178]Uhura: anything from Captain Pike? \n[179]Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask permission to-- \n[180]What blind spot? \n[181]I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock. \n[182]Then I'm coming with you. \n[183]See, we're getting to know each other. \n[184]Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel you have a tactical advantage fire on that ship. Even if we're still aboard. It's an order. \n[185]Her first name is... \n[186]Energize. \n[187]Mine had a gun. \n[188]Is he alive? \n[189]Let's move. \n[190]Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone. \n[191]Wow.   That's weird. \n[192]Just trust me.      Can ya do that? \n[193]I'll get Pike. \n[194]Came back, Sir. Just like you ordered. \n[195]Nice timing, Lieutenant -- \n[196]Hail them -- now! \n[197]This is Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is compromised -- too close to the singularity to survive without assistance -- which we are willing to provide. \n[198]We show them compassion-- it may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like that. \n[199]You got it. Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got! \n[200]Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here, Scotty! \n[201]\n[202]\n[203]\n[204]\n[205]I relieve you, Sir. \n[206]Thank you, Sir. \n[207]Scotty how are we? \n[208]Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus-- \n[209]... Permission granted. \n[210]It would be my honor, Commander. Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.     Take us out. \n[211]I relieve you, Sir. \n[212]Thank you, Sir. \n[213]Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the journey itself... is home. ", "SPOCK": "\n[1]No. \n[2]I am hardly \"anxious\", mother. And \"fine\" has variable definitions. \"Fine\" is unacceptable. \n[3]May I ask a personal query? \n[4]Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all emotion... I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you. \n[5]It was logical to cultivate multiple options. \n[6]If you would clarify, Minister-- what \"disadvantage\" are you referring to? \n[7]Council -- ministers.    I must decline. \n[8]Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished. \n[9]I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your \"insight\" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper. \n[10]... I do not know. \n[11]Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test. \n[12]To deceive by trickery. \n[13]Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario -- \n[14]Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson. \n[15]You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death. \n[16]Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not? \n[17]How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat? \n[18]I am Vulcan. \"Like\" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar. \n[19]Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test. \n[20]The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain. \n[21]Fear is necessary, yes. \n[22]Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions. \n[23]Yes, Lieutenant? \n[24]Indeed you were -- \n[25]An exceptional achievement, to be su-- \n[26]Consistently, yes-- \n[27]It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism. \n[28]Oh.     Yes, I believe you are. \n[29]Captain, engineering reports \"ready for launch\". \n[30]Have you disengaged the External Inertial Dampener? \n[31]The cadet's logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion. \n[32]Captain, they're locking torpedoes! \n[33]Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere-- its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities! \n[34]Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted. \n[35]Captain. Please. I apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me. \n[36]Dr. Puri, report -- \n[37]Then you have just inherited his responsibility as Chief Medical Officer. \n[38]Chekov, run gravitational sensors -- I want to know what they're doing to the planet. \n[39]They're creating a black hole... at the center of Vulcan? \n[40]How long does the planet have? \n[41]Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all frequencies -- maintain standard orbit -- \n[42]To evacuate the Vulcan High Council-- they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them-- \n[43]It's not possible -- they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself-- \n[44]Step aside -- I'm going to the surface. \n[45]Energize -- \n[46]The planet's not safe, it has only seconds left -- we must evacuate now -- \n[47]Spock to Enterprise: take us back now! \n[48]\n[49]Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42: I have assumed command of the Enterprise. \n[50]We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero. \n[51]Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten thousand survived. While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species. \n[52]... I need... \n[53]I need for us all to continue performing admirably. \n[54]Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth? \n[55]That's not it.     He said he wanted me to see something.     The destruction of my home planet. \n[56]The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time. \n[57]If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth. \n[58]Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant. \n[59]We're technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical. \n[60]We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement -- \n[61]You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today -- thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party. \n[62]Precisely. Whatever lives we might have lived, if the time continuum was disrupted... our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three-- \n[63]Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been difficult. \n[64]I'm simply acknowledging your difficulties. \n[65]I welcome it. \n[66]... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential. \n[67]I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise. \n[68]I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error. \n[69]Bring up video. \n[70]Security, this is the captain -- seal engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three -- set phasers to stun. \n[71]Who are you? \n[72]We're travelling at warp -- how did you manage to get aboard this ship? \n[73]As Captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question. \n[74]You are not a member of this ship's crew. Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you beamed ab -- \n[75]You will answer me. \n[76]Escort them to the Brig. \n[77]Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate-- \n[78]Yes, of course I-- \n[79]I will not... allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion. \n[80]Step away from me, Mr. Kirk. \n[81]-- back away -- \n[82]Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been... emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log. \n[83]That would be unwise. \n[84]I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a child. Have I made so little progress? \n[85]I feel anger. For the one who took her life. An anger I cannot stop. \n[86]Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct. \n[87]I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr. Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero's ship. \n[88]Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device. \n[89]Also, my mother was human. Which makes Earth the only home I have left. \n[90]I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it. \n[91]Thank you, Nyota. \n[92]I have no comment on the matter. \n[93]I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of Suus Mahna. \n[94]I am unable to meld with these Romulans -- there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate -- \n[95]What you refer to as the \"Red Matter Device\" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike. \n[96]Unknown. \n[97]Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design. \n[98]Computer: what is your manufacturing origin? \n[99]It appears you've been keeping rather important information from me. \n[100]Under authority granted me by the Europa convention, I'm confiscating this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel. No terms. No deals. \n[101]Last warning: unconditional surrender or you will be destroyed. \n[102]Computer, prepare self destruct sequence. \n[103]Captain -- what are you doing? \n[104]No, not really, not this time. \n[105]Father...? \n[106]... Fascinating. \n[107]Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could've explained the truth? \n[108]... it was a test? \n[109]How did you persuade him to keep your secret? \n[110]You lied. \n[111]A gamble... \n[112]The future's not what it used to be... in the face of extinction, it's only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race. \n[113]My future cannot be determined by your past. We are one, but not the same. \n[114]Permission to come aboard, Captain. \n[115]As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I can provide character references. ", "SPOCK PRIME": "\n[1]... Jim? \n[2]How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence? \n[3]I have been... and always shall be... your friend. \n[4]You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 -- \n[5]... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know. \n[6]It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. ... especially after the events of today. \n[7]Mutiny?   You are not the Captain? \n[8]... by Nero. \n[9]... he is a remarkably... \n[10]troubled Romulan. ... Please. Allow me -- it will be easier-- \n[11]Our minds... one and together...One hundred and twenty-seven years from now everything ends. \n[12]A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything. \n[13]I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it. \n[14]We built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova. A black hole. \n[15]I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I would not return. \n[16]My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical. \n[17]Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue. \n[18]Nero came after me. Determined to thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said... all planets should share its fate. \n[19]I needed an exit. I knew if this mission failed... everyone, everywhere... would lose everything. \n[20]I realized: a large black hole could destroy the supernova. A smaller one... could be my escape. Could send me back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black hole... \n[21]Nero must have understood what I was trying to do. Because he began racing for it. \n[22]Nero simply got to it first. How long I was travelling... I couldn't tell you. It was timeless. But when I arrived... \n[23]Nero was waiting for me. \n[24]Forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld. \n[25]\"Cthia\" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan. \n[26]Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. Tell me about the rest of the crew? Chekov-- Uhura --? \n[27]-- Sulu -- \n[28]Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose. \n[29]Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage. We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here. \n[30]... yes. You often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet. \n[31]You should know. He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise. \n[32]A ship we must return you to as soon as possible. \n[33]Are you the station chief? \n[34]... Fascinating. \n[35]You're Montgomery Scott. \n[36]You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming. \n[37]What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium? \n[38]The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet. \n[39]Allow us access to your shuttle... and I will show you what a genius you actually are. \n[40]Your equation for achieving trans-warp beaming. \n[41]Point of fact: it did occur to you. Extrapolating Enterprise's course -- \n[42]Now's your chance, Mr. Scott. \n[43]Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks -- \n[44]No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path. \n[45]Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship. \n[46]Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command. \n[47]Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell you.  I am emotionally compromised.

It was that balance between us -- I should say you and Kirk -- that often made the impossible, possible. \n[53]I'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize. \n[54]I inferred universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise. \n[55]I implied. \n[56]An act of faith. One I hope you'll repeat in the future. \n[57]And yet, you are in a unique position... you can be in two places at once. \n[58]I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony, and assist in the foundation of a new science academy. \n[59]Then I ask that you do yourself a favor. Put away logic. Do what feels right. The world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone. \n[60]As my customary farewell would appear oddly self serving, I will simply say... good luck. \n[61]Then I ask that you do yourself a favor... put away logic, and do what feels right.

Something I admired about your dad... he didn't believe in no-win scenarios. \n[5]Depends on how you define winning. You're here, aren't you? That instinct to leap without looking-- that was his nature, too. And in my opinion it's something Starfleet has lost. We're admirable, respectable. But overly-disciplined. Those cadets you took on, they'll make competent officers -- but you can bet your ass they'll run home to momma the minute they're looking down the barrel of a Klingon phaser cannon. \n[6]I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor.

His name was \"Spock\". \n[6]Your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm. \n[7]The child has your eyes. \n[8]In marriage... conflict is... \n[9]Natural. Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us... that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose. \n[10]Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you. \n[11]As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical. Spock.
