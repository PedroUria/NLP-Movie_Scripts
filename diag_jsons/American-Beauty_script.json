{"dialogues": {"LESTER": "\n[1]My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead. \n[2]Of course, I don't know that yet. He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day. \n[3]Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This will be the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here. \n[4]That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident. \n[5]That's our next-door neighbor Jim. \n[6]Man. I get exhausted just watching her. \n[7]My daughter Jane. Only child. \n[8]Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right. \n[9]I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back. \n[10]Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number... \n[11]It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you! \n[12]For you, Brad? I've got five. \n[13]Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right? \n[14]Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months? \n[15]That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him! \n[16]Who's expendable. \n[17]I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month? \n[18]You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist? \n[19]Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way. \n[20]Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore. \n[21]So Janie, how was school? \n[22]Just okay? \n[23]Well, you want to know how things went at my job today? \n[24]They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us-- --you couldn't possibly care any less, could you? \n[25]Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee. \n[26]I'm going to get some ice cream. \n[27]Honey, I'm sorry. I... \n[28]I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just... I'm... \n[29]You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you... \n[30]I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals. \n[31]What makes you so sure she wants us to be there? Did she ask us to come? \n[32]Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT. \n[33]Growing? She hates me. \n[34]She hates you too. \n[35]We can leave right after this, right? \n[36]Janie! \n[37]Congratulations, honey, you were great. \n[38]Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad. \n[39]Okay, good to meet you. You were also good tonight. Very... precise. \n[40]So, what are you girls doing now? \n[41]Oh really, do you need a ride? We can give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna come with us? \n[42]Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great! That's great, because Janie's thinking about getting a car soon too, aren't you, honey? \n[43]Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a friend of mine. \n[44]Well... I'll be seeing you around then. \n[45]It's the weirdest thing. \n[46]I feel like I've been in a coma for about twenty years, and I'm just now waking up. \n[47]Spec-tac-ular. \n[48]Well, you always end up ignoring me and going off-- \n[49]Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda. \n[50]I am happy, honey. \n[51]Oh, we've met before, actually. This thing last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton. \n[52]It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either. \n[53]All right, honey. I won't be weird. I'll be whatever you want me to be. \n[54]We have a very healthy relationship. \n[55]Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink. \n[56]Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy. \n[57]Yeah. \n[58]Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham. \n[59]Excuse me? \n[60]...did you ever see that movie, where the body's walking around holding its own head? And then the head goes down on that babe? \n[61]I think you just became my personal hero. Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen? \n[62]Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky Fitts. \n[63]With Jane? Really? \n[64]Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing. \n[65]Sure! \n[66]Shit. Shit! \n[67]Nothing. \n[68]I was not. \n[69]All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off. \n[70]That's right. I was choking the bishop. Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my monster. \n[71]Well, excuse me, but I still have blood pumping through my veins! \n[72]Really? I'm the only one who seems to be doing anything about it. \n[73]This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department. \n[74]I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm ready. \n[75]On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours. \n[76]Turn out the light when you come to bed, okay? \n[77]It's a great thing when you realize you still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else you can do that you've forgotten about. \n[78]Hey! You guys! \n[79]Well, I just started. \n[80]I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast. \n[81]I want to look good naked. \n[82]Hey! Yo! Ricky! My entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat. \n[83]Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next door. We haven't met. \n[84]Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir. \n[85]So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked about... \n[86]Yeah! \n[87]Sure. \n[88]What is this? \n[89]Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night. \n[90]You like Pink Floyd? \n[91]Man, I haven't listened to this album in years. \n[92]I don't know, it's been a while. How much is an ounce? \n[93]Wow. \n[94]Is that what we smoked last night? \n[95]How much? \n[96]Jesus. Things have changed since 1973. \n[97]Thanks. \n[98]Well, now I know how you can afford all this equipment. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track. \n[99]No actually, it was great. All I did was party and get laid. I had my whole life ahead of me... \n[100]Uh-oh, mom's mad. \n[101]Bench presses. I'm going to wail on my pecs, and then I'm going to do my back. \n[102]You're one to talk, you bloodless, money- grubbing freak. \n[103]Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here. Unless you want to spot me. \n[104]That's. What. You. Think. \n[105]Brad, for fourteen years I've been a whore for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if I start firebombing. \n[106]Well, just what sort of severance package is \"management\" prepared to offer me? \n[107]Considering the information I have about our editorial director buying pussy with company money. \n[108]Which I'm sure would interest the I.R.S., since it technically constitutes fraud. And I'm sure that some of our advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well. Not to mention, Craig's wife. \n[109]One year's salary, with benefits. \n[110]Well, what do you say I throw in a little sexual harassment charge to boot? \n[111]Against you. \n[112]Can you prove you didn't offer to save my job if I'd let you blow me? \n[113]Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose. \n[114]Yeah! \n[115]\n[116]What? \n[117]Uh... no. But thank you. I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley fries, and an orange soda. \n[118]No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out an application. \n[119]Good. I'm looking for the least possible amount of responsibility. \n[120]I have fast food experience. \n[121]Well, I'm sure there have been amazing technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of training process. It seems unfair to presume I won't be able to learn. \n[122]Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus. \n[123]And your mother seems to prefer I go through life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar under the sink. \n[124]Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like, \"Oops, where'd my job go?\" I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus. \n[125]I already have a job. \n[126]Will someone pass me the fucking asparagus? \n[127]Sit down. \n[128]I'm sick and tired of being treated    like I don't exist. You two do whatever    you want to do whenever you want to do    it and I don't complain. All I want is the    same courtesy-- \n[129]Don't interrupt me, honey. \n[130]Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're going to alternate our dinner music. Because frankly, and I don't think I'm alone here, I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit. \n[131]What? \n[132]Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I always wanted and now I have it. I rule! \n[133]I traded it in. \n[134]Hmm, let me think... No. You never drove it. Have you done something different? You look great. \n[135]Jane not home. We have the whole house to ourselves. \n[136]Christ, Carolyn. When did you become so... joyless? \n[137]Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I haven't. \n[138]So what? It's just a couch. \n[139]It's just a couch! \n[140]This isn't life. This is just stuff. And it's become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that's just nuts. \n[141]I'm only trying to help you. \n[142]Remember those posters that said, \"Today is the first day of the rest of your life?\" Well, that's true of every day except one. The day you die. \n[143]What? \n[144]What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her. \n[145]You better watch yourself, Janie, or you're going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother. \n[146]Fuck. \n[147]Yo, Ricky. How's it going? \n[148]You need more than that, my little hombre. \n[149]Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's! \n[150]Would you like to    try our new beef and cheese pot pie on    a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a    limited time only? \n[151]Her husband. We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time. \n[152]Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf. So. This makes sense. \n[153]Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy. Would you like Smiley Sauce with that? \n[154]Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do. Ever again. \n[155]Shit. \n[156]Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there. You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. \"No I can't. Really. Okay.\" \n[157]Oh. Hi. \n[158]Don't know. \n[159]Hi. \n[160]Some. \n[161]You like muscles? \n[162]Jesus, man. You're soaked. \n[163]You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's room. \n[164]You okay? \n[165]Uh... I don't know. Probably out fucking that dorky prince of real estate asshole. And you know what? I don't care. \n[166]Nope, our marriage is just for show. A commercial, for how normal we are. When we are anything but. \n[167]You're shaking. \n[168]We really should get you out of these clothes. \n[169]It's okay. \n[170]Just tell me what you need. \n[171]Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. You got the wrong idea. \n[172]Not at all. Bad night? \n[173]Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any stranger than mine. \n[174]Do you want a sip? \n[175]So... are you going to tell me? What you want? \n[176]You don't know? \n[177]Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted you since the first moment I saw you. You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. \n[178]You couldn't be ordinary if you tried. \n[179]You're kidding. \n[180]You are beautiful. \n[181]You are so beautiful... and I would be a very lucky man... \n[182]Don't. \n[183]You have nothing to be sorry about. \n[184]It's okay. Everything's okay. \n[185]Do you want me to make you another one? \n[186]You sure? \n[187]How's Jane? \n[188]I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is she miserable? I'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it. \n[189]Good for her. \n[190]God, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that. I'm great. \n[191]I'm great. \n[192]Man oh man... Man oh man oh man... \n[193]I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die. \n[194]First of all, that one second isn't a second at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time... \n[195]For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp, watching falling stars... \n[196]And yellow leaves, from the maple trees, that lined my street... \n[197]Or my grandmother's hands, and the way her skin seemed like paper... \n[198]And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's brand new Firebird... \n[199]And Janie... \n[200]And Janie... \n[201]And... Carolyn. \n[202]I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... \n[203]...and then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... ", "RICKY": "\n[1]Want me to kill him for you? \n[2]Be right there. \n[3]Mom. \n[4]I don't eat bacon, remember? \n[5]What's new in the world, Dad? \n[6]That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't feel like it's anything to be ashamed of. \n[7]Yeah, you're right. \n[8]Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out. \n[9]Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you. \n[10]I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting. \n[11]I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious. \n[12]Hey. \n[13]Mom. Nobody said anything. \n[14]Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door? \n[15]I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house next to you. \n[16]Hi, Lester Burnham. \n[17]Do you party? \n[18]Do you get high? \n[19]Re-Animator. \n[20]Fine. So don't pay me. \n[21]I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone. \n[22]Eighteen. I just do these gigs as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job. \n[23]I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the house next to you. I go to school with your daughter. \n[24]Yeah. Jane. \n[25]Any time. \n[26]Lester. If you want any more, you know where I live. \n[27]Welcome to America's Weirdest Home Videos. \n[28]Coming, Dad. \n[29]I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up? \n[30]Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz. \n[31]Re-Animator. \n[32]You want to borrow it? Okay, it's up in my room. Come on. \n[33]Can you hold this for a sec? \n[34]I don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know. \n[35]Urine. I have to take a drug test every six months to make sure I'm clean. \n[36]It's not mine. One of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss. \n[37]I like a lot of music. \n[38]How much do you want? \n[39]Well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred. \n[40]But this shit is top of the line. It's called G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent. But a completely mellow high, no paranoia. \n[41]This is all I ever smoke. \n[42]Two grand. \n[43]You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it. \n[44]There's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash. \n[45]That sucks. \n[46]My dad thinks I pay for all this with catering jobs. Never underestimate the power of denial. \n[47]I was filming this dead bird. \n[48]Because it's beautiful. \n[49]Hi, Jane. \n[50]Okay. \n[51]It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks. \n[52]I like it. \n[53]Have you ever known anybody who died? \n[54]No, but I did see this homeless woman who froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked really sad. \n[55]I got that homeless woman on video. \n[56]Because it was amazing. \n[57]When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back. \n[58]Beauty. \n[59]Mom, I want you to meet somebody. Mom. \n[60]I want you to meet somebody. This is Jane. \n[61]This is where my dad hides out. \n[62]You got to see this one thing... \n[63]My dad would kill me if he knew I was in here. \n[64]No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade. \n[65]Turn it over. \n[66]It's like official state china of the Third Reich. There's a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit. But my dad just has this one thing. \n[67]What's wrong? \n[68]No, you're scared of me. \n[69]You want to see the most beautiful thing I've ever filmed? \n[70]It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever. \n[71]Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... \n[72]Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in. \n[73]No, sir. I won't fight you. \n[74]I picked the lock, sir. \n[75]No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your Nazi plate. \n[76]Yes, sir. She lives next door. \n[77]Her name's Jane. \n[78]Sir, I'm sorry. \n[79]Yes, sir. \n[80]Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to teach me. Don't give up on me, Dad. \n[81]Why? \n[82]I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are. \n[83]Fine. \n[84]I am naked. \n[85]When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off. That's when my dad put me in the hospital. Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years. \n[86]He's not a bad man. \n[87]Why? \n[88]You'd rather he had the crush on you? \n[89]How? \n[90]Want me to kill him for you? \n[91]It'll cost you. \n[92]You know, that's not a very nice thing to do, hiring somebody to kill your dad. \n[93]Of course. \n[94]Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other? \n[95]Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go in with Jane and her mom. \n[96]Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham. \n[97]I have to run next door. Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework. \n[98]You got any papers? \n[99]You should learn to roll a joint. \n[100]From my job. \n[101]You were watching me? \n[102]Dad, you don't really think... me and Mr. Burnham? \n[103]Jesus, what is with you-- \n[104]You mean that? \n[105]You're right. I suck dick for money. \n[106]Two thousand dollars. I'm that good. \n[107]And you should see me fuck. I'm the best piece of ass in three states. \n[108]What a sad old man you are. \n[109]Mom, I'm leaving. \n[110]I wish things would have been better for you. Take care of Dad. \n[111]It's me. \n[112]If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me? \n[113]If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight. Would you come with me? \n[114]We won't have to. I have over forty thousand dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up. \n[115]Yes. \n[116]She's not your friend. She's somebody you use to feel better about yourself. \n[117]Yes, you are. And you're boring. And you're totally ordinary. And you know it. \n[118]I don't get scared. \n[119]Mine won't. \n[120]Wow. ", "JANE": "\n[1]I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. \n[2]Yeah, would you? \n[3]Yes. \n[4]Nice going, Dad. \n[5]Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music? \n[6]It was okay. \n[7]No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular. \n[8]Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day. \n[9]I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months. \n[10]Oh, great. So now it's my fault? \n[11]My parents are coming tonight. They're trying to, you know, take an active interest in me. \n[12]They're such assholes. Why can't they just have their own lives? \n[13]Oh shit, they're still here. \n[14]I didn't win anything. \n[15]This is my friend, Angela Hayes. \n[16]Dad. \n[17]Dad. Mom's waiting for you. \n[18]Could he be any more pathetic? \n[19]I'm sorry my dad was so weird tonight. \n[20]Vomit. \n[21]I really think it'll happen for you. \n[22]Asshole. \n[23]Hello? \n[24]I didn't. \n[25]I was in the shower. \n[26]Oh, gross. \n[27]Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night. \n[28]You know him? \n[29]Why? What did he do? \n[30]Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things. \n[31]What? Please. \n[32]Shut up. \n[33]I know. I kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night? \n[34]Thanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now. \n[35]He's like, so confident. That can't be real. \n[36]Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go up to my room. \n[37]Mom, you remember Angela. \n[38]I forgot to tell you, she's spending the night. Is that okay? \n[39]I'm sorry about my dad. \n[40]Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who wants to jump your bones. But to me... he's just too embarrassing to live. \n[41]Shut up. \n[42]Shut up. \n[43]You are so grossing me out right now. \n[44]Yeah, it was the sound of you being a huge disgusting pig. \n[45]Shit. I bet he's filming us right now. \n[46]Look. I want you to stop filming me. \n[47]Do you need a ride? \n[48]I think I'm going to walk, too. \n[49]So how do you like your new house? \n[50]The people who used to live there fed these stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And then she cut down their tree. \n[51]No. Have you? \n[52]Why would you film that? \n[53]What was amazing about it? \n[54]And what do you see? \n[55]Hi. \n[56]I take it he's got a thing for guns. \n[57]Did you steal his keys? \n[58]Oh my God. \n[59]Nothing. \n[60]No I'm not. \n[61]Oh my God. What time is it? \n[62]Sorry I'm late. \n[63]Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this-- \n[64]Go. Away. \n[65]Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are? \n[66]Aw, Christ, Mom. \n[67]Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay? \n[68]Don't. \n[69]It's weird, watching myself. I don't like how I look. \n[70]I'm not going to sit here for that shit. \n[71]Ha. How does it feel now? \n[72]You don't feel naked? \n[73]You know what I mean. \n[74]Tell me about being in the hospital. \n[75]Wow. You must really hate him. \n[76]Well... you better believe I'd hate my father if he did something like that to me. Wait. I do hate my father. \n[77]He's a total asshole and he's got this crush on my friend Angela and it's disgusting. \n[78]Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near as important to him as she is. \n[79]I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong. He's doing massive psychological damage to me. \n[80]Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline. \n[81]I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery. \n[82]Yeah, would you? \n[83]Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was about ten. I've got almost three thousand dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for a boob job. \n[84]But my tits can wait, huh? \n[85]Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I? \n[86]You know I'm not serious, right? \n[87]Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight? \n[88]I've been too embarrassed to bring her over. Because of you, and the way that you behave. \n[89]Dad! You stare at her all the time, like you're drunk! It's disgusting! \n[90]No. \n[91]Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay? It's not like that. \n[92]Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all that. \n[93]Where's Mom? \n[94]I don't think we could be friends anymore. \n[95]Just don't fuck my dad, all right? Please? \n[96]Dad! Leave us alone! \n[97]What? \n[98]Yes. \n[99]I'm no more a kid than you are! We can use my plastic surgery money. \n[100]Why do you even care? \n[101]You shut up, bitch! \n[102]Well, then so am I! And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people. And you'll never be a freak because you're just too perfect. \n[103]Are you scared? \n[104]My parents will try to find me. \n[105]Oh God. ", "CAROLYN": "\n[1]Good morning, Jim! \n[2]I just love your tie! That color! \n[3]Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow. \n[4]Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look unattractive? \n[5]Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably. \n[6]Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough. \n[7]--there is no decision, you just write the damn thing! \n[8]Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed. \n[9]Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh? \n[10]So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of-- --\"The Real Estate King,\" that house would never have sat on the market for six months. \n[11]Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was. \n[12]No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like. \n[13]What?! \n[14]What? \n[15]I will sell this house today. \n[16]I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. I will sell this house today. \n[17]I will sell this house today. \n[18]Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham! \n[19]This living room is very dramatic. Wait 'til you see the native stone fireplace! \n[20]A simple cream would really lighten things up. You could even put in a skylight. \n[21]Well, why don't we go into the kitchen? \n[22]It's a dream come true for any cook. Just filled with positive energy. Huh? \n[23]...and you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan can cut down on your energy costs. \n[24]You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here. \n[25]What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape architect. Solved. \n[26]I have some tiki torches in the garage. \n[27]Shut up. Stop it. You... Weak! \n[28]Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! \n[29]Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her. But she's been practicing her steps for weeks. \n[30]Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane. \n[31]She's just willful. \n[32]Hi! I really enjoyed that! \n[33]Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn't screw up once. Okay, we have to go. \n[34]--everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no one? \n[35]Now listen to me. This is an important business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image-- \n[36]Hi, Shirley! Listen, just do me a favor. Act happy tonight? \n[37]Oh! Buddy! \n[38]Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you again. \n[39]Carolyn. \n[40]Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy. \n[41]My husband, Lester-- \n[42]Honey. Don't be weird. \n[43]You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but... I am in complete awe of you. I mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. You know, I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the \"competition,\" but... I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you... \n[44]Really? \n[45]I'll do that. Thank you. \n[46]Lester? \n[47]What are you doing? \n[48]Hi. I'm ready to go. I'll meet you out front. \n[49]Yes, of course! \n[50]What are you doing? \n[51]You were masturbating. \n[52]Yes, you were. \n[53]That's disgusting. \n[54]So do I! \n[55]Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage. \n[56]Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated? \n[57]Do not mess with me, mister, or I will divorce you so fast it'll make your head spin! \n[58]What the hell do you think you're doing? \n[59]I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so glad. I think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example to set for our daughter. \n[60]Lester. You have such hostility in you! \n[61]You will not get away with this. You can be sure of that! \n[62]Buddy. \n[63]What's she doing in New York? \n[64]Buddy. I'm so sorry. \n[65]When I saw you two at the party the other night, you seemed perfectly happy. \n[66]Yes! Oh, God! I love it! \n[67]Oh yes! I love it! Fuck me, your majesty! \n[68]That was exactly what I needed. The royal treatment, so to speak. \n[69]I was so stressed out. \n[70]What? \n[71]Really. \n[72]I've never fired a gun before. \n[73]No, no, that's quite all right, dear. Your father and I were just discussing his day at work. Why don't you tell our daughter about it, honey? \n[74]Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of. \n[75]How dare you speak to me that way in front of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same day that you lose your job! \n[76]Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now-- \n[77]No, no, don't give a second thought as to who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn. You mean, you're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't mind. I really don't. You mean, everything? You don't mind having the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his job-- \n[78]Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don't complain. What is this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating? That's the only explanation I can think of-- \n[79]Honey, please let me in. \n[80]I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight. But in a way, I'm glad. \n[81]Me? \n[82]No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself. You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better. \n[83]You ungrateful little brat. Just look at everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have our own house. \n[84]Well, all I know is... I love shooting this gun! \n[85]Ah, whose car is that out front? \n[86]Where's the Camry? \n[87]Shouldn't you have consulted me first? \n[88]Where's Jane? \n[89]Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy in my life. \n[90]Lester. You're going to spill beer on the couch. \n[91]This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not \"just a couch.\" \n[92]Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important appointment-- \n[93]Well, of course, she's always welcome. You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while. \n[94]What's good here? \n[95]Then I guess we'll just have to be bad, won't we? I think I'll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla shake. \n[96]I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning. \n[97]We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my-- \n[98]You know, this really doesn't concern you. \n[99]Oh, Lester-- \n[100]Lester, just stop it! \n[101]Oh, no. I understand completely. In order to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all times. \n[102]Stop it. Stop it! \n[103]I refuse to be a victim. \n[104]I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a victim... Lester, I have something I have to say to you... ", "ANGELA": "\n[1]Who are you looking for? \n[2]Gross. I hate it when my mom does that. \n[3]Oh. Hi. \n[4]Thanks. \n[5]We're going out for pizza. \n[6]Thanks... but I have a car. \n[7]I think it's sweet. And I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time. \n[8]It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about twelve, I'd go out to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking. Just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off. \n[9]No, I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary. \n[10]Oh, I know. Because everything that was meant to happen, does. Eventually. \n[11]Hello? Hello? \n[12]Why'd you call me? \n[13]Well, my phone just rang and I answered it and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you back. \n[14]I'm serious, he just pulled down his pants and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy. \n[15]It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool. \n[16]Of course I did. He is a really well- known photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down. \n[17]Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick. \n[18]Cunt! I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me. \n[19]Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic. \n[20]Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution. \n[21]What do you mean? \n[22]You total slut. You've got a crush on him. \n[23]You were defending him! You love him. You want to have like, ten thousand of his babies. \n[24]What a freak. And why does he dress like a Bible salesman? \n[25]I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't even like, look at me once. \n[26]I should say hi to your dad. I don't want to be rude. \n[27]Nice suit. \n[28]You're looking good, Mr. Burnham. \n[29]Last time I saw you, you looked kind of wound up. Ooh, is that root beer? \n[30]I love root beer, don't you? \n[31]Don't be. I think it's funny. \n[32]Your mom's the one who's embarrassing. What a phony. \n[33]Your dad's actually kind of cute. \n[34]He is. If he just worked out a little, he'd be hot. \n[35]Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick. \n[36]If he built up his chest and arms, I would totally fuck him. \n[37]I would! I would suck your dad's big fat dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his eyes rolled back in his head! What was that noise? Jane. \n[38]I'm serious. \n[39]See? \n[40]Oh my God. Jane. \n[41]It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff? \n[42]Really? \n[43]I've been waiting for you. \n[44]You've been working out, haven't you? I can tell. \n[45]I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty. \n[46]What are you doing? \n[47]Why? \n[48]I think maybe you forgot your medication today, mental boy. \n[49]Well, whatever. This is boring. Let's go. \n[50]Are you crazy? I don't want to end up hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere. \n[51]Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway. C'mon, let's go. \n[52]What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile. \n[53]So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a regular basis now, right? \n[54]Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick? \n[55]Not like what? Doesn't he have one? Why don't you want to talk about it? I mean, I tell you every single detail about every guy that I fuck. \n[56]Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you're like, above it? We gotta get you a real man. \n[57]Hi, Mr. Burnham. \n[58]Wow. Look at you. Have you been working out? \n[59]You can really tell. Look at those arms. \n[60]I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to. \n[61]You are way too uptight about sex. \n[62]Why not? \n[63]You guys can't be serious. You're just a kid. And he's like, a mental case. You'll end up living in a box on the street. \n[64]What, other drug dealers? \n[65]Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him. \n[66]Because you're my friend! \n[67]Go fuck yourself, psycho! \n[68]Jane! He is a freak! \n[69]Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly. \n[70]You two deserve each other. \n[71]I hope you don't mind if I play the stereo. \n[72]Not really bad, just... strange. \n[73]Jane and I had a fight. It was about you. \n[74]She's mad at me because I said I think you're sexy. \n[75]I don't know. \n[76]What do you want? \n[77]You don't think I'm ordinary? \n[78]Thank you. I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary... \n[79]This is my first time. \n[80]I'm sorry. \n[81]I still want to do it... I just thought I should tell you... in case you wondered why I wasn't... better. \n[82]What's wrong? I thought you said I was beautiful. \n[83]I feel so stupid. \n[84]I'm sorry. \n[85]Wow. I was starving. \n[86]No, no, no. I'm fine. \n[87]I mean, I'm still a little weirded out, but... ...I feel better. Thanks. \n[88]What do you mean? \n[89]She's... she's really happy.
