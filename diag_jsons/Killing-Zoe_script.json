{"dialogues": {"ERIC": "\n[1]Hey you madman! \n[2]What happened to you?  I thought you were going to call. \n[3]Oh I see.  You have been busy. \n[4]That's good, but now I am here.  So let's go.  We have a lot to talk about. \n[5]Is she your girlfriend? \n[6]Fuck her. \n[7]She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out. \n[8]Don't be silly.  It's dangerous. \n[9][Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time for you to leave.] \n[10][No.  Come on you fucking slut!] \n[11]Don't worry about her. [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!] \n[12]God damn it! \n[13][Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore!] \n[14]God damn it.  Look at my hand. \n[15]Oh shit.  Her clothes. \n[16]La ferme! \n[17]So tell me, what have you been up to? \n[18]Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me. \n[19]Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores.  A girl like that will give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs? \n[20]Just use your hand like me. \n[21]I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys. \n[22]No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking.  It will make them respect you. \n[23]Just put on a shirt and a sport coat. \n[24]I'm glad you came.  How long has it been? \n[25]It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.  Now here. \n[26]But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came.  That's good. \n[27]You would have been stupid to. \n[28]After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy.  And then I bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The newspaper. \n[29]Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris.  You know, like terrorists. \n[30]It's fun. \n[31]The people next door are on holiday.  We took their phone.  If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead. \n[32]I don't know.  I think it's asleep but it's been there for days. \n[33]I guess it is dead. \n[34]Hello. \n[35]Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude.  Got it? \n[36]They all know who you are. Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres. \n[37]Don't sit next to that junkie. \n[38]That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time he's out the door. Zed, come here. \n[39]Don't ask me where we got this. \n[40]On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed. \n[41]But this one.  BIP.  The Banque Internationale de Paris.  And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes? \n[42]We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this. \n[43]As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. The concierge, at this desk. We will take care of him.  Then we can close the bank.  No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed. \n[44]Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him.  Don't worry about that. \n[45]Here.  This is where they keep the days reserve cash.  Okay fuck that. \n[46]There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into.  This is where the real prize is. \n[47]Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber. \n[48]No, that's too long. \n[49]Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be in and out. Like that.  Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and... \n[50]Another vault. \n[51]I don't know...it connects the two vaults. \n[52]Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon. \n[53]I don't know. \n[54]But this entry way is too small to get the platen out.  We have a lot of merchandise in there. \n[55]You could open it in five minutes? \n[56]Hot damn.  That is our answer. \n[57]Tomorrow. \n[58]But of course. \n[59]It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what to do. \n[60]You don't need to know shit.  Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest. \n[61]Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we live life.  It's better that way.  Okay? \n[62]Good.  Now we do heroin! \n[63][Cotton.] \n[64][Here, shut up and hold this.] \n[65][Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.] \n[66][Hold my arm.] My vein is like a rock. \n[67]There.  That's Notre Dame. \n[68]Up here you can see the Eiffel tower. \n[69]Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history.  And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo. \n[70]Watch it!  Don't crash my car. \n[71]Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves.  Do you see? \n[72]Suce ma bite?! \n[73]This is good to have you here.  We could not do this without you. \n[74]Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.  That's good. \n[75]You know I have AIDS.  From the needle. \n[76]Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe. \n[77]I'm glad you came.  How long has it been? \n[78]It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.

And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut.] \n[134][Any others I should worry about?] \n[135][Well, just to be sure--] \n[136][Who the fuck are you?] \n[137][Making a deposit I hope.] [Bring him with us.] \n[138][Shut your fucking mouths!] \n[139][You think we're fucking amateurs?  You think we're stupid?  I've got news for you...we planned ahead my friend!] \n[140][Now save us a lot of time and just open the vault.] \n[141][Okay.] \n[142][Open the vault.] \n[143][Oh.] [Can you?] \n[144][Then open it.] \n[145][Do you understand that I'll kill her if you don't open this fucking vault?] \n[146][Open the vault door or I'll kill this man next.] \n[147][Come on.  It's only things in there. This man is flesh and blood.] \n[148]Shut the fuck up! [You're a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you.  Do you have a family?] \n[149][Would you like to see them again?] \n[150][This man has a family he would like to have Bastille day dinner with tonight. So save us some time and open the vault.] \n[151]Fucking idiot. [You seem like a nice man.  Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family.] \n[152][Take him upstairs.] \n[153]Don't you ever conflict with me during work again!  Do you hear!? \n[154]Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were in charge now.  Nobody told me. If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour. \n[155]Oh fuck it doesn't matter!  Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank. \n[156]Ohhhh!  That's what they tell you!  But who cares?  I need to take a piss. \n[157]Why don't you open the vault? \n[158]What is it?  What's going on? \n[159]No!  You stay here. \n[160][What the fuck is going on!?] \n[161]Oh shit. \n[162][Is this what happens?  Is this what happens when I walk away for five minutes?] \n[163][He had a hidden gun.] [I don't care!] \n[164][I have had enough of this nonsense!  The next person that speaks will die!] \n[165][Good.  Let's try to keep it that way. God what a mess.] \n[166][What the fuck is it now!?  You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss?] \n[167][What?] \n[168][Yes.] \n[169][Yes.  It didn't go off.  If it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked.  But they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked.  So if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions I'll go downstairs and see if we're in yet.  Is that okay with you?] \n[170][I thought the phones were dead.] \n[171][Answer it!] \n[172][Answer it or you will die.] \n[173][Hello.] [Who is this?] \n[174][What do you want?] \n[175][We're all fine in here.] \n[176][No.  I'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig.  You send anyone near this building and I'll kill the first person I lay my hands on.  I've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.] [Just stay put.  We'll call you when we're ready.  In the mean time, have a nice day.] \n[177][Shut the fuck up!  The alarm didn't do shit.  For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here.  Anyhow it doesn't matter.  Nothing has changed.] \n[178][Nothing.  We don't have to do anything. The plan stays the same, just slightly different.] \n[179][If the police decide to come in...kill them.  And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else.  This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.] \n[180]Nothing.  They were just scaring them. \n[181]Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun. \n[182]It's okay.  You can buy another one. \n[183]Excellent.  What next? \n[184]It's okay.  I'll find it for you. \n[185]I think it would be better if I looked for you.  I could-- \n[186]Oh, I wouldn't want to do that. \n[187]Got it. \n[188]Ready! \n[189]It worked! \n[190]Oh my God it worked! \n[191]Then do it.  We don't have all day. \n[192]Good. \n[193]Merde! \n[194]Must be. \n[195]Me too. \n[196]Some asshole in the vault. \n[197]Quiet! \n[198]Just let me think. \n[199][Hey you.  Nice shooting.  Play time's over.  Why don't you throw out your gun?] \n[200][Come on.  We don't want to kill you.] \n[201]What is this guys problem? [Come on!  You're making me impatient.  I don't have all day.] \n[202][Then take a paid vacation.  We won't tell if you won't.] \n[203][Well, look, we're going to give you fifteen minutes to change your mind. Okay?] \n[204]I like danger. [Changed your mind yet?] \n[205]But I didn't!  Let's go check out the damage. \n[206]Zed look! \n[207]I beat you!  I opened it in under three minutes. \n[208]Look at it!  We're all rich! \n[209]We're rich! \n[210]We're rich! \n[211]Yes but we're rich! \n[212]I'm going to show the others. \n[213][Jean, Francois, Claude...look at this.] \n[214][Zed is opening the vault now.  This is a taste.] \n[215][Look at this and tell me I'm not brilliant.] \n[216][None of you are worth half of this single bar.  Remember that.] \n[217][Of course.] \n[218][There's no need.  I have nothing to hide.  What is it Claude?] \n[219][What are you doing Claude?  Talking of all this false doubt.  What do you think we're going to do?] \n[220][Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough.  And killing all these assholes-- ] [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of good now, is it?] \n[221][No.  Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane.] \n[222][Claude, you are a mental giant.  Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?] \n[223][I'm going to see how things are going.] \n[224][They want to fuck with me!?  They want to fuck with me!?] \n[225][You want to fuck with me!?  I'll show you what happens to people who fuck with me!] \n[226][The moment of truth my love.  You knew it would come.] \n[227][Have mercy?] \n[228][With her.] \n[229][That's sweet.] [You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he one of your clients?] \n[230][It's a deal.] \n[231][Don't mention it.] \n[232][Clearing up the \"how full of shit am I\" question the cops are asking themselves right now.] \n[233][Hello.] [Yes.  I'll hold.] [I'm holding.] \n[234][Hello.] [You don't know the fucking half of it. So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.] [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people.  Hear?] [No.  None of that.  We won't trade. That never works.  Not in the movies, not in real life.  Understand?  We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city.  And you're not going to follow us.] [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane?  Us?  No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you.  You're really pissing me off.  You think I'm a fucking amature?] \n[235][I fucking hate cops.] \n[236]Merde! \n[237][That's what you get!] \n[238][The fucking police won't budge.  I kill a man and they don't care.  They say they don't make deals with terrorists.  It really fucks up my plan.] \n[239][Claude, look around you.  We're not talking prison here.  You know.  The cops will give in.  You start killing women...they give in.  They're all so fucking much in love with women!] \n[240][What are you looking at you fucking whore?] \n[241][Are you afraid I'll tell these people that this is only a day job for you?] \n[242][What?  So they know that you're a--] \n[243][Shut up!] \n[244][My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with.] \n[245][You fucking bitch!] \n[246][Bitch!] \n[247]Kill her!  Kill her! \n[248]What the fuck are you doing!? \n[249]Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much?  She's really fucked with your mind. \n[250]Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke. The attention.  They have no idea of who they're dealing with.  They have no idea what kind of men we are. \n[251]You can no longer be in our club.  You forfeit your cut of the pie. \n[252]Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me. \n[253]Never let a girl come between two men. \n[254]Now let's try to get out of here. \n[255][Smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being.  You're beautiful.] \n[256][Jesus, what now?] \n[257][Get a hostage.] \n[258][Think!] \n[259]Zed. \n[260]What's your girlfriends name? \n[261]Zoe. [Zoe, come here to me.] \n[262][Killing you would just be gravy, so don't fuck with me.] \n[263]Zed no.  I'll kill you.  It means nothing to me, our friendship. \n[264]Oh but you're wrong.  This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass.  You find your own. \n[265]Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a sausage. \n[266]Did you see how she ran?  Did you see how she ran?  She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one.  What do you say Zed? \n[267]I will kill you.  And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here.  I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed? \n[268]Fucking bitch! \n[269]Fuck both of you. \n[270]Au revoir. \n[271]I give you little kiss.  Ciao. ", "ZED": "\n[1]Hotel Mondial. \n[2]I don't speak French. \n[3]That's right. \n[4]What time is it? \n[5]Yes. \n[6]I've been here once before.  When I was younger. \n[7]I beg your pardon? \n[8]No. Why? \n[9]Oh, wait. \n[10]What time is it? \n[11]Time. \n[12]Bonjour. \n[13]I...don't speak French. \n[14]Well, let me just dry up. \n[15]What's your name? \n[16]My name's Zed. \n[17]What was that? \n[18]I'd rather watch you get undressed first. \n[19]Slower. \n[20]Yes? \n[21]Yes. \n[22]Why? \n[23]Do you ask all your clients questions? \n[24]So you like me? \n[25]Why? \n[26]How do you know I'm a good person? \n[27]All men and women fit together.  Hell, even some men fit together. \n[28]No I don't. \n[29]I never really thought of it like that. \n[30]Well, I like you too Zoe. \n[31]Well, I like your honesty.  You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with. \n[32]Really?  Can I have my francs back then? \n[33]I see. \n[34]No, I do. \n[35]I didn't say it was. \n[36]Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go to? \n[37]That's really interesting.  What kind of art do you study? \n[38]Oh. \n[39]What kind of things do you paint? \n[40]I'd like to see one of these. \n[41]Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.  I didn't understand the difference. \n[42]If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me. \n[43]I have no idea.  Night time. \n[44]Eric.  Come in. \n[45]Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a wake up call. \n[46]What about the girl? \n[47]No. \n[48]I'll let her stay here tonight. \n[49]Eric. \n[50]Jesus Eric. \n[51]Eric, I liked that girl. \n[52]Because you were on a rampage. \n[53]Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it. \n[54]Sometimes you just need honesty...and security. \n[55]Okay, let me take a shower. \n[56]Oh. \n[57]Years. \n[58]Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states. \n[59]How could I resist your invitation? \n[60]So what have you been doing here? \n[61]Really? \n[62]Is that cat dead? \n[63]I will. \n[64]Thanks. \n[65]Thanks. \n[66]Okay. \n[67]Are you sure he won't push the alarm? \n[68]What kind of vault is that? \n[69]Caliber? It'll take three hours. \n[70]That's how long it'll take. \n[71]Well hold on a second. What's this? \n[72]No this. \n[73]Well, what kind of vault is this other one? \n[74]Why would those two vaults be connected? \n[75]Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.  Maybe less. \n[76]No, don't you see?  We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault.  From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes. \n[77]From the inside it's easy. \n[78]Okay.  When is Bastille day? \n[79]Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow? \n[80]It's impossible. \n[81]I don't know what to do. \n[82]I haven't even seen the bank. \n[83]Okay. \n[84]No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow. \n[85]I don't think so. \n[86]Yes. \n[87]Is tomorrow really Bastille day? \n[88]Really? \n[89]Well, Eric's mother is American. \n[90]They're divorced.  And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up.  So every six months he would come back to the states.  We were best friends.  Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been...years. \n[91]Well...I suppose.

When I tell you, open it up. \n[162]Right. \n[163]We're not out of here yet. \n[164]Are you still there? \n[165]Oliver, now!  Open the vault! \n[166]Open seasame. \n[167]Do you want to give me a hand? \n[168]Here, help me with this. \n[169]Just help me steer this out. \n[170]What for? \n[171]Money is too easily traceable.  You'd never be able to spend it.  And forget about exchanging it. \n[172]No sir.  Your best bet is to get these bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea. \n[173]Or Portugal. \n[174]Do we have a covering of some kind? \n[175]You know.  Something to cover this with. It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold. \n[176]Police?!  What do you mean they know what we're up too? \n[177]No I didn't know!

Which ever you like. \n[9]That's funny.  We both have Z names. \n[10]You can take those off.  The pants. \n[11]Alright. \n[12]Alright Mister America.  Zed. \n[13]Slow enough for you? \n[14]C'etait formidable. \n[15]I'm cold. \n[16]Zed? \n[17]Moises told me you were in town for business. \n[18]What kind of business? \n[19]I don't know.  I'm just curious. \n[20]No.  Just the ones I like. \n[21]Yes. \n[22]Because you're...a good person.  I run into some real creeps.  You know. \n[23]Body language.  We fit together. \n[24]No, but you know, we clicked.  You made me orgasm.  Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with? \n[25]Usually never.  They're almost always fat like pigs. \n[26]And you make me feel safe.  That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm. \n[27]Well, it's true. \n[28]Turn off the television. \n[29]So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much. \n[30]Honest? \n[31]Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can orgasm.  Even with his own hand. \n[32]I am not a prostitute! \n[33]I'm a student.  And to pay for the classes I became an escort.  It's my choice to sleep with you. \n[34]What?  You don't understand. \n[35]Hey, it's not easy. \n[36]I'm here because I want to. \n[37]The Centre du Art, Paris. \n[38]Not any of the old shit. \n[39]I have a day job too.  Three times a week. \n[40]But someday there will be only my art. \n[41]I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects. Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with no narrative.  I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.  Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny.  Those are left for me.  They belong only to me.  If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I would destroy it.  I don't care how much cash they would offer me.  It would be shit.  I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.  They told too much about me.  And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself.  The way I'm telling you. \n[42]What I do I do only for the objects. \n[43]What?  So you could see the work of a whore? \n[44]The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm. \n[45]If I do...you'll never know which one it is.  Because I'll be the only one who understands.  I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from. \n[46]What time is it? \n[47]I'm going to take a shower. \n[48][Fuck you.] \n[49][Let go of me you shit!!] \n[50][Give me my clothes you asshole!] \n[51]Ouvres!

Shave my ass!] \n[57]No! \n[58][I work here.  This man is a customer...he needs medical help.] \n[59]The hospital? \n[60]Come on.  I have a car. \n[61]We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there. Do you feel pain? \n[62]I have a shower.  You can clean up there. \n[63]My name is not Zoe.  Not any more. \n[64]You'll get well.  Then I'll show you the real Paris.
