You trying to kill us? \n[8]I can't understand it. I just had this thing in for a tune-up. \n[9]And I just had 'em tune up the whole thing yesterday. \n[10]Might not be too bad. \n[11]Actually, it might be very nice. \n[12]-Which is exactly why they don't know. I'll tell you who I am gonna call. The guys that fixed up this car. \n[13]Hey, I think this is where we get off. \n[14]I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up. but I'm just not paying for it. \n[15]What're you drawing Cheryl? \n[16]Is it a bible? \n[17]He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them. LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison. \n[18]like it. \n[19]You better get washed up. I'll see ya in there. \n[20]I'd like to make a toast for all here this evening.

You just don't know when you're carrying something too far. \n[36]No. It's not Scott. Scotty's okay. It's just that ever since we came up here, things have been a little too tense.  All these crazy things going on. And look at that window- we're gonna have to pay for that window now. \n[37]I hope so. \n[38]What'ya say we stay up for a while and listen to the storm. \n[39]eh? It's for you. \n[40]going to give it to you before we left, but things got so hectic, this is the first chance I've had. Do you like it? \n[41]Cheryl what's wrong with you? Did something in the woods do this to you? \n[42]Cheryl, there's nothing out there. Trees do not attack people. \n[43]Sure, sure I'll drive you into town. But if you'll just listen to what you're saying, you- \n[44]Okay- if you don't want to stay, I can't make you. \n[45]He is listening intently to the log as it continues. \n[46]you do it Linda? \n[47]Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here! \n[48]Hurry! \n[49]SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond. \n[50]We've still got a few hours before morning. \n[51]I don't know. \n[52]No...no...no... \n[53]Uh...Scott. \n[54]What is uh...what are we gonna do? \n[55]You...can't bury Shelly. She's a friend of ours isn't she? \n[56]-Or if it's even still in tact. \n[57]I will. Do you have everything? \n[58]Listen...Scotty...I'm sorry about falling apart like that when- \n[59]You're a good man. \n[60]It's me Linda. \n[61]You did baby? \n[62]Yeah. Fine. \n[63]Yeah, sure. She's sleeping that's all. \n[64]Get some rest. \n[65]Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be just fine- you'll see. \n[66]You'll see. \n[67]We're not gonna die! \n[68]We're not gonna die! We're not gonna die! We're getting out of here! Now listen to me- is there a way around the chasm. \n[69]Scotty. Scott! \n[70]Scott, is there some way around the chasm? \n[71]Scott, listen to me please, for God's sake. Is there a way around the chasm? \n[72]Shut up! \n[73]God forgive me Linda. \n[74]\n[75]Cheryl? \n[76]Cheryl? \n[77]You bastards! Why are you doing this? Why? \n[78]Oh...Linda. \n[79]Scott, I can't.

I'd lose my mind. \n[80]You'll get better- you'll see. \n[81]Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be better and we'll both get out of here tomorrow. \n[82]No, that was only with Shelly. You had to with Shelly. You- Linda loves me. You're delirious- I...I'll get you some water. \n[83]Now, now the sun will be up in an hour or so and we'll get out of here ...together. You, me, Linda, Shelly- n-no not Shelly, she- we'll all go home together. Wouldn't you like to be going home? You'd like that I'd bet, wouldn't ya? \n[84]...Scott. \n[85]He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's body. \n[86]Stay back. \n[87]Linda please, if you can still hear me. Keep away. \n[88]Oh..... \n[89]The door... \n[90]I see that box of shells? \n[91]C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this? \n[92]The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion. CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and fires at her head.

Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead bodies- \n[23]cellar, dead bodies in the cellar... \n[24]Will you relax, I'm just kidding around. She can take a joke- \n[25]With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants. \n[26]I'll get ya for this Cheryl. \n[27]Party down! \n[28]What the hell... \n[29]Whatever it is, it's still down there. \n[30]An animal?!

We all have to. Then, once it's light out, we'll try to find a way to get around that chasm. \n[51]Everything's gonna be all right. \n[52]...Is to get some rest. Ash and I can stay up with Cheryl. \n[53]Everything's gonna be okay. Come morning- you'll see. \n[54]Shelly, are you okay? \n[55]Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute. \n[56]Shelly? \n[57]Shelly? \n[58]Ahhhhhhh! \n[59]Hit her! \n[60]Hit it! \n[61]Yeah. \n[62]Bury her. \n[63]Ash, she's dead. \n[64]Shelly's dead. We're gonna bury her now. \n[65]I saw an old hiking trail when we were driving up here. Now I don't know if it goes all the way around that gorge- \n[66]Or if it's even still in tact. But uh, I guess I'll find out. Take good care of Linda. \n[67]all set. \n[68]Don't bother, really. \n[69]If I find a way out of here, I'll mark it and then come back. Then if I'm not back here in a few hours... if for some reason...well, if I don't come back, grab Linda, leg and all, and just get her the hell out of here. \n[70]Good, I'm the best. \n[71]Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I can't feel my legs. \n[72]It's, it's not gonna let us leave... Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're all gonna die here... \n[73]...All gonna die. All of us. \n[74]Jesus Ash.

I am a pro- fessor of ancient Egyptian mythology in Dextin university's ancient history department... \n[2]entry from a small cabin in the south- ern mountains of Tennessee. Here, I am staying with my wife for a few weeks so that I may continue my research un- disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc- iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I believe I have made an important find in that area, and thus the reason for this log. With it, I can keep an ac- curate record of translations from my latest find; the first of six, the others still lost, volumes of ancient Sumarian burial practices and rites. Basically, it is a book of do's and don'ts dealing with the deceased en- titled \"Naturan Demanto\" roughly trans- lated \"Book Of The Dead.\" It is bound in human flesh, and inked with blood of the deceased... \n[3]deals with demons and demon resurrect- ion. These are of the Katardi family, meaning those forces believed to inhab- it the jungles and woods of man's do- main. The first few pages that I have translated warn that these demons are dangerous, everpresent, and exist primarily through this book. As legend has it, only the sacred high priests of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess these books, for they alone could properly control the resurrected de- mons. It is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living. For many years, it was thought that this legend- \n[4]Tantir-ah-mis-trobeen-ha-zar-ta \n[5]Tantir-man-ov-mis-hazen-sober. \n[6]Kanda! \n[7]Kanda! \n[8]Kanda! \n[9]March 12th.

I knew what it was. \n[10]Three days have passed since that thing has been down there. I was hop- ing to weaken it without food or water. Nothing worked. Finally, in desperation I dragged her out to the shed and dismembered her so that what- ever it was could not get up again. \n[11]This is when I saw the dark figures moving about in the woods. I should have never tampered with the \"Book Of The Dead.\" I now know that what- ever it is I have resurrected through this book, is coming for me. "}}
