He trained every day and hunted little birds so he could eat them and be strong. \n[7]Of course, that's what hawks eat. So, one day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. It fainted and started to fall. And when it was about to hit the ground, all the birds flew toward him and saved him. \n[8]Yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: I want to thank you for saving me, but I can't change and I'm going to keep hunting you. The little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. But we will always save you, because that's who we are. \n[9]Did you like it? \n[10]Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con la luz apagada. \n[11]No pasa nada. \n[12]A ti no te va a pasar eso... \n[13]That only happens to some babies when they're really little. \n[14]He wasn't angry, he was just very sad. \n[15]Go to sleep.
