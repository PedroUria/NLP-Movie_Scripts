Dino, cut it out -- ! \n[4]Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it -- \n[5]Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- ! \n[6]-- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino -- \n[7]-- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats? \n[8]And what's wrong with my leftovers? \n[9]That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me! \n[10]Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- \n[11]-- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here -- \n[12]Thanks, Wilma... \n[13]Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- \n[14]Yeah.   What else can go wrong? \n[15]'Bye, little sweetheart. 'Bye, big sweetheart. \n[16]What's nice about it? \n[17]This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work? \n[18]You got fired, didn't ya? \n[19]Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on. \n[20]You invented fire? \n[21]Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get? \n[22]If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano... \n[23]Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney? \n[24]Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to -- \n[25]Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice? \n[26]You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney -- \n[27]I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- \n[28]-- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. It's time to retire those dreams. \n[29]Barney.   Look. \n[30]Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls. \n[31]Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent? \n[32]Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest... \n[33]Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- -- justbeonourway -- ! \n[34]Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo -- \n[35]Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay? \n[36]My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime. \n[37]No problem. \n[38]Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint. \n[39]Not again... \n[40]All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers! \n[41]Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101. \n[42]Whoa, whoa, big fella -- \n[43]You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow! \n[44]Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- -- Barney, hold me back -- \n[45]Yeah.  That's right. I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. \n[46]Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry! \n[47]Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund -- \n[48]Barney, shut up -- Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? \n[49]Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn? \n[50]Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- -- Barney, what do I call it? \n[51]-- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'! \n[52]Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right? \n[53]Details, Barney, details... I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news... \n[54]Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change. \n[55]Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- ! \n[56]Ready when you are. Hey, '1'... a good year. \n[57]We see your dollar signs, ladies... and... \n[58]... we raise them. \n[59]You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world. \n[60]Right, pal o'mine. \n[61]wooden, then confident \n[62]-- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. \n[63]Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone. \n[64]But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. \n[65]Here you go, boys, nice and frosty... \n[66]Well, here's to... \n[67]Here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading. Anybody else got a toast...? \n[68]Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that... ... at least not till after next week's election! \n[69]Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner. \n[70]Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown. \n[71]Gentlemen, my card -- \n[72]Barney, it's all part of the plan. Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- \n[73]-- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- ' \n[74]That's right -- just like that -- \n[75]Ah, excuse us, boys... \n[76]Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be? \n[77]This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. \n[78]What do they all have in common? I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner. \n[79]That's because the silent partner is always silent. \n[80]But while you're busy being silent -- -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind. \n[81]Attaboy! \n[82]Yeah... it does feel a little light... \n[83]Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- \n[84]-- Baby, you're the greatest. \n[85]I'm already taken. \n[86]Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles? \n[87]Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned. \n[88]Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning. \n[89]Hey.   What's going on? \n[90]Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve. \n[91]Hey, you're right... ... Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it. \n[92]Welcome to the top -- partner. \n[93]I do? I mean, I do, yeah! \n[94]Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk -- \n[95]About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of 'em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- -- that! \n[96]Oh, you can, huh? \n[97]Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- \n[98]Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah. \n[99]Akkk... something... noble... man ... job... nose... wheel... shoulder... grindstone... hommm... yggggg... \n[100]Since when do you have to prepare for a landslide, right, guys? \n[101]Barn -- w-what's going on? \n[102]Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes? \n[103]Fellas, come on. We're all big boys here -- \n[104]Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play... Job, and Lodge... \n[105]Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- ! \n[106]Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. \n[107]No, no, the rest --! \n[108]Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! \n[109]No kidding. They rejected the best candidate -- \n[110]Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! We could end up with half a percent of nothing! \n[111]Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em! \n[112]I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ? \n[113]Well, I wouldn't go that far... \n[114]Oh, no, not now... \n[115]Barn! Did you see that -- ? -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn... \n[116]Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler? \n[117]Guess not... \n[118]Dare you to cross that line. \n[119]That line. \n[120]I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway... \n[121]... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam -- \n[122]Of course not, Mister Lava. But -- \n[123]Why, yeah, sure, Jerry. \n[124]Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say... \n[125]... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of -- \n[126]Well, gee, that's tough one -- -- Uh, what are my important duties? \n[127]R-rockin' Leach? \n[128]M-me?   On -- on television? \n[129]Barney who? \n[130]W-what's wrong? \n[131]Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...? \n[132]It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's just not the right image... \n[133]Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock... \n[134]No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction... \n[135]Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it... \n[136]Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that -- \n[137]You mean you can see their house -- ? \n[138]Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success... \n[139]... But deep down inside, I'm still the same lovable guy you married -- -- Frederick von Flintstone the third -- \n[140]What'd I say? \n[141]... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha... \n[142]... Hey, whoa, what's happening -- \n[143]Fred! \n[144]Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- \n[145]Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here. \n[146]You go on over to Slate City, okay? \n[147]Nah, me and some of the guys from the country club, we're gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on anyway... and I wouldn't want people to think... to think the Flintstones were party poopers. \n[148]Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend. \n[149]B... Barney? \n[150]'Pal'? How can you call me that? Barney, I... I've been such a... such a... such a... \n[151]Well, yeah.   But more of a -- \n[152]Well -- \n[153]Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk? \n[154]Aw, Barn... \n[155]Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it. \n[156]So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes? \n[157]Boy.    Talk about memories. \n[158]Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries... \n[159]What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us? \n[160]All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile -- \n[161]-- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us. \n[162]About an hour ago. \n[163]Wha... what's happening? \n[164]Your old models are just fine... \n[165]What's it? \n[166]But.. why would -- \n[167]-- Not 'somebody' -- Lava! \n[168]Then... what's happening here... \n[169]Oh no... Barney! Wilma and Betty -- and the kids -- they're all there -- \n[170]-- B-barney... what do we do? \n[171]What'll we do when we get there? \n[172]Barney -- ! -- I can't see straight -- \n[173]Ho, gweat!

That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he? \n[3]Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment -- \n[4]Fred, don't start on me again.    I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas -- \n[5]I invented fire. \n[6]I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas -- \n[7]Maybe, Fred.   But first... \n[8]Let me try some of that smoke on your car. \n[9]-- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- \n[10]-- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries... \n[11]Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. \n[12]Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock. \n[13]Did I ever? \n[14]You're a big man anywhere, Fred -- \n[15]Hey.   Lava Lane. \n[16]Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...! \n[17]Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams. \n[18]Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- ! \n[19]Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. \n[20]Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... ... Personal reference... \n[21]Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first. \n[22]It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime. \n[23]Hey, nice going, Fred.   You even got the spare -- \n[24]That's a lie, Mr. Slate! \n[25]B. Rubble. White male personal reference -- \n[26]Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- \n[27]Sure, Fred, right, right. \n[28]Fibrerock, Fred... \n[29]Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. \n[30]Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock! \n[31]No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident. \n[32]Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall. \n[33]Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him. \n[34]Plenty more where that came from. \n[35]Yeah. And nothing's ever gonna change that... right, Fred? \n[36]Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys. \n[37]My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! \n[38]-- crucible -- \n[39]Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free. \n[40]'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'! \n[41]Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards? \n[42]Fred, we gotta talk turkey -- \n[43]Fred -- ! \n[44]Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine. \n[45]The truth? \n[46]Okay. \n[47]I never knew that. \n[48]I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them. \n[49]Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you? \n[50]Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off... \n[51]Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident. \n[52]Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain. \n[53]Oh, hi, Mister Lava. \n[54]But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be -- \n[55]I guess so.   You already did. \n[56]All-right! \n[57]Ready... aim... fibre! \n[58]Fred. You gotta do something about this! \n[59]That's my Fred... \n[60]Fred? \n[61]They're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today -- \n[62]Is that a riddle? Give me a second -- \n[63]Well, there's not much to tell. True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut. \n[64]Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred? \n[65]I voted for you, Fred. \n[66]Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- ! \n[67]No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line! \n[68]No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail! \n[69]I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives. \n[70]Come on Fred.    Time to earn those big bucks. \n[71]Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.    Ready for a curve ball? \n[72]Give me your best shot. \n[73]Whattya know. Even got the spare again... \n[74]Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix. \n[75]It tastes different. \n[76]Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- \n[77]Nine days, Mister Lava. \n[78]But -- \n[79]Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian... \n[80]Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him. \n[81]Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. \n[82]You mean beside Fred? \n[83]See?   What'd I tell ya? \n[84]Hiya, Fred. Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad... ... You feeling better, pal? \n[85]Creep? \n[86]Fool? \n[87]Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? Stuck-up blimpasaurus? \n[88]Sure, Fred. I've had lots of practice. \n[89]Yeah.   Too bad we never made the team. \n[90]You know Betty. She never throws anything away. \n[91]Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? \n[92]Yeah?   When did you notice that? \n[93]Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. \n[94]I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen... \n[95]It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- \n[96]-- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it! \n[97]Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing! \n[98]Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy -- \n[99]Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- ! \n[100]... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City! \n[101]Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! \n[102]We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops! \n[103]Hang on, hang on -- \n[104]What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late! \n[105]We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- ! \n[106]Fred, stop it! It might know the way inside! \n[107]Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred? \n[108]It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- \n[109]-- Okay? \n[110]Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came! \n[111]Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam! \n[112]You think there's gonna be some? \n[113]Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... ... Fred, this... this is Dino kibble!

We're going to roll  out the first sheets of Fibrerock  by mid-week. \n[17]Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. \n[18]Of course he can, Flintstone. It's his quarry. \n[19]A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it -- \n[20]The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit.

We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? \n[24]Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down. \n[25]I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble.

Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock... \n[40]Yes? \n[41]You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties? \n[42]Publicity, Flintstone, publicity! \n[43]And that's why I've got a little surprise for you... for the man who made Fibrerock a household word, I want you to meet the man who's going to make you a household word... \n[44]Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney. \n[45]Of course, Poindexter, of course. \n[46]You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you. \n[47]Yes. I think so, too. Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive. \n[48]That's ridiculous, Flintstone! Nobody could get that many coo-coo berries off our premises! \n[49]They're convincing fakes, Mrs. Rubble -- part of our exciting display -- \n[50]Uncle! Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family? This is absurd -- \n[51]All right, all right, I admit it! I got in over my head in the stock market... took some big losses... I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day, I guess I just lost my head...

It's strong -- -- Light -- -- Resilient -- \n[12]Where on earth did you get it? \n[13]The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... \n[14]Light  as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a  child could handle this...

'Fib-bre-rock' -- \n[17]I love it! \n[18]You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies. \n[19]Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. \n[20]The Stone Age is over!    Let the Fibre Age begin! \n[21]Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone! \n[22]No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it. That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend. \n[23]Flintstone! \n[24]We do, eh?   About what? \n[25]Of course I can, Fred. I can lay them off like -- -- that, or like -- -- that, or like -- \n[26]-- that. \n[27]That's right. Why -- I could lock the front door and go fishing if I wanted! \n[28]Why, I could even fire Lava here if I wanted. \n[29]Or... I could fire you, Fred. \n[30]Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start. I'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say... this isn't a good start. I'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling about... you. You want that feeling to go away, don't you? \n[31]Good. Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this. \n[32]'Sky's the limit'...
