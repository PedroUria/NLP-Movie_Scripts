{"dialogues": {"CARSON": "\n[1]Son of a bitch! \n[2]Yeah, right. \n[3]Shit! \n[4]Asshole was trying to boost my car! \n[5]Mike -- call 911! \n[6]I hate this fuckin' town. \n[7]If I hear one more Beach Boys song, I'll shoot myself. \n[8]I said, if we were having sex once in a while, you wouldn't need to ride that fucking bike every morning. \n[9]Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed. \n[10]You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause. \n[11]You mean it's not for you. \n[12]I'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place. Even for what it's worth now. \n[13]That sure cheers me right up. \n[14]One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep. \n[15]Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people... \n[16]They're not gonna transfer me. You know damn well why I was bumped down to guard duty... My outstanding people skills. \n[17]I hate this fuckin' town. \n[18]Give me a secure radio! \n[19]You bet -- nice and easy. \n[20]Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on its way. \n[21]Check it out! Ahead, on the right! \n[22]Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll move up; he won't suspect a civilian car. Stay back, then get on his ass when I signal. We'll box him in. \n[23]If the Mod Squad gets in your way, don't be shy about getting 'em out. \n[24]He's gonna wrap it around something! \n[25]Oh, shit... \n[26]I'm in no mood... \n[27]Let's get back to the Consulate. \n[28]His Security Chief. There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents. \n[29]I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him... \n[30]Start a trace! \n[31]Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl Streep. \n[32]Say you want to talk to the kids... \n[33]Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number. \n[34]Oh, Jesus, those're explosives! Look at the TV -- this was just taken. \n[35]-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need! This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining? \n[36]...You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family?! \n[37]-- They know their phones are tapped! They tap our fucking phones! \n[38]This Consulate is my responsibility. \n[39]...Our worst enemy'll be the city. There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. Add the Friday rush hour and usual L.A. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 PM. It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts... You don't agree? \n[40]You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter? \n[41]-- Already doing it. We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the NSA and the CIA. \n[42]If she'd changed her name when we got married, I wouldn't have to. \n[43]My ass. \n[44]-- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job? \n[45]I'll coordinate the drop. \n[46]It sucks. \n[47]-- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector... Meaning he'll find this one. This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect. And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector. \n[48]Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation. \n[49]Just tell me if we can use it. \n[50]Nothing but physical surveillance. \n[51]Well, it ain't gonna happen. Not again... \n[52]Shit... no way we can set up a stake- out in... \n[53]Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers at the Bowl. Have them clear the area of civilians. \n[54]Must've bought a house same time we did. \n[55]There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out. \n[56]Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck. Which way's he heading? \n[57]We're made! Gotta grab him! \n[58]Watch it! We need him alive! \n[59]FBI. Call our office, they'll take care of you. \n[60]Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit... \n[61]Helicopter or two would be nice! \n[62]Not just now, dear... \n[63]I coulda had a ranch... maybe some horses... but no, we moved to L.A. \n[64]He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower! \n[65]Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo! \n[66]Fingerprint it. He's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages... \n[67]Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to figure it out for ourselves. \n[68]Miranda! We need a copter, pronto! Get back to his van. There were no plates, but check the VIN, look it over, then meet us at the Consulate. \n[69]Go! \n[70]...Scrounge us some bodies: National Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local PD's, meter maids -- \n[71]Look, I don't need you to tell me how fucked we are! \n[72]Let's take stock. We've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls -- \n[73]Same with his fingerprints. But that means we need high-quality image and data transmission. We can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in Westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment. \n[74]-- You want to play games, fine. \n[75]South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen? \n[76]Shitcan that thing, will you?! \n[77]Got a digital scanner? \n[78]You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade. Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls. \n[79]This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes. \n[80]Dazzle me. \n[81]We got one of the best sound guys right here in town... Newman in Audio Analysis... \n[82]Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada. \n[83]No... 'cause you're fat. \n[84]Jesus H. Christ... \n[85]Do it. \n[86]Any significance? \n[87]Get the Bureau on it. \n[88]Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now. \n[89]He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30. \n[90]He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive... ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them. \n[91]-- Bet he doubled back. \n[92]Cute. He signed the name of the Allied Commander during the Korean War. Maybe he was a political. \n[93]Who's got those kinds of skills: Electronics, vehicle customizing, computers, explosives? \n[94]I'm going to the kidnapping site. \n[95]Great, we'll hire a bus. \n[96]Jump a copter to the Consulate. See if the manufacturer sells to the public. Find out what shops use their stuff; put people on the phones with a description of the perp. \n[97]Twelve-gauge shell filled with magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's worse than napalm -- Geneva Convention outlawed it for warfare. \n[98]Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order. Where's the Consulate's car? \n[99]Shut up! \n[100]Find it! How many bulletproof Mercedes could be cruising around Crenshaw? \n[101]I hate this fuckin' town. \n[102]Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was working alone, and he was a vicious son of a bitch. Old news. \n[103]We going steady? \n[104]Looks like the wheel of a car. \n[105]I thought that about all of them. C'mon, think, dammit!! \n[106]Call the outdoor advertising companies. Get the location of all the billboards for Japanese cars within our search parameters. \n[107]Say what? \n[108]Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole thing. And we're knocking our heads, trying to find your people, just for show. \n[109]Let's grab a few beers, kick back 'til five o'clock rolls by. Then maybe we can have a war over it. I think that's a great idea, seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now! \n[110]Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep around the office... \"Dr. Knoll-It- All.\" \n[111]Miranda... Shit. \n[112]Everyone shut up! Guy on vacation, the Canadian -- \n[113]Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes? \n[114]I need a full name, address, anything you got! \n[115]That's appropriate... In 30 seconds you're gonna give me Paul Javal's shoe size. \n[116]Carson... \n[117]Whatta you got? \n[118]How high up are they? \n[119]Okay -- high-rises in our search area. Eight stories or higher. \n[120]Sabatini! What about that billboard? \n[121]LAPD will have a record of all emergency vehicles running Code 3 at 9:32 AM. Get their starting point and their destination. \n[122]Where's that fuckin' address?! \n[123]Get his Driver's License number; Social; bank accounts; charge cards; club memberships... find out what movies he rented.  Get whoever's closest to the Auto Shop to get in there, interview everybody. \n[124]Hey, he watched the news... Everyone knows the U.S. will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country. \n[125]-- Quit apologizing for me! \n[126]Sounds like her aim's a little low. \n[127]Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise! Sabatini -- you're with us. She's got the field experience. \n[128]There's a TV station a couple blocks away. We'll land on their pad. K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to hang back unless we need 'em. \n[129]Oh, great, the media... It's the goddamn traffic girl! \n[130]We can't get into that right now... \n[131]This works out, I'll play the fuckin' banjo for you. \n[132]We're hoofing it. \n[133]Whoa... FBI..! \n[134]How the hell you get here so fast? \n[135]Terrific. Who else is here? \n[136]Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up. Give me your master key. \n[137]Wait here. \n[138]I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around. \n[139]\n[140]I said keep everyone back!! \n[141]Get out of my sight. \n[142]What's the status? \n[143]Hurry it the hell up. \n[144]I should've known she'd come up. \n[145]-- \"Should've.\" Shit, there's a familiar word. That day... I was there soon enough. We should've rushed 'em, before they could finish setting up... \n[146]Twelve bodies -- only the hostages. \n[147]-- Those kids were ten years old! Same age as the Han boy... \n[148]C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes! \n[149]Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours. \n[150]Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning... \n[151]Get down! \n[152]\n[153]Get the fuck out of here! \n[154]Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here! \n[155]Miranda..! \n[156]I want you to get out of here... \n[157]...The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em? \n[158]Negative -- his car's armored! And we need the bastard alive!! \n[159]One of yours? What the hell do you need heat- seeking rockets for in L.A.? \n[160]And they call me Mr. Overkill. Dave, what do you know about... \n[161]Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets? \n[162]-- Skip the goddamn trivia! I need range, guidance, arming method, anything we can work with... \n[163]That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about? \n[164]No shit... \n[165]This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be. \n[166]Get me out of here... \n[167]Anybody see him? \n[168]Dave... You're sure those rockets are heat-seeking? \n[169]Just keep working your leads... \n[170]This is Carson. I need a copter. \n[171]Something small and nimble. Anybody... come in low, from the south... I'm on an ambulance by the 9th Street exit. \n[172]I'll make him open the sunroof. Someone can shoot tear gas or a percussion grenade inside. \n[173]No way. I couldn't stand making so many people happy. \n[174]You?! I wanted a police copter! \n[175]Wrong-o... \n[176]Got 'im -- looks like he's headed for the 101. \n[177]Pull hard to the left, on my signal... \n[178]Now! \n[179]Well, what the hell were you doing out there? \n[180]Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on! \n[181]I'll just use my outstanding people skills. \n[182]That car's like a rock, right? \n[183]Dave... \n[184]Anything else come through? \n[185]Not yet... \n[186]You're shittin'... Where?! \n[187]...Have the Manager evacuate the complex. Find out which unit the family's in, but don't let anyone go in 'til we get there. \n[188]\"Fuck-you\" pumps?? \n[189]Apartment number would be real helpful, gang... \n[190]Okay... work with me here! \n[191]\n[192]We have to go out the window. \n[193]Too risky. Let's concentrate on getting you out of here. \n[194]Sound detectors? \n[195]Pressure sensors. Use 'em in convertibles: Bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off. These are rigged backwards -- get up, you set 'em off. \n[196]Nope. But I've had some car alarms in my day. For all the goddamn good they do... \n[197]Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow... \n[198]It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... Okay... pick it up. \n[199]Low-tech solution... Lean back... Carefully. \n[200]Nag, nag, nag... \n[201]You'll be over in five seconds... \n[202]\n[203]Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line. \n[204]Release the cable from your side! Get out of here! \n[205]\n[206]...I'll call you next week. \n[207]The Bureau. They want me back on the hostage team. \n[208]Told 'em I'd sleep on it... \n[209]It's my outstanding people skills. ", "MIRANDA": "\n[1]Pete... please... we have to be up early tomorrow. Call the police. \n[2]\n[3]Not again... \n[4]I was watching that. \n[5]Be right with you... \n[6]Have you gotten any sleep lately? \n[7]Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane. \n[8]It's not for you. \n[9]I don't chase car thieves in my underwear. C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved. \n[10]Lots of people bought at the top of the market... \n[11]I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: \"Wherever you go, there you are.\" \n[12]I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it? \n[13]Ask for a transfer. \n[14]I'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money. \n[15]I still want to check the MO against known politicals, terrorists -- \n[16]Have someone talk to the LAPD, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega. \n[17]I'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together... \n[18]Everything indicates he's working alone. And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so I agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom. \n[19]But it means we can get on with it. \n[20]Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther. If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened. \n[21]He'll expect a homing device -- \n[22]Why must you always refer generically to criminals as \"assholes?\" \n[23]You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again? \n[24]He's really exhibiting pressured speech... big effort here to sound calm. Same with his vocabulary... if he were in control, he wouldn't feel such a need to sound that way. \n[25]If we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening, but I'm not going to risk it. This is the worst kind of perpetrator: anything makes him deviate from his carefully- scripted plan, he could become extremely volatile. \n[26]Do we have back-up if the bleeper fails? \n[27]It's real important we don't lose him. He didn't go through all the trouble of designing that bomb not to use it. \n[28]Yes, please go ahead... \n[29]-- I'm only here to see that everyone gets what they want -- \n[30]The drop is at the DeMille barn, across from the Hollywood Bowl. You're to leave the money in the center of the parking lot. \n[31]Remember, Pete... we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage. \n[32]What happened? \n[33]All right... Carefully... \n[34]Love to be in the loop on this... \n[35]Stop! The clock's running! Arguing is a luxury we can't afford! \n[36]What's done is done. There'll be plenty of time to point fingers later. \n[37]Well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator... \n[38]-- That's right! We can send them to our experts for analysis... \n[39]Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows. \n[40]Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD -- \n[41]Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines. \n[42]It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in. We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is. \n[43]Forget it. It's a waste of manpower. \n[44]That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb. \n[45]The most densely-populated part of the L.A. basin. This narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings. \n[46]He was traveling west -- \n[47]C'mon, that's total conjecture -- \n[48]You're telling me? \n[49]No. The phony ice cream truck, the booby-trapped chairs... he could've \n[50]done it without half that stuff. But this was going to be the score of a lifetime... he was showing off. \n[51]I want to talk to the witnesses. \n[52]Then how did he get it? \n[53]He means all of us \"you people.\" \n[54]We talked about these billboards, when we were car shopping! Four- door... they make a wagon, too. Something Japanese... God, what was it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You thought it had no character. \n[55]You think!! You were there, too! \n[56]Pete! Christ, you're self-indulgent! There's nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you, so they're all you can express any more. No wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks you're such a nutcase! \n[57]You've been dying to tell me that... \n[58]Downtown, Century City, Westwood corridor, Museum Row, Mid- Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip there's a few... \n[59]And have them narrow their foot- searches to areas around high-rises. \n[60]This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer. \n[61]Ambassador -- \n[62]Quit giving me reasons to! \n[63]There still could be accomplices. If there are, they'll hear us in the helicopter. \n[64]Traffic person. \n[65]Sorry... \n[66]Guess what, Sister... you're about to spend the next five years in a penitentiary for interfering with a federal investigation. \n[67]Sorry... \n[68]I like what you've done with the place... \n[69]Stop it! \n[70]Pete -- \n[71]The Bureau never would've let you. They want it by the book: talk them out. \n[72]You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your decision. You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping -- \n[73]Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry! Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies? \n[74]Go..! \n[75]I heard. I'm in the copter. \n[76]Shut up and keep your eyes on the road. That's my goddamn car. Dave? You staying on top of the research? \n[77]Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay? \n[78]-- You don't \"work with\" rockets, Peter! \n[79]Stay back. LAPD's putting up a roadblock. \n[80]Still heading north on the 110. \n[81]Are you out of your mind? \n[82]Switch to a secure channel. What on earth are you thinking? \n[83]Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or anything on me, have you? \n[84]You fucking lunatic!! \n[85]Sorry... \n[86]You're completely deranged! Playing chicken with rockets! \n[87]Even if we can pry him out with... Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll be very cooperative. \n[88]Ever hear of \"fuck-me\" pumps? Well, these are fuck you pumps! Where's the family? \n[89]There! \n[90]How's it going in there? \n[91]Come over the railing! Grab onto the harness! \n[92]Tear the hook loose! \n[93]Try it anyway! \n[94]Who was that on the phone? \n[95]What did you say? \n[96]Working with you today was certainly... interesting, Inspector. \n[97]I hate this fucking town... ", "DAVE": "\n[1]I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em a chance to hose out my cage. \n[2]Who's the fuckin' gargoyle? \n[3]Not if you made it. Why don't you get Sabatini to brew the java?

He found the bleepers -- both of them! \n[14]Toward the freeway. \n[15]On my way... \n[16]Newman's gone. \n[17]He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming. \n[18]Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like to see the fight tonight. \n[19]Enchilada -- you saying that because I'm Mexican? \n[20]-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle PD a month ago. \n[21]Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your average high-school student if they're so inclined. My guess is our perp used off-the-shelf equipment for everything except the C-4, and that's only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin, if you know who to ask. \n[22]...I know it's privileged information, goddammit! Lemme talk to a supervisor... You are a supervisor... Lemme talk to your goddamn supervisor... I told you, I'm with the FBI... Cellular company says he was using a phone with a cloned number. \n[23]That's what I'm trying to get. They're saying I need a subpoena. Don't put me on hold... Don't... I'm listening to Michael fuckin' Bolton! \n[24]...Peerless Auto Security.

One of Javal's alias accounts: check for an apartment rental! \n[41]Park La Brea! \n[42]Private security's going around with PA's, and they set off the fire alarm. Well, try callin' him again!
