Have you lost something again? \n[5]To return this book to Pere Robert. It's about two lovers in fair Verona. \n[6]There must be more than this provincial life \n[7]Two cities in Northern Italy.    I didn't want to come back. \n[8]Have you got any new places to go? \n[9]Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big. \n[10]Oh... isn't this amazing? It's my favorite part because you'll see Here's where she meets Prince Charming But she won't discover that it's him `Til chapter three \n[11]You've read it? \n[12]Sorry, not tonight. \n[13]No. \n[14]Papa, do you think I'm odd? \n[15]I don't know. People talk. \n[16]Just tell me one more thing about her. \n[17]A rose like the one in the painting. \n[18]And every year, you bring it. \n[19]I'll see you tomorrow! \n[20]Stay safe... \n[21]The laundry. \n[22]Come! \n[23]...over the dark wood. \n[24]All I wanted was to teach a child to read. \n[25]I'm not ready to have children. \n[26]It's a small village, Gaston.     I've met them all. \n[27]Gaston, we could never make each other happy. No one can change that much. \n[28]I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston. \n[29]Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless... \n[30]Madame Gaston, can't you just see it Madame Gaston, his little wife No sir, not me, I guarantee it \n[31]I want much more than this Provincial life... \n[32]I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned \n[33]Philippe? \n[34]What happened? Where is Papa?! \n[35]Take me to him! \n[36]Who said that? Who's there? \n[37]Papa!?   Is that you? \n[38]Oh, your hands are ice.   We need to get you home. \n[39]Who?! \n[40]Who's there? Who are you? \n[41]I've come for my father. \n[42]Liar! \n[43]I asked for the rose.   Punish me, not him! \n[44]A life sentence for a rose? \n[45]Come into the light. \n[46]Alright, Papa. I will leave. I need a minute alone with him. \n[47]Are you so cold-hearted that you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye? Forever can spare a minute! \n[48]I should have been with you. \n[49]Forget you? Everything I am is because of you. \n[50]I love you too, Papa... \n[51]I'm not afraid. And I will escape, I promise. \n[52]He is my father. \n[53]Don't hurt him! \n[54]My room?   But I thought -- \n[55]\n[56]What are you? \n[57]And you can talk. \n[58]Why would I be startled?   I'm talking to a candle. \n[59]Why, what's in the west wing? \n[60]It's... beautiful. \n[61]Is everything here alive? Hello, what's your name? \n[62]But I'm not a princess. \n[63]Just a minute. \n[64]You've taken me prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane? \n[65]And I told you no! \n[66]I'd starve before I ever ate with you! \n[67]I told you to go away. \n[68]I'm so worried about him.      He's never been on his own. \n[69]But he said, \"If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all.\" \n[70]Surely you're as trapped here as I am. Don't you ever want to escape? \n[71]Lumiere mentioned something about the West Wing... \n[72]Good night. \n[73]Nothing. \n[74]Getting out of here! \n[75]You have to help me... you have to stand... \n[76]If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much. \n[77]Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away. \n[78]Well you should learn to control your temper. \n[79]Try to get some rest. \n[80]Why do you care so much about him? \n[81]But he has cursed you somehow. Why? You did nothing. \n[82]How in the midst of all this sorrow Can so much hope and love endure? I was innocent and certain Now I'm wiser but unsure \n[83]What happens when the last petal falls? \n[84]I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse. \n[85]Love can transpose to form and dignity. Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. And therefore -- \n[86]So you know Shakespeare? \n[87]Actually, \"Romeo and Juliet\" is my favorite play. \n[88]Sorry? \n[89]Like what? \n[90]It's wonderful. \n[91]Have you really read every one of these books? \n[92]Was that a joke?   Are you making jokes now? \n[93]The air is blue and keen and cold And in a frozen sheath enrolled \n[94]Each branch, each twig, each blade of grass Seems clad miraculously with glass \n[95]But in that solemn silence Is heard the whisper Of every sleeping thing: \"Look, look at me Come wake me up For still here I be.\" \n[96]There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined \n[97]And now he's dear and so unsure I wonder why I didn't see it there before \n[98]New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be? \n[99]True that he's no Prince Charming But there's something in him that I simply didn't see! \n[100]What are you reading? \n[101]Guinevere and Lancelot. \n[102]But still... it's a romance. \n[103]I never thanked you for saving my life. \n[104]They know how to have a good time. \n[105]Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a \"funny girl,\" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment. \n[106]Almost as lonely as your castle. \n[107]How amazing. \n[108]Paris. \n[109]It's so much smaller than I imagined. \n[110]This is the Paris of my childhood These were the borders of my life In this crumbling dusty attic Where an artist loved his wife I thought that I would find an answer Here where his heart has always lived \n[111]Now I see it's empty and abandoned Easy to remember Harder to move on Knowing that the Paris of my childhood Is gone \n[112]That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask... \n[113]Let's go home. \n[114]I don't know... \n[115]Could anyone be happy if they're not free? \n[116]My father taught me to dance.   I used to step on his toes a lot. \n[117]Very much. \n[118]I'd like to see my father. \n[119]Papa!   What are they doing to him?! \n[120]What did you say? \n[121]Thank you. \n[122]\n[123]Open this door! He's hurt! \n[124]My father's not crazy!   Gaston... Tell him! \n[125]I have just come from the castle and there is a beast! \n[126]You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST! \n[127]There is your proof! \n[128]No, don't be afraid.    He is gentle and kind. \n[129]He's not a monster, Gaston. You are. The beast would never hurt anyone. \n[130]This isn't over Gaston, you'll see! \n[131]I have to warn the beast -- \n[132]He let me go, papa.     He sent me back to you. \n[133]He took me there. I know what happened to maman. \n[134]I understand. \n[135]Will you help me now? \n[136]Yes.   Yes it is. \n[137]Where is he?! \n[138]\n[139]\n[140]I tried to stop them! \n[141]Stop!     Gaston, no! \n[142]No!   It's too far! \n[143]Of course I came back.   I'll never leave you again. \n[144]We're together now.   It's going to be fine. You'll see. \n[145]No... please, no... \n[146]Please, don't leave me.    Come back. \n[147]I love you. \n[148]How would you feel about growing a beard? ", "LUMI\u00c8RE": "\n[1]Must have lost his way in the woods... \n[2]A man of taste. \n[3]Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl. \n[4]But what if she is the one?   The one who will break the spell? \n[5]Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle, but I have been sent to escort you to your room. \n[6]What? That once this door closes it will not open again, RARRR? I know, he gets so dramatic. \n[7]`Allo. \n[8]Oh, you are very strong.    That's a great quality! \n[9]I am Lumi\u00e8re. \n[10]What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth: a man or a mantle clock? \n[11]Ready, miss? Trust me. \n[12]You must forgive first impressions, I hope you are not too startled. \n[13]Candelabra, please. Enormous difference. But consider me at your service. The castle is your home now, so feel free to go anywhere you like -- \n[14]Uh... nothing. Storage space.   That's it. \n[15]This way, please! \n[16]Or as I like to call it, the only wing! Watch your step s'il vous plait. \n[17]Welcome to your new home. It's modest, but comfortable... \n[18]Of course. Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle. \n[19]Oh dear!   We were not expecting guests. \n[20]I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette. \n[21]How can I be strong when you make me so weak? \n[22]Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer. \n[23]Ah, stay with us, Madame!    We have someone for you to dress! \n[24]Mm.   Subtle. Understated.    I love it! \n[25]Be calm, let me do the talking. \n[26]We thought you might appreciate the company. \n[27]That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her. Good thinking, Cogsworth! \n[28]You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human. \n[29]Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death. \n[30]You see, there she is.    Now, master, remember. Be gentle. \n[31]And when she opens the door, give her a dashing debonair smile. Come come -- show me the smile. \n[32]Oh mon dieu. \n[33]Oh master, you've returned! \n[34]Eh, I got you there! \n[35]Another petal fell... \n[36]I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day. \n[37]They're coming! Final checks, everyone, tout de suite! \n[38]Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room. Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot! \n[39]A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times. \n[40]Stand up straight! It's time to sparkle! \n[41]I have no taste buds, but I can tell this is exquisite. \n[42]Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music? \n[43]Maestro Cadenza, are you ready? \n[44]Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse. \n[45]Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax. \n[46]Let us pull up a chair... as the dining room proudly presents... \n[47]... your dinner. Be our guest, be our guest \n[48]Put our service to the test Tie your napkin `round your neck, cherie And we provide the rest! \n[49]Soup du jour, hot hors d'oeuvres Why we only live to serve Try the grey stuff, it's delicious \n[50]Don't believe me? Ask the dishes! \n[51]They can sing, they can dance After all, miss, this is France! \n[52]And a dinner here is never second best Go on unfold your menu Take a glance and then you'll Be our guest, be our guest \n[53]Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flamb\u00e9! \n[54]We'll prepare and serve with flair A culinary cabaret! \n[55]You're alone and you're scared But the banquet's all prepared! \n[56]No one's gloomy or complaining While the flatware's entertaining! \n[57]We tell jokes, I do tricks With my fellow candlesticks \n[58]Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest. \n[59]Oui our guest Be our guest, be our guest! \n[60]Life is so unnerving For a servant who's not serving \n[61]He's not whole Without a soul to wait upon \n[62]Ah, those good old days when we were useful Suddenly, those good old days are gone \n[63]Too long we've been rusting Needing so much more than dusting Needing exercise A chance to use our skills \n[64]Most days we just lay around the castle Flabby, fat and lazy \n[65]You walked in, and oops-a-daisie! \n[66]She's our guest! \n[67]Pudding?! \n[68]Checkmate.     Again. \n[69]Mademoiselle... what are you doing? \n[70]Go go, Froufrou! \n[71]Please, don't go! It's dangerous! \n[72]We are eternally grateful. \n[73]Let him sleep. \n[74]The master remains a beast forever.     And the rest of us become... \n[75]Knickknacks. \n[76]Well, who indeed? \n[77]And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own? \n[78]No, Master, it's perfect! The rose has only four petals left. Which means tonight... you must tell her how you feel. \n[79]Do not be discouraged. \n[80]She is the one. \n[81]You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight... \n[82]Don't worry, master, you'll do fine. \n[83]In the dark. \n[84]Dark and very very dusty. \n[85]Start with the hair! Women love nice hair. \n[86]Dip dip, snip snip... \n[87]And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance... \n[88]OK, I can fix this! \n[89]Master... how could you do that? \n[90]Then why are we not human? \n[91]At least he has finally learned to love. \n[92]Could it be? \n[93]Sacrebleu!     Invaders. \n[94]I know what to do. \n[95]Watch your toes! \n[96]Bon voyage! Safe trip home! \n[97]We did it, Plumette.   Victory is ours. \n[98]Plumette...? Oh! My dear Plumette... \n[99]It's all right, Cogsworth. \n[100]The honor was mine. \n[101]Cogsworth, we beat the clock! \n[102]Plumette... mon amour... \n[103]Oh, my Prince! \n[104]It's so good to see you!

Now... do you still wish to take your father's place? \n[5]\n[6]When this door closes, it will not open again. \n[7]You took his place. \n[8]He's a fool. So are you. \n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! \"Charm the prisoner.\" \n[13]She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her? \n[14]You will join me for dinner!     That's not a request. \n[15]Will you join me for dinner? \n[16]I told you to come down to dinner. \n[17]Well be my guest! Go ahead and starve!

Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours. \n[31]Not all of them. Some are in Greek. \n[32]Maybe. \n[33]She glanced this way I thought I saw And when we touched She didn't shudder at my paw No, it can't be I'll just ignore But then she's never looked at me that way before \n[34]Nothing. \n[35]Well actually, King Arthur and the Round Table. Knights, and men, and swords and things... \n[36]All right.     I felt like a change. \n[37]Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves. \n[38]Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies. \n[39]I'm sorry.     Your village sounds terrible. \n[40]What do you say we run away? \n[41]Another little \"gift\" from the Enchantress... \n[42]A book that truly allows you to escape. \n[43]It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you. \n[44]Think of the place you've most wanted to see. First, see it in your mind's eye.

Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best. \n[2]I know. Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful. \n[3]Yes, but ever since the war I've been missing something. And she's the only girl I've met who gives me that sense of... \n[4]I don't know what that means. \n[5]Right from the moment when I met her, saw her I said she's gorgeous and I fell Here in town there's only she Who is beautiful as me So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle \n[6]Good morning, Belle!   Wonderful book you have there. \n[7]Well, not that one. But, you know. Books. For your dinner table. Shall I join you this evening? \n[8]Busy? \n[9]No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey. \n[10]That's what makes Belle so appealing. She hasn't made a fool of herself just to gain my favor. What would you call that? \n[11]It's outrageously attractive, isn't it? \n[12]You are the wildest, most beautiful thing I've ever seen. No one deserves you, but at least I know our children will be beautiful. \n[13]What is it, LeFou? \n[14]Oh well. It's hero time. I'm not done with you yet. \n[15]Belle! Heard you had a little trouble with the headmaster. He never liked me, either. Can I give you a little advice about the villagers, though? They're never going to trust the kind of change we're trying to bring. \n[16]The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own. \n[17]Maybe you haven't met the right man. \n[18]Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed. \n[19]Belle, do you know what happens to spinsters in our village after their fathers die? \n[20]They beg for scraps, like poor Agathe. This is our world, Belle. For simple folk like us, it doesn't get any better. \n[21]Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? \"I will never marry you, Gaston.\" \n[22]A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits. \n[23]As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating \n[24]I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou \n[25]Yep. \n[26]When I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver And beasts of the field say a prayer First I carefully aim for the liver Then I shoot from behind! \n[27]I don't care \n[28]\n[29]When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs Ev'ry morning to help me get large \n[30]And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs So I'm roughly the size of a barge! \n[31]Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston? \n[32]I use antlers in all of my decorating! \n[33]Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet? \n[34]I'll help you, Maurice! \n[35]Everyone! Stop making fun of this man at once! \n[36]Don't thank me, Maurice.    Lead us to the beast. \n[37]Look, enough is enough.   We have to turn back. \n[38]I'm done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle? \n[39]There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation. \n[40]So why don't we just turn around go back to Villeneuve? I'm sure Belle is at home, cooking up a lovely dinner... \n[41]Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let's go home. \n[42]\n[43]Widows... \n[44]Please, forgive me, old bean. That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it? \n[45]If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me. \n[46]Are you coming? \n[47]Oh, Maurice! Thank heavens. I've spent the last five days trying to find you. \n[48]Maurice, it's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder. \n[49]Agathe? You'd hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag? No offense, Agathe. \n[50]You're right. Don't take my word for it. \n[51]LeFou, my dearest companion, did I, your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot, try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved? \n[52]Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind. \n[53]Everything's going to be fine. \n[54]Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free. \n[55]Take him away! \n[56]Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims. \n[57]We all admire your devotion to your father, but you'd say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof. \n[58]This is sorcery! \n[59]Look at this beast. Look at his fangs, his claws. \n[60]The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him. \n[61]I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence! \n[62]We can't have her running off to warn the beast. Lock her up too. \n[63]DO YOU WANT TO BE NEXT?
