{"dialogues": {"OXFORD": "\n[1]Well, it's certainly... big. \n[2]Bricklayers and whores watching Aristophones?   You're quite right, Henry, not only have I never witnessed it, I'm not sure I care to. \n[3]There won't be puppets, will there? \n[4]An ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s. Deus ex machina. Machine of the Gods. \n[5]Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes into a situation from which they couldn't write their way out-- \n[6]--Out came the ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s... As when Hippolytus is saved by Artemis, or Medea flown to Athens... Always good for an ap\u00f2 mekhanes the\u00f3s was Euripides \n[7]\n[8]Out! \n[9]Henry, how many people were at that play? \n[10]And how many performances are there of a play like that? \n[11]So! Ten thousand souls. All listening to the writings of one man-- the ideas of one man. That's power, Robert. And if there is one thing the Cecils understand, it's power. \n[12]Essex played rather poorly, didn't he? \n[13]Henry... The Cecils brook no rivals. \n[14]I would have you deny him. \n[15]That is rumor only, Henry-- \n[16]I desire nothing more than to see the next king be the rightful king. But what Essex contemplates will surely lead to Civil War. No. If this is to be done, it must be done carefully, skillfully. \n[17]I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost. \n[18]Henry! Will you do me one thing more? Deliver a gift for me? A rather... elaborate gift? \n[19]\n[20]The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think? \n[21]So it does.   So it does. \n[22]That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly. \n[23]Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter. \n[24]It did, however, serve as helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name. \n[25]Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it wasn't. But you are free, are you not? \n[26]I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential. \n[27]But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious. \n[28]That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants. All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson? \n[29]Francesco. \n[30]One you shall stage Bankside. \n[31]Under your name. \n[32]I can't very well use my name, can I? I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. The Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales, Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc. No. I have a... reputation to protect. In my world, one does not write plays, Jonson. People like you do. \n[33]Not a play, Jonson, I've written many. No doubt, many more than you yourself. A good number performed at Court years ago, others never seen by a living soul. \n[34]No. I mean you to put your name to all of them. \n[35]Well don't look like I just gutted your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make you the most popular-- and therefore the most monetarily successful-- playwright in all of London. \n[36]I wish you god speed and good morrow. \n[37]\n[38]Henry-- \n[39]I can't give it to you. \n[40]Henry-- Henry!! \n[41]An actor?!! \n[42]An actor for god's sake? \n[43]You presumed to think? On my behalf? Whatever made you believe you had that prerogative? \n[44]Voice? You have no voice! That's why I chose you! You at least kept my name from him? \n[45]And will continue to do so? \n[46]A romantic tragedy. In iambic pentameter. \n[47]Of course it is! \n[48]Dowry? \n[49]I can give her Brooke House and a hundred pounds. \n[50]That is all we have to give at the moment. \n[51]Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned. \n[52]Anne-- If you could have seen them-- the mob... They, they didn't just sit there like the reptilia of court, faces motionless, fangs momentarily retracted. No! They, they jumped on stage, they fought the French! A butcher-- he actually broke his arm! He was so-- \n[53]The voices, Anne... The voices. I, I can't stop them... They, they come when I sleep, when I wake, when I sup, when I, I, I walk down a hall! The sweet longings of a maiden, the, the surging ambitions of a courtier, the foul designs of a murderer, the wretched pleas of his victims.    Only- - only when I put their words-- their voices-- to parchment are they cast loose, freed... Only then is my mind... quieted... at peace. \n[54]I... would go mad if I didn't write down the voices. \n[55]I... don't know. \n[56]Did he? \n[57]Bien. Faisons du travail... le Coup droit d'autorit\u00e9? \n[58]Bien.    En garde! \n[59]Qu'est ce que vous faites? \n[60]Beaulieu?    Beaulieu?! \n[61]Beaulieu-- he, he tried to kill me... \n[62]So! You are the famous Shakespeare whose labors I have enjoyed so much. I am at your service, sir. \n[63]I beg your pardon? \n[64]\"Aggrandized\"? \n[65]Wait! How much? \n[66]Pay him. \n[67]Pagalo! \n[68]Wisdom, Francesco, is a quality I have unfortunately never possessed... \n[69]watches stoically, his wife and children at his side. \n[70]I am Edward, Earl of Oxford. \n[71]Nothing. \n[72]Fight him in London, and you only validate every rumor and lie Cecil has ever told about you. \n[73]No. I will go to Elizabeth, myself, alone-- \n[74]I won't send her a letter.   I will send her a book. \n[75]She will call for me. And while I am with her, you will come-- not with an army, not with swords, but with her loyal subjects. The cobblers, the tinkers, the bricklayers of London. \n[76]All, all calling for Robert Cecil's banishment from Court. Words, Robert, words, will prevail with her, not swords. \n[77]Leave that to me. \n[78]You shall begin rehearsals immediately. But it is not to be performed until I tell you. And you may only have a day's notice. \n[79]Oh, and congratulations. You've had an epic poem published today. \n[80]He wanted his grandson to be an Earl. \n[81]You lie... \n[82]Elizabeth would never have-- \n[83]I thank your majesty for seeing me. \n[84]He is our son. \n[85]They only wished for a place in government equal to their station. Equal to their birth. \n[86]Then take my head. In our son's stead. \n[87]Neither they nor I ever conspired against you. Cecil alone was our aim. He has corrupted your-- \n[88]We would have protected you-- \n[89]Let our child live... \n[90]He will never learn of it from me. \n[91]But only after my death! Only then! When all is complete. After James is crowned king, his crown safe, only then can you claim your son... our son. This Island will be whole. \n[92]One Island, one kingdom, one King. Scotsman though he be. That, that will be my final gift to my people. And I shall remain pure... Un-taken! \n[93]Thank you, doctor. \n[94]Come over here, Jonson... \n[95]Did you know, Jonson, that my family can trace its peerage farther back than any family in the kingdom?   We fought at Crecy. At Bosworth Field. At Agincourt. I inherited my Earldom as one of the wealthiest men ever to breathe English air... and at last breath, I shall be one of the poorest. \n[96]Never a voice in government. Never a sword raised in glorious battle. No immortal deeds for my heirs to know me by. Words, merely words, are to be my legacy... You alone watch my plays and know them as mine. When I hear the applause, the cheering, of the audience, all those hands clapping, they are celebrating... another man. But in that cacophony of sounds, I strained to hear the sound of two hands only. Yours. But heard them, I never did. \n[97]Death takes away all pretense and demands honesty from its target. You, you have never told me... never told me what you thought of my work... \n[98]Promise me... promise me, Jonson, that you will keep our secret safe. That you won't expose Shakespeare... \n[99]I have seen it in your face... He vexes you. How could he not? But he is not your burden. He is mine. \n[100]All my writings. The plays, the sonnets... Keep them safe. Keep them from my family. From the Cecil's. Wait a few years, and then, publish them. \n[101]I have made it my life to know the character of men, Jonson. I know you. You may have betrayed me, but you will never betray my words...

Of course I've bloody well been-- \n[4]Plays? Which would you prefer, my lord? A pastoral? An historical? An historical-pastoral, or an hysterical historical pastoral-- \n[5]I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I know whereof you speak. I have had the honor of meeting his lordship-- \n[6]Seditious? Seditious?! It's a comedy for god's sake! There's nothing seditious about-- \n[7]Because I wrote the bloody thing!      And- - \n[8]A pox on you! And your carbuncled father! \n[9]And who are you? \n[10]And where are we going? \n[11]My lord... \n[12]It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord. \n[13]I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you. \n[14]My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned? \n[15]Thank you, my lord. \n[16]Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy-- \n[17]A play, my lord? \n[18]Stage? \n[19]My name, my lord? \n[20]Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire play, my lord. I know how difficult-- \n[21]And you want... me to apply my name to this play? \n[22]All of them? \n[23]My lord-- I really-- \n[24]My lord? \n[25]Hello?   My lord?! I-- \n[26]How in blazes should I know? \n[27]I read a line or two-- I promised Henslowe I'd finish \"Eastward Ho\" by Saturday. \n[28]I tell you Will-- I came to London to become a great poet, to, to, be the conscience of our times, the soul of our age! To change the world, not to become someone else's-- \n[29]Yes, why not? Why can't a man change the world with words? \n[30]\"I can make you the most popular and the richest playwright in all of London.\" Ballocks! I can do that myself, thank you very much. \n[31]Not half--?! You're an actor, what in God's name do you know about writing?! He's an amateur, Will, a complete and utter amateur. Last week gardening, this week playwrighting, next week hawking. No. I won't do it. It would be an affront against the Muses... \n[32]What, you think my name can be bought, if the number's great enough, do you? \n[33]who guiltily looks away.   Marlowe's mouth is open, his hands stop applauding. \n[34]My lord, I thought that-- \n[35]My lord, your voice is completely different than mine. My, my, my characters are-- \n[36]All, my lord? Is that possible? \n[37]It's really not that difficult, if you try. \n[38]You can't play Romeo. \n[39]So bloody well act like a writer! And for God's sake, keep off the stage. Writers don't have time to act. \n[40]Think you so? Have you ever tried? \n[41]Looks over to Oxford with astonishment... While on stage the world sees for the first time \"Hamlet\" contemplating suicide. \n[42]Perhaps they haven't noticed.. \n[43]You informed on one of your own?   To the Tower? \n[44]Why are you here, Kit? \n[45]You've had too much to drink, Kit. You're beginning to sound like one of your plays. \n[46]You reported on me as well, didn't you, Kit? Last year. That's why I was arrested, wasn't it? Because you went to the Tower? \n[47]What's all that, then? \n[48]is stunned. \n[49]More--? You already make more than any playwright Bankside. \n[50]Your work? \n[51]Impossible. \n[52]I'll take that bet!!   Eight shillings on the bear, six dogs! \n[53]You'll have to make do with what you've got. I won't be your beggar. \n[54]Or what? You'll slit my throat like you did Kit's? \n[55]I know he went to see you last night, Will. And I know he was planning to expose you if you didn't agree to his terms. \n[56]Be careful, Will. You kill me off too, and you won't have any good plays to act in after this is all done. \n[57]Right!? Not without right? You went to him, didn't you? You lying knave-- you went to him! \n[58]What? You've already killed off one competitor. Now you want another dead as well? \n[59]I swore to him I wouldn't tell you his name. Swore it! Do you have any idea what he might do to me? Do you? \n[60]He's not even a writer you know. He can't even-- \n[61]Unhand me! \n[62]Here! A quill! A quill! \n[63]Go on, Will. Write something for us. Now. Go on! Amaze us with your verse. Your wit! No? Try astounding us with the letter \"E\". Or an \"I\"-- it's just a straight line! \n[64]Burbage. Wonderful theater. Wonderful! The best Bankside! But only one performance? Is it that bad? \n[65]Free? \n[66]My best so far. I guarantee more than one performance. Though I'll not pay for the tickets myself. No need to. \n[67]I... There is a-- there is a play to be performed... on Monday. \n[68]Yes, my lord, but this one is to be performed one performance, and one performance only. On Monday. All Bankside is talking of it. The History of King Richard the Third. By William Shakespeare. \n[69]He kills his brother the king, and half the royal family to get the throne for himself-- \n[70]Yes. Of course you do. But in William Shakespeare's version, he is played as a hunch-back. \n[71]Waiting?     Waiting for what? \n[72]looks over to Oxford's box.   It's empty. \n[73]This is what Essex is waiting for-- Oxford is bringing him a mob. \n[74]I don't know, I don't know! But, the Tower-- Cecil, he already knows. He knows! I-- I have to warn them! \n[75]is in the middle of the uncontrolled mob.   He spots Francesco nearby. \n[76]runs with the crowd, trying to escape. \n[77]is in the middle of it. \n[78]Will!   Will Shakespeare! \n[79]So!    Off to the palace are you? \n[80]A command performance for our new king! Even in bloody Scotland they've heard of bloody Will Shakespeare, have they? Fraud. Charlatan. Counterfeiter of wit! Murderer! \n[81]It was your husband who sent for me, madam. \n[82]Excuse me, your grace. \n[83]I find... your words... the most wondrous ever heard on our stage.    On any stage... Ever. \n[84]You are the soul of the age... \n[85]My lord? \n[86]I am not worthy of this charge, my lord. I... I betrayed you... I told them of your-- \n[87]Ruin? Dishonor? Madam. You, your family, me, even Elizabeth herself shall be remembered solely because we had the honor to live whilst your husband put ink to paper. \n[88]To the Earl of Southampton.

Why would I lie? Is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than I? \n[93]He was something I could never be. An undeniable perfection... that plagued my soul... And to him I was... nothing. A messenger. Nothing more. \n[94]I am afraid that this is not possible, my lord. \n[95]opens the box. ", "WILLIAM CECIL": "\n[1]We hope not too soon, majesty, we hope not too soon. \n[2]That is God's decision, your majesty. Not mine. \n[3]So! I am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the Earl of Essex... \n[4]Don't think because I was in London, I didn't know exactly what went on here in my absence. \n[5]Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? We will have to deal with Essex soon. His ambitions are becoming a nuisance. \n[6]Now tell me about the play. \n[7]Of course he did. But what was it about? \n[8]...And dancing asses? \n[9]Edward... Have you any idea what you have-- No, how could you... \n[10]And do you know how long it took me to banish them from her presence? She adores them! Adores them! And Edward knows it. Mark my words, Robert, he has done this for a purpose. \n[11]What purpose indeed? But through your carelessness I must now deal not only with Essex, but Edward as well. For whether in shadow or in person, Edward has returned to Court! \n[12]Robert. \n[13]Robert! Come here. \n[14]I am sorry, my lord. But my son Robert prefers the company... of himself... \n[15]May I present my wife, Lady Cecil, and my daughter, Anne. \n[16]Because the Queen has bade it so. My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so. \n[17]To that end, I have the honor of introducing you to your tutors. Seven to eight you shall be tutored in French by Mister Crane-- \n[18]Nine to ten is Greek with Mister Simmons. \n[19]And you know your uncle, Mister Golding, who has petitioned me to allow you to assist him in his translations of ancient Latin texts into English. \n[20]Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing. \n[21]This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God. \n[22]Not in this household. \n[23]King Philip of Spain sees the current Catholic revolt in Ireland as a weakness of ours. A weakness to be exploited.... \n[24]There are rumors of his sending financial aid, and even troops. We must act quickly. We must replace the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and send additional troops immediately, majesty. \n[25]I would recommend the Earl of Essex, your majesty. \n[26]As long as the present crisis warrants, majesty. \n[27]I only recommend we send your most able subjects where they are most needed, majesty. Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you. \n[28]Of burning you at the stake as a heretic. Give him a foot-hold in Ireland, and-- \n[29]Essex's martial abilities are, in my opinion, the only antidote to the plague of Philip. Though, Essex would not, unfortunately, be able to remain in the Privy Council if he is in Ireland... \n[30]Sir Robert Cecil. \n[31]He is my own advisor first, my son second, majesty. His counsel has been invaluable to me, and no doubt will be to you as well. \n[32]Murdered! \n[33]By your own hand! \n[34]He was doing my bidding! \n[35]Of course. As soon as Robert informed me that you were disobeying my express-- \n[36]Enough! Thou shalt not worship false idols in my household! Your everlasting soul hangs in the balance. Not poems. Your soul! \n[37]You have placed me in a grave position, Edward. \n[38]I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. But... I wish something in return. \n[39]My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters... \n[40]Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses. \n[41]No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block. \n[42]appears triumphant.   He looks beaming over to... \n[43]\n[44]Where is her majesty? \n[45]No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly. \n[46]Our authority comes from Elizabeth and from God! Elizabeth! Elizabeth is the key to all. \n[47]Robert... You must think deeper. You must compensate. Compensate for your... malformations... with the gifts God did grant you... With cunning. With ruthlessness. \n[48]From King James of Scotland. \n[49]James knows of the Queen's affection for Essex... and the rumors of his birth. He is justly concerned. You will reply to him. \n[50]I am dying, Robert-- We both know this to be true. And I will not witness the next coronation. \n[51]Help me to my bed, my son. If we are to secure your place at the side of the next king, you must get that king his throne, not I. \n[52]You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. And then tell him Essex will not return from Ireland alive. \n[53]This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. But we must do one thing more... \n[54]Like Essex, Edward must be removed. \n[55]He uses the tools at his disposal, as we use the tools at ours. But ours will win... as they always have. \n[56]Edward seeks what we seek.   To choose the next King. \n[57]Are you certain? \n[58]Marry him, your grace? He is already married. \n[59]Can you? \n[60]Most of the Catholic princes of Europe wish to topple you and end your Protestant reign... The only things that stop them are the channel, and the hope that they might marry you, and thereby achieve your realm through other means. \n[61]Would you risk your throne for him? Would you risk England for him? \n[62]We must do as we have done before... You must go on Progress, somewhere isolated, accompanied by only those whom you most trust. \n[63]After the birth, I will find a suitable house for the child to be reared in. \n[64]He must never know. \n[65]I am praying. \n[66]She's on Progress. \n[67]The Queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart, Edward. If she had, she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure. \n[68]You must have known her eye would move elsewhere, Edward. It always has. You are neither the first, nor the last, of her lovers. \n[69]Go back to my daughter, Edward. She will accept you with open arms, as she always has. Behave as your great title demands you behave. Tend to your estates, your investments. And make me a grandson, an heir! \n[70]I cannot be certain, majesty, when the... relationship began. \n[71]But sometime soon after your return to Court. \n[72]They-- they haven't been very discreet, majesty. I presume he wanted you to know. To... to hurt you. \n[73]Majesty, there is more. The lady is pregnant. \n[74]Your whore gave birth last week. \n[75]The Queen has decided to release you. It seems time does indeed heal all wounds. These are her conditions for your release. One. You will not acknowledge the child. Two. You will never see the mother again. Three. You will avoid Court at all costs. Her majesty would prefer not to be reminded of you in any way ever again. \n[76]No. You have the freedom of the kingdom. Just not of the Court. Those are her terms. Here are mine. You will go back to my daughter. You will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life, and accept the responsibilities of your great title. \n[77]I don't know if the whore has even delivered the-- \n[78]The other one? Who told you? \n[79]There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the... mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead... \n[80]Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well.

You may tell your master that her majesty-- \n[4]He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny him-- \n[5]It-- it was an anonymous gift. Essex insisted it be performed, just to spite me in front of Court... \n[6]About? Some nonsense about fairies and cherubs. \n[7]Father...    It was just a play... \n[8]Purpose?    What purpose? \n[9]He butchered you! \n[10]Not only in front of Court! But the entire City as well! We must arrest this Shakespeare and- \n[11]But we cannot maintain our authority if the mob thinks us laughing stocks-- \n[12]I will reply to him? \n[13]Edward? \n[14]I-- I don't understand, father.

If nothing else, it will give him an opportunity to respond to all these rumors. \n[17]I'm sorry, majesty, I thought you'd heard. \n[18]Essex is in negotiations with Philip of Spain... \n[19]Majesty-- it is said that Essex has promised Phillip all of Catholic Ireland in return for... \n[20]Spain's support of Essex's claim to the throne of England... \n[21]It is, as of yet, just rumor. \n[22]Robert, majesty. \n[23]My father's death has been a great loss for us all... \n[24]No. Unfortunately for us, your majesty, he is quite sane. He simply believes he is your royal equal. \n[25]You, you are the sun, majesty.   The glory of-- \n[26]Which one, your majesty? \n[27]Yes... your majesty. \n[28]His grace, the Earl of...

Didn't you think I knew? Of course I knew, Edward. My father told me all his secrets. All of them. Though the most fascinating was not made known to me until after his death. \n[34]He hated you, Edward, how he hated you. And yet he married his only daughter to you. I never knew why, until I read his last letter to me. \n[35]No, Edward.   He wanted his grandson to be a king. \n[36]Elizabeth had several children, Edward, not just yours. She was sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary was still Queen, and our future Gloriana was out of favor. No one thought her very important at all. Except my father, of course. And when her first child was born, a male, my father took it, and hid it. The grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman. John De Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task. \n[37]Do I? Why do you think he worked so hard to become your guardian after your father died? He had it all planned years in advance. He would teach you everything he knew about statecraft, marry his daughter, and, after Elizabeth's death, proclaim you heir. His own grandchild to follow you on the throne. But he couldn't possibly predict what kind of failure you would become. How you would fail in politics, ignore your estates to the point of bankruptcy, all to write... Poetry. Or that you would commit incest. \n[38]Delicious isn't it? Right out of a Greek tragedy. \n[39]What?  Slept with her son? I don't think she ever knew, to tell you the truth. Though you never know with the Tudors. They all have had such strange tastes in bed-fellows. You could have been a king, Edward. And your son after you. Except for the fact that... you were you. \n[40]I want a fair trial for Southampton... Evidence, witnesses, no false confessions. It must be above reproach. Though with a guilty verdict of course. Oh, and Pole-- If there is any mention of that play-- \n[41]--Make certain the secretaries refer to it as Richard the Second. There will be no mention of hunchbacks in the official record... \n[42]Majesty, I-- \n[43]is watching James. His face betrays his proud feelings. All of Robert Cecil's desires have come true.

We sail in an hour. \n[27]I ask for your blessing, Edward. \n[28]If he is to be my king, then it is my sacred duty to be with him in battle. \n[29]I am sorry to have disturbed your entertainment. \n[30]Robert! \n[31]She can't believe this... \n[32]It's Robert Cecil.

The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! Our Shakespeare, rise... Our Shakespeare... For he is all of ours, is he not? The most performed playwright of all time! The author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language. And yet... And yet... Not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand. In four hundred years, not one document-- be it poem, play, diary or even a simple letter. He was born the son of a glove-maker, and at some unknown time, armed with but an elementary school education, he went to London where, the story goes, he became an actor and eventually a playwright. \n[2]He died at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife and two daughters who were, like Shakespeare's own father, irrefutably illiterate. \n[3]Is it possible Shakespeare owned no books at his death because... he could not read? That he wrote no letters because he, like his father before him and his children after him, could not write? Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost; his biography made not by history... but by conjecture. His story not written with facts, but with... imagination. \n[4]So! Let me offer you a different story. A darker story... Of quills and swords. Of power and betrayal. Of a stage conquered, and a throne lost! \n[5]O-- for a muse of fire... that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention... \n[6]A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene! \n[7]Let us, ciphers to this great accompt, on your imaginary forces work. \n[8]Robert Cecil remained the most powerful man in the Court of King James, though he could not prevent the public theaters from becoming ever more popular. William Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining years of his life not in the playhouses of London, but in the small town of his birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a businessman and grain merchant. \n[9]Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be the most celebrated playwright of his time, becoming England's first Poet Laureate. And in 1623, he wrote the dedication to the collected works of the man we call William Shakespeare. And so... though our story is finished, our poet's is not. For his monument is ever-living, made not of stone but of verse, and it shall be remembered... as long as words are made of breath and breath of life.
