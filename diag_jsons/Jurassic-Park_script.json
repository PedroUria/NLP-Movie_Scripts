What's this tell me? \n[2]It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid. \n[3]So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress fractures in the heel ... \n[4]Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she jump? \n[5]Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young? \n[6]The science of paleontology can't answer these questions.  Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations.  What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice. \n[7]Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches.  Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys. \n[8]Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure. Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie. \n[9]- at a critical time - \n[10]- enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. All right, all right.  Good. \n[11]Financial with the enemy?    I'll do it. \n[12]This is all could come up with, Skip? \n[13]Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie. \n[14]What is, Ellie?  Where are we going? \n[15]Looks like Alcatraz. \n[16]Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe. \n[17]Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing, Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you! \n[18]Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park? \n[19]Hammond's trademark. \n[20]I hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting. \n[21]Where's Hammond? \n[22]- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. \n[23]Here we go. \n[24]No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike the commercialization of science.  It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method. \n[25]Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha public reaction.  Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not. \n[26]Who makes a windows ... smaller? \n[27]Don't worry - he'll grow out of it. \n[28]What exactly do you mean ... biological attractions? \n[29]Yes? \n[30]We don't have the science.  There's no source of dinosaur DNA. \n[31]Like mosquitos - \n[32]Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA \n[33]It does? \n[34]But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand. \n[35]Okay, you have your \"complete\" DNA strand.  How do you grow it? \n[36]And how do you know what it is you're growing? \n[37]That's why you create the mist. \n[38]What kind of eggs are these?  Are these shells plastic? \n[39]Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own judgments. \n[40]I like to wait and see. \n[41]Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this! \n[42]Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives? \n[43]Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones that are extinct now. \n[44]It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's a poison ... \n[45]Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie, look at this. \n[46]These'd give anybody a stomachache. \n[47]Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good work, Timmy. \n[48]Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food.  Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones.  And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough, \n[49]But with th and probably bypasses any mucosal contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I would test her excrement. \n[50]Soil samples? \n[51]Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open. \n[52]Where is the T- \n[53]Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs. \n[54]Then where is she? \n[55]He's here. \n[56]There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct. \n[57]Is that still the T-Rex paddock? \n[58]What's the commotion? \n[59]Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis?? \n[60]We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away.  How far is it to the mainland? \n[61]I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica. \n[62]Timmy, be quiet. Don't move. \n[63]Can't think of a thing. \n[64]Don't move. \n[65]Shut that flashlight, Tim! \n[66]Lex, are you okay? \n[67]Let ... go ... please. \n[68]Timmy.  Are you ok? \n[69]Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down. \n[70]Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow. \n[71]Crawl this way.  Slowly. \n[72]We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy.  Okay? \n[73]One, two, three, jump. \n[74]You owe me one. \n[75]Where'd Lex go? \n[76]Come on out now, Lex. \n[77]Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight.  Why don't you come out? \n[78]I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go. \n[79]Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back to civilization. \n[80]It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see him.  Evidently, he can only see move- ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still. \n[81]Let's go! \n[82]Okay, Lex. \n[83]Oof!  You're heavy. \n[84]I think we're still in his paddock. \n[85]What? \n[86]What? \n[87]No. \n[88]Okay with the fence, Timmy? \n[89]A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent. \n[90]Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland. \n[91]Up there. \n[92]Sure you can. \n[93]I don't think so.  She's a ... \n[94]Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones. \n[95]Tim, I think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there. \n[96]Go home now.  Home to Freda! \n[97]Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here! \n[98]We gotta get to that motion detector. It's still a ways. \n[99]What is it? \n[100]Come on. \n[101]They're agitated. \n[102]Outta the way, kids! Run! \n[103]We'll walk by the river.  That leads back to the Visitor's center. \n[104]You ready? \n[105]What raft? \n[106]It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at least ten miles to go.  If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress. \n[107]Lex, I don't see any raft. \n[108]Bullseye! \n[109]No raft. Where did you see it, Lex? \n[110]Assumed? \n[111]I'm afraid there's no raft. \n[112]Looks pretty calm. \n[113]No. \n[114]There's a current. \n[115]I'm not sl \n[116]Guess I was wrong. \n[117]Hold on real tight. \n[118]I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! .... \n[119]No!!!!! \n[120]I think they cut the power.  Hey - \n[121]Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go, kids. \n[122]Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up. \n[123]Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go. \n[124]Actually, stay here. \n[125]No, keep an eye on things round here for me.  I'll be back with the others. \n[126]I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody.    You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok? \n[127]Be right back. \n[128]Ellie, I'm go glad - \n[129]Talk, Ellie, just keep talking. \n[130]Timmy, you know anything about computers? \n[131]Ok good, you're elected. \n[132]Okay, we've reached the computer room. Who can te \n[133]Tim, you got to book the system.  They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship. \n[134]If we can get help very soon. \n[135]Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here. \n[136]Don't mention it.  It was Timmy. \n[137]Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne? \n[138]Report your position! \n[139]Try this for identification, Captain Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen biological materials.  If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy? \n[140]Do you copy, Captain Farrell? \n[141]Who the hell knows? \n[142]Well it gives us ten more hours. Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing. \n[143]And then there were none. \n[144]We have to leave now. \n[145]You interrupted natural law.  There are regulations, that make her knowable. \n[146]Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire solar system in interlocking motion.  Our own beings in biological step with it all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done! \n[147]Don't count on it.  Now get in. \n[148]You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence. \n[149]You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation. \n[150]You park is doomed.  Now come with me.  \n[151]Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over! \n[152]I have a theory. \n[153]I think that they could never completely ", "HAMMOND": "\n[1]Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions.  Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago.  When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations. Today, the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions:  the headlong and furious haste to un of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers. \n[2]Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history.  It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman.  Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment. \n[3]\n[4]... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is made possible through the miracle of DNA replication, commonly known as cloning. To explain what cloning means, I'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond. \n[5]Hi, John. \n[6]Okay John, hold out your finger. \n[7]I need some of your \n[8]Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body.  You have a hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a couple. \n[9]John, let's look into your blood, the river of life.  There's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell.  This nucleus has an amazing property.  It can sp That's how it grows.  And then those two can do it again.  And again.  Making copy after copy of itself. \n[10]Come on, that's enough of this!  And I thought to reproduce myself I had to do it the old-fashioned way. \n[11]That's all we've got so far.  A lot of fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro? \n[12]It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment.  Popular science - \n[13]Well, I don't disregard method.  But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level.  Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection. Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's true that I have never been afraid to make money with science.  I've always considered profit to be a measure of success, a barometer of public reaction. \n[14]Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan Grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture.  I look forward to winning you over, Dr. Grant. \n[15]I'm aware of that.  But I built this place for children.  You can't investigate it without their reactions. They're what this place is all about. \n[16]My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind. They're more like my ex-wife than me. \n[17]Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked, poorly funded plan that I've headed. This is a plan to which I committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese.  They love theme parks.  I have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right. \n[18]Jurassic Park is the most advanced amusement park in the world.  We work with genetics - life's essential building blocks - to create new to make biological attractions.  Living attractions.  Attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world. \n[19]As you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent Earth.  And then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until ... now. \n[20]Dinosaurs. I've been cloning dinosaurs! \n[21]Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not a resort, not a scien just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting. \n[22]Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in the grassy plain.  Dilophosaurus above the river.  The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far! \n[23]Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There whatever we could plant them on the island.  A computer to tabulate it all. \n[24]I didn't create them.  I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber. \n[25]Yes ... there is. \n[26]Glitches. \n[27]And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here.  John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me. \n[28]Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this.  We run this place with twenty workers.  This computer does it all.  And it polices each and every single animal out there. \n[29]That's where I will watch the astonished watchers.  Okay, let's go. \n[30]Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal precautions. \n[31]My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and Timmy's someday. \n[32]You're both right.  Amber is our gold. The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The precious course of our genetic material. You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course. \n[33]Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as I speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber.  And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects - \n[34]Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant. \n[35]The extraction room speaks for itself. \n[36]Right.  You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature. So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino- saurs. Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back.  I'm helping them escape from the confined of time. \n[37]Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA.  And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur. \n[38]Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr. Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist. \n[39]Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize. \n[40]You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden. \n[41]It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. \n[42]Our primordial soup. \n[43]There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle. Now who wants to see the real thing? \n[44]Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have no affection for that type of thinking. \n[45]Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now. \n[46]Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you. \n[47]He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to impress that young man. \n[48]Oh, balls. \n[49]A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I have five left? \n[50]Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them properly? \n[51]It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay? \n[52]Wh \n[53]How can you say it so matter-of-factly? The trike's.  You casually accept it, but I never can.  You know what it means when you say \"by the trikes\"?  \"By the trike's\" means that they're out there by the species:  triceratops horridus.  It astounds me every time what I've done here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. I will never be complacent about that. \n[54]Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight?  I certainly don't want to imperil anyone.  But can you give us one more container of food?  Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return.  Could you help us out here?  Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor. \n[55]Look at them.  Leaning out the windows, so eager.  They can't wait to see it. They have come for the danger. \n[56]Damn those people.  They are so negative. \n[57]They comb this island like a bunch of accountants.  They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all. \n[58]It's like the Garden of Eden out there. This is the most beautiful time of day. \n[59]Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be hungry when they get in. \n[60]Slob! \n[61]What's going on, Arnold?  I want those lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren scared. \n[62]Well, I want the computer up.  This is the wrong weekend for glitches. \n[63]Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out? \n[64]Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john? \n[65]Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring back the tour right away.  I don't need any of this! \n[66]I'm sure you'll find them. \n[67]I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for children. \n[68]Missing?  Of course I know they're missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob, let's not get carried away.  We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And that's all that happened.  We're dealing with it.  Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and open.  You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream.  It's very good. \n[69]He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park.  It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up. \n[70]You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle.  The park is actually quite safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage \n[71]Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you seen these?  These are great. \n[72]Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas. \n[73]I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur bingo, hey ... \n[74]Wu says he can make a foot high souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only food we sell, of course. \n[75]Growth hormones. \n[76]Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem. These animals don't last.  There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die.  It's always ... very young. We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure Wu will figure it out.  It's just ... \n[77]But there are deadlines.  The park opens next summer. And it requires full-grown specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time.  But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it. \n[78]I was going to tell you all this myself, Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck.  That's why I wanted you and Dr. Grant island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help me? \n[79]My God, look at this, Arnold. \n[80]They've stampeded ... \n[81]No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon? \n[82]My animals!  My animals! \n[83]Where have you been?  My Rex killed a hadrosaur.  You should be out there, doing something. \n[84]Could he drown in that position?  That's a very valuable animal. \n[85]What the hell is going on? \n[86]You're ruining my ordered, precise park! \n[87]Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it! \n[88]Told him, fix my park, fix my park. \n[89]Do you mean those raptor \n[90]Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure there' five of them there. \n[91]This is why my quarters were specially fortified.  To assist in an emergency just like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round up the workers.  They'll go with us too. \n[92]Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place.  I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again.  And it will be on its feet again. \n[93]Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan. \n[94]Don't you see I've exalted human potential here?  You must see it.  You must feel it.  I called back a life form. Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part of this.  I'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want. \n[95]You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge. \n[96]I know what it's done.  I've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex. I've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday.  What do you say to that? \n[97]I created genetic miracles! \n[98]The merchandise is just a by-product. Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder.  You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not argue.  The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream.  They failed me.  The park, I promise you, is safe.  It really is. \n[99]It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes of labor!  You are one more more negative voice in a You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you. ", "ELLIE": "\n[1]Dr. Grant!

There's the car. \n[6]You know, if ev method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang - \n[7]We're leaving the raptor dig - \n[8]- because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica.

That'll keep 'em alive, but it won't keep 'em happy. \n[21]The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's an instinct.  And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed. \n[22]Alan?  Alan?

Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu. \n[33]No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon. \n[34]Lot of track in college. \n[35]Oh, My God!

They're out there. \n[38]Looks like you've been through this before. \n[39]Right. \n[40]I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few tests in his lab. \n[41]No sign of those berries.  Really interesting.  There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample. But it's not in the ground.  Could I look at some of the discarded embryos? \n[42]And yet from what Harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms - besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums. \n[43]Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?

He ripped a boy's arm off before I could get a bullet in him. \n[3]John, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps.  Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers.  We should terminate the raptor program.  They're just too smart.  Too damn smart. \n[4]John, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices? that blow out electric nets.  They're all too slow for these guys. If we're going to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles and laser-guided devices. \n[5]Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence. And wear your rifle when you're working! \n[6]Just checking in.  Everything ok? \n[7]That's what I'm afraid of. \n[8]John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut the power? \n[9]Get out, get out!  I need this jeep. There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in. \n[10]Strong legs. \n[11]Ellie! \n[12]Wait up. \n[13]T-Rex tracks. \n[14]Perhaps. \n[15]I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or exposed bones.  There is usually little or no evidence left behind.  And if are small, a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death, eating it, and leave not so much as a button. \n[16]Thank God.    We have to carry him. First I have to ... \n[17]He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me. \n[18]I told you I've seen big game attacks in Africa. \n[19]We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.

No one would ever miss him. \n[26]Are the fences back on? \n[27]Motion sensors? \n[28]Just hiss. \n[29]What is taking so damn long?  Where are they? \n[30]Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I wish I could go out there   But I haven't got anything to use on the Rex.  My rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry stole.  And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide \n[31]Where the hell are they going? \n[32]Let's see what's up. \n[33]I found Nedry! \n[34]Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap. Hasn't been this well fed ... ever. \n[35]I know it's a valuable animal. \n[36]This doesn't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty, does it? \n[37]All of the fences? \n[38]Including the velociraptor mesh? \n[39]No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh.  But give 'em enough time, they'll get out.  We better get that power on now. \n[40]Relax, it's just refrigerated air. There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle. \n[41]Just go and turn on your generator, then get right back to the control room. \n[42]Raptors chewed their way out.

They'll come running and let Wu get that power on.  Then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible. \n[45]Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot. \n[46]You ok? \n[47]No they're not, Ellie. \n[48]I couldn't compromise everyone's safety. \n[49]You just reset the power.

Trike's sick again. \n[5]It's natural.

They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning. \n[8]Well, at least he knows what he's doing. \n[9]Jesus, the computer's gone \n[10]That's not the worst of it. \n[11]Because Nedry messed with the code. That's why I'm checking it. \n[12]That's true.  Keychecks will give me a record of every button Nedry pushed. \n[13]Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon? He was just dicking around, maybe waiting to get his nerve up. \n[14]Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can trace it. \n[15]It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself.  When he hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off.  Hammond was right about him. \n[16]That's it. \n[17]Right.  And it does something else. It erases the code lines that refer to it.  It destroys all evidence it was ever there. \n[18]Watch this. \n[19]Hot damn! \n[20]You bet they are.  It will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way.

Then I'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them.  But every- thing's working.  Half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running. \n[22]There's a lot of extraneous movement out there.  Branches blowing, birds, back- ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay, count's finished. \n[23]Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're out of range of a sensor. \n[24]Ah hell. I just can't find it. \n[25]Nedry jammed all the communication lines. He inserted some command, a lockout into the program code.  I can't find it, because I gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings. \n[26]Shut the system down? \n[27]I've never done that before.  And I'm reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr systems will come on, but maybe they won't. \n[28]Well, it's just that the safety systems don't function with the computer shut down and - \n[29]Okay. \n[30]You asked for it.  And you got it. \n[31]Thirty seconds. \n[32]Memory should be cleared by now. \n[33]Damn. \n[34]Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches back on before I restart the power. \n[35]Thank God! \n[36]No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually. \n[37]Okay, we're up again! \n[38]Can't be - \n[39]The duckbills. \n[40]It's the Rex ... \n[41]I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond. \n[42]I'm not. \n[43]Can't be. \n[44]I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but I'm going to put it all back together for you - I promise.  I will \n[45]Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge.  The main generator has to be manually reset. \n[46]Backup power doesn't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences, so they were automatically kept off. That's also why we had no phones or radio. \n[47]Yes. \n[48]Yes, yes, yes. \n[49]I'm afraid so. \n[50]What's that steam coming out of my generator room? ", "WU": "\n[1]Finally, you are here!  I've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long.  Welcome, welcome! \n[2]Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science. \n[3]These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers, those are Cray XMP's, supercomputers that take DNA information and organize it.  In this room, we take fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and compare them to other incomplete strands. \n[4]The computers make sever calculations to provide us with a complete DNA strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal. \n[5]We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium. \n[6]Well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is.  If it's something we're interested in, and it keep it. \n[7]This is the incubation room.  We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent. \n[8]We up to thirty-three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away. \n[9]Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all.  The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment. \n[10]Children, please do not touch!  The eggs are permeable to skin oils. \n[11]Yes, they are,  The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room.  But we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born.  Like real births. \n[12]Eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially- designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre-natal developmental stages.  Which is interesting becaus we're having a problem with the adult animals - \n[13]All the security doors are open.  Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed. \n[14]Why? \n[15]But that could take weeks.  What would be faster?  Try keychecks. \n[16]What's that? \n[17]What's it mean? \n[18]If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure Nedry did.  You're find it. \n[19]What is taking Arnold so long?  This room is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged. \n[20]I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a similar one.  All animals carry many viruses almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains. \n[21]What the hell does Harding know?  He's a veterinarian, not a pathologist. \n[22]No point in everyone being exhausted. \n[23]I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as soon as there is light. \n[24]Who gave you permission - \n[25]That's absurd. \n[26]You're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took me many months to learn. \n[27]You're making a lot of assumptions here. \n[28]She didn't have a right to explore my lab. \n[29]Just some adjustment in the code is required. \n[30]So?  Just reset - shut the system down and you'll clear the memory.  Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode. \n[31]And reset. \n[32]Arnold's about to get the phones up. \n[33]My good God. \n[34]What's that, John? \n[35]Looks like you are. \n[36]Print the system status log. \n[37]You shut down as six thirty-four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power. \n[38]Outside?

Some- times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration. But the T-Rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences. Believe me, she can't go anywhere. \n[17]Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today. \n[18]Sure. Rest stop. \n[19]Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't know why not.  Probably too much construction. \n[20]Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary glitch due to the rain.  No doubt, they're going to re-rout some circuits back at the mainframe.  We'll have the power back on in moments.

He's unpredictable, a dreamer. \n[4]The firm owns five percent. \n[5]General. \n[6]It seemed wise at the time.  We all wanted the park to happen.  It was in lieu of fees. \n[7]I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way - \n[8]Hammond asked to place the calls himself. I think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble.  That it's just a social invitation, showing off the island. \n[9]No problem.  Relax, relax. \n[10]Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks. \n[11]Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga- tion of the island, not a weekend excursion or a social outing.

It's wonderful, isn't it? \n[7]Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place. \n[8]Nope. \n[9]Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond. \n[10]Right. \n[11]Coffee anyone? \n[12]Jim, what the hell's with you  ...

I've taken all the lines to upload some data. \n[14]I'll clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir. Here you go now, this will make it all better, Mr. Hammond. \n[15]Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke. Don't touch my console, ok?

It's worth more than the ship. When's the copter meeting you? \n[19]Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like this.  Maybe we should do it another time, I don't like it.  I just don't like - \n[20]Ten hours? \n[21]Ok.  Ok.  Here. \n[22]Look, this is insulating spray. \n[23]In about eight hours, spray down all the eggs with this stuff.

What's our position? \n[4]General or limited? \n[5]We should have never done that. \n[6]In any case, I agree an inspection is \n[7]Will they tell the truth? \n[8]- Good.  You're making all the arrangements? \n[9]All right ... Good.  But let's be very clear about one thing.  I don't know how bad this situation actually is, Donald.

Mr. Regis, where are you going? \n[2]We gonna walk all night? \n[3]We need sleep. \n[4]Climb?  Again?

We truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day.  That's all she touches. \n[3]I'm telling you, the animals don't eat don't eat that stuff. \n[4]I don't get it. \n[5]Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of - \n[6]He's had a lot of morphine. \n[7]He's probably in the control room, get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together. \n[8]You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.
