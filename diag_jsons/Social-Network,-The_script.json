{"dialogues": {"MARK": "\n[1]Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States? \n[2]it is true. \n[3]Well first of all, a lot of people live in China. But here's my question: \n[4]How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's? \n[5]I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here. \n[6]You can sing in an a Capella group. 2. \n[7]Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar \n[8]Or you get into a final club, exactly. \n[9]Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test. \n[10]I'm trying now. \n[11]To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy? \n[12]But you've seen guys who row crew, right? \n[13]Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one. \n[14]The Phoenix is good. \n[15]It's the same topic. \n[16]Would you rather talk about something else? \n[17]We can change the subject. \n[18]It's about exclusivity. \n[19]The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc. \n[20]The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best. \n[21]Theodore. 4. \n[22]Hm. \n[23]why would you ask me that? \n[24]They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that. \n[25]He likes meteorology. \n[26]If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance, \n[27]You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance. \n[28]I just think you asked--the placement of where you asked the question-- \n[29]Erica-- \n[30]Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated. \n[31]Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code. \n[32]I'm saving I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs. \n[33]Because they're exclusive. And fun and they lead to a better life. \n[34]He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do. 6. \n[35]I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet. \n[36]You're my girlfriend. \n[37]What do you mean? \n[38]Is this a joke? \n[39]You're breaking up with me? \n[40]Take it easy. \n[41]It was--Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy. \n[42]I'm from Westchester. \n[43]I apologize, okay? Siddown. \n[44]\n[45]I'm sorry and I mean it.. \n[46]Come on. \n[47]You don't have to study. Let's just talk. \n[48]Why? \n[49]All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to--I wasn't making a comment on your parents--I was saying you go to B.U. \n[50]You don't have to study. \n[51]Because you go to B.U.! ERICA stares at him... \n[52]Do you want to get some food? \n[53]And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat. \n[54]I don't need friends. \n[55]You're really leaving. ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly.. \n[56]The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea. MARK has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled \"Kirkland Facebook\". He clicks and opens it. A menu of photos appear. He blogs again. \n[57]Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he's on to something. \n[58]First u is Kirkland. They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little NGET magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook. Kids' stuff. On the computer screen, we've been seeing him download picture after picture of Harvard girls. \n[59]Next is Elliot. They're also open but with no indexes on Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page. Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along. Flying by at super-speed on MARR's computer screen have been commands and images that the rest of us can't possibly understand. \n[60]Lowell has some security. They require a username/password combo and I'm going to go ahead and say they don't have access to main faa user database, so they have no way of--\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 14, \n[61]Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient. \n[62]Wardo. \n[63]How did you know that? \n[64]Oh yeah. \n[65]I need you. \n[66]No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures. \n[67]We're ranking girls. \n[68]To watch the bottom 200's heads explode. \n[69]Let's write it. \n[70]Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to? \n[71]It's not a coincidence. \n[72]Yeah, \n[73]That's not what happened. \n[74]No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that? That I said that stuff to her? \n[75]why would you even need to depose her? \n[76]You think if I know she can make me look like a. jerk I'll be more likely-- \n[77]--to settle, right? 24, \n[78]Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath. People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. MARK stays in his seat. MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who's on Mark's legal team is still sitting too... about four seats down from Mark. \n[79]Eighty. \n[80]Uh...I've, you know, I've apologized in the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted as I take it they were by the things that have been said tome in the last week. As for any charges stemming from the breach of security, I believe I deserve some sort of recognition from this Ad Board. \n[81]Yes. \n[82]Which part? \n[83]I pointed-out some pretty gaping holes in your system. \n[84]Four hours? \n[85]Six months academic probation. They walk out onto-- \n[86]No it couldn't. They made me apologize. \n[87]To them. Over and over. \n[88]No. \n[89]I shouldn't have said the thing about the farm animals. That was stupid. Everybody's mad at me now. 30, \n[90]1 valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits. 31. MARK walks out of the lecture hall and we \n[91]Yeah. \n[92]\n[93]Did I insult your girlfriends? What can I do for you? \n[94]You guys look like athletes. \n[95]Yeah, I've got a minute. \n[96]No. \n[97]Hi. 33. \n[98]Yeah . \n[99]Yeah. \n[100]An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music. \n[101]Microsoft. \n[102]I didn't sell it. I uploaded it for free. \n[103]\n[104]Yeah. How's this different from MySpace or Friendster? \n[105]Yeah. \n[106]--is exclusivity, Right? \n[107]I'm in. \n[108]I'm in. \n[109]It was three or four years ago, I don't know what I said. \n[110]I don't understand that question. \n[111]The affirmative? \n[112]It was called TheFacebook back then. \n[113]I'm in the middle of two different lawsuits. \n[114]I said I'd help. \n[115]I wouldn't say I approached him. \n[116]It was at a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi. \n[117]The Jewish fraternity. It was Caribbean Night. \n[118]I think I've come up with something. \n[119]What? \n[120]Are you kidding? \n[121]Yeah. \n[122]You got punched by the Phoenix. \n[123]Yeah. \n[124]\n[125]I don't want to stare at that loop of Niagara Falls which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean. \n[126]People came to Facemash in a stampede, right? \n[127]It wasn't because I put up pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls. \n[128]It was because I put up pictures of girls that people knew. So if people Want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't I build a website that offers that? An online community of friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around. All from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online. \n[129]I know, I'm totally pumped about this. \n[130]--it would be exclusive. You'd have to know the people on the site to get in. Like getting punched. 40, \n[131]Like our own Final club except not only can we get into this one, we're the president. \n[132]We're gonna need a little start-up cash to rent'the servers and get it online. \n[133]We'll split it 70-30. 70 for me and 30 for you for putting up a thousand dollars and handling everything on the business end. You'll be CFO. \n[134]It probably was a. diversity thing but so what? \n[135]They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo and began a plan to screw him out of the company. \n[136]Jealous of Eduardo? \n[137]Ma'am, I know you've done your homework and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Harvard University, take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my ping pong -room. \n[138]I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache webserver with a mySQL backend. It's gonna cost a little more money. \n[139]Two-hundred more. 46, \n[140]To handle the traffic. \n[141]I already did. \n[142]Good job. You should be proud of that right there, don't worry if you don't make it any further. \n[143]Do you see any of your code on Facebook? \n[144]Did I use any of your code? \n[145]Match-dot-com for Harvard guys? \n[146]You know you really don't need a damn forensic team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook. \n[147]No shit. \n[148]Dustin. People don't walk around with a sign on them that says-- And MARK stops short right there. Because in his head, he's just discovered the cure for cancer. \n[149]I have to add a feature. \n[150]It's clean and simple. No flashing lights. The CAMERA surveys the screen as MARK slips through some functions to show EDUARDO and we see things that are now familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a poke application, etc. \n[151]\"Relationship Status\", \"Interested In\". These two things are what drive life at college. Are you having sex or aren't you. It's why people take certain classes, sit`where they sit, go where they go, do what they do, and at its, um, center,`you know, that's what theFacebook is gonna be about, People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon there's a chance they're gonna- \n[152]--get laid. Yes. \n[153]And that's it. 53. \n[154]It's ready. \n[155]Yeah. \n[156]It's ready, that was it. And here's the masthead, MARK hits another couple of keystrokes and the website's masthead comes up. \n[157]Yeah. \n[158]Yeah. \n[159]Sure I do. \n[160]Right now. Get your laptop out. \n[161]Because you've got e-mails for everyone at the Phoenix. 54, \n[162]It's not Spam. \n[163]If we send it to our friends it'll just bounce around the computer lab, \n[164]These guys know people and these guys know girls. I need their e-mails. \n[165]Let's start with the president. \n[166]Like the Lewis Carrol? \n[167]These guys. \n[168]Think they're literary geniuses because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in their-- \n[169]I'm just saying. \n[170]Okay. He hits \"Send\". \n[171]The site's live. \n[172]A family of means? \n[173]I'm not sure why you're asking me that. \n[174]It's not important to you. \n[175]I had no idea whether they came from money or not. 64, \n[176]or roughly the amount I paid in income tax last year, go on. \n[177]They made a point of pointing that out. \n[178]Yes. \n[179]I hadn't heard, tell me more. \n[180]They want to have drinks later. \n[181]Yeah. \n[182]Sure. \n[183]Thanks. \n[184]How you doin'. \n[185]I doubt it. 69. \n[186]It was Bill Gates. \n[187]Those Asian girls were cute. What were their names? \n[188]When? \n[189]What does that mean? \n[190]No I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it? \n[191]No. What were their names? \n[192]'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's \n[193]We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, what it can be, what it will be. We know it'\u00e2\u0080\u00a2s cool, that's a -priceless asset and we're not giving it up. EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something sitting on top of a pile of'books.,, \n[194]What, EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary. \n[195]I think it's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names? \n[196]About 10 days ago. Right after we \n[197]I liked th shorter one. \n[198]I find that to be mildly annoying. \n[199]\n[200]It was addressed to me. \n[201]What? \n[202]I'm not. \n[203]What are you, my mother? 72. \n[204]No, it says I could face legal action. \n[205]The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not, \n[206]Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one. \n[207]I didn't think. it was a big deal.. \n[208]No, \n[209]I went to a 3-L at Student Legal services and he told me to write them back. \n[210]I'd raised concerns before. \n[211]Yeah. \n[212]No. \n[213]It's snowing. \n[214]It just started snowing. \n[215]No. \n[216]I had to swear an oath before we began the deposition phase and I don't want to get arrested for perjury so I have a legal obligation to say no. \n[217]The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my employees and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question? GAGE just looks casually at MARK. MARK doesn't meet his gaze, or the looks from DIVYA, TYLER and CAMERON... \n[218]I'll be right back. \n[219]Erica? ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to see MARK. She's looking sexy for her Friday ni.ght on the town and the three guys she's with are studs. A few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth. \n[220]I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot. \n[221]Mine too. It's not bad. It's not. great. The music's kind of lame. Could I talk to you alone for a second? \n[222]okay. MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth. \n[223]I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched. \n[224]ThePacebook? \n[225]I'm really sorry about that. 78. \n[226]That's why I came over. \n[227]I don't want to. \n[228]I came over to say I was sorry for all that and to see if there was any chance-- \n[229]Okay. \n[230]I think you're wrong. \n[231]Okay. MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing at and watching from a distance with JENNY. \n[232]We have to expand. \n[233]We have to expand. And MARK heads out the door. EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls and answers the un-asked question-- \n[234]We're expanding theFacebook to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share. the coding work with me. Chris, you're going to be in charge. of publicity and outreach. You can start by getting a story about the expansion in the B.U. student newspaper. \n[235]Because I do. Here's the business arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company, Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions? \n[236]No. That's it. Yale and Columbia, let's go. \n[237]What? \n[238]No. \n[239]No thank you. \n[240]who are you? \n[241]I mean what do you do? \n[242]Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia. \n[243]I wasn't asleep. \n[244]They're not gonna card us. \n[245]Are you gonna talk about ads again? \n[246]This isn't a business. \n[247]He's a god, he can be as late as he wants. \n[248]What is he? \n[249]He also founded'the companies. \n[250]He's here. SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is. saying hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress. \n[251]Great to meet you. 101. \n[252]Tell me about the strategy you're using. \n[253]Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles and put theFacebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site and we were in. \n[254]Exactly. \n[255]I said exactly that. \n[256]Shit. 105. \n[257]You want to end the party at eleven. \n[258]There won't be a party unless it's cool. What'd you think? \n[259]I meant catching the marlin instead of the 1.4 trout. Doesn't that sound good? \n[260]They identify you as-- \n[261]--one of the founders of Facebook. \"Junior Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook, wa.s-- --I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business. \n[262]This is scathing. \n[263]I'm gonna have to answer for this. \n[264]Alright, let's just forget about it. 209. \n[265]T. have my final coming up for \"Postwar and Contemporary Art\" and I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings. \n[266]Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment. Every once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going, it's beautiful. \n[267]Oops. \n[268]We're gonna need more money, Wardo. \n[269]---and I want to hit that coal by the end of the summer. I'm interviewing people tomorrow--two interns to come to Palo Alto for the summer and we're-gonna have to pay them something. \n[270]I already found a house for rent on a street two-blocks.from the Stanford campus. It's a piece of junk but it's perfect and it's got a pool. \n[271]You mean when did I actually decide? \n[272]He was right. California's the place we've gotta be. \n[273]What's your problem with Sean? \n[274]He's got connections to the VCs. \n[275]The real players and-- \n[276]--as someone who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way-- \n[277]Bang on. Hit refresh. DUSTIN hits \"refresh\" on the desk-top computer. Then smiles... \n[278]150,000 members, Wardo. \n[279]Congratulations. 112. \n[280]Who came up with nothing. \n[281]We don't know any of that's true. \n[282]And you can read about you torturing birds. \n[283]I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in t}y CS lab. Get on board with this or not. \n[284]They have 10 minutes to get 'root access to a Python webserver, expose its SSL encry\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdti_on and then intercept all traffic over its secure port. \n[285]All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty. \n[286]Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot. And hacking's supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot. I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers--the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot. 114, \n[287]What's this? \n[288]welcome to Facebook. The place ERUPTS. The pretty ASIAN GIRL hits an mp3 player that's been hooked up to speakers and a Dr. Dre song blares out--\"California, it's time to party...\" The two winners are hugging each other and getting wild congratulations from the crowd. 115. MARK looks back at EDUARDO and smiles...EDUARDO gives him a pat on the back and we \n[289]Hang on. MARK's scratching something out on a pad... \n[290]You sure? \n[291]Is anything broken? \n[292]I didn't know we had a doorbell. \n[293]Andrew. \n[294]Good boy. MARK gets to the door and opens it. He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON. They all look at each other for a moment--- \n[295]Sean? \n[296]Yeah. Do you? \n[297]Yeah. \n[298]No. You live across the street. \n[299]Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool. \n[300]Yeah. \n[301]Here you go. A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it. \n[302]He's wired in. \n[303]He's got an internship in New York. \n[304]I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you. \n[305]Your date looks so familiar to me, \n[306]What do you mean? ].21. \n[307]I know everything there is to know about you Sean. \n[308]He has an internship. \n[309]In New York. \n[310]Yes. \n[311]It'd be great if you stayed at the house with us. \n[312]We want: to . be in a hundred schools. \n[313]What? \n[314]Yeah. \n[315]Wardo. \n[316]What time is it? \n[317]You've gotta see some of the new stuff we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm just calling it the wall. 132. \n[318]Thiel may want to make an angel, investment. \n[319]You've had a long flight. \n[320]Sure. \n[321]How's it going? How's the internship? How's Jenny? \n[322]Yeah. \n[323]I do remember you saying that. \n[324]How's Jenny? \n[325]That can be fun. \n[326]Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend. 134 , \n[327]You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening. \n[328]The con etions, the energy- \n[329]--the creativity. \n[330]We've got over 300,000 members, we're in \n[331]--five in Europe. \n[332]We need more servers than I ever imagined we'd need. We need more programmers. We need more'money. He set uV the Thiel meeting. He's set up meetings all around town. \n[333]Yes. \n[334]You're in New York! 135. \n[335]How's it going so far?!! EDUARDO looks at MARK for a long moment before we \n[336]That's comforting. The office door opens and PETER THIEL sticks his head out-- \n[337]You froze our account? in the background there's a small celebration going on with SEAN, DUSTIN, the INTERNS and of course some GIRLS. Champagne is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls. are dancing to triumphant music. \n[338]Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have easily destroyed everything I've been working on? \n[339]Without money, the company can't function. What EDUARDO can't see behind his back is that JENNY has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter. \n[340]If the servers are down for even a day, our reputation is damaged irreversibly,. Users are fickle. Friendster has proven that fact. And JENNY's now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks the basket over with her foot. \n[341]Even a small exodus, even a few people leaving would reverberate through the whole user base. The users are interconnected, that's the whole fucking point! College kids are online because their friends are online and if one \n[342]--goes, all the dominos go! Do you get that?! I'm not going back to Caribbean Night at the Jewish fraternity! \n[343]Did you like being nothing?! Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a pasty- faced geek?! You wanna go back to that?! \n[344]That was the act'of a child, not a businessman. And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend, You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check? And I was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in front of a girl. I'm not going back to that life, \n[345]Okay, maybe you were angry, maybe you were frustrated. I'm ready to let, uh, to let bygones be bygones because I've got some good news. EDUARDO--with the fire now out--picks up the phone. \n[346]I said I've got some good news. \n[347]Peter Thiel's just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars.. \n[348]A half a million dollars and he's setting us up in an office. They want to re- incorporate the company, they want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO, \n[349]\n[350]EDUARDO clicks the phone shut. \n[351]Peter's gonna throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members, it's gonna be out of control. You've gotta come back for it. \n[352]Yeah. \n[353]Yeah. \n[354]You sure about-this? \n[355]Okay. MARK heads into the office building. 145. SEAN looks up to the windows of a high floor, points, and says-- \n[356]You were told that if new investors came \n[357]You signed the papers. \n[358]You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?! \n[359]That's right. It is. Maybe if you'd spent a little less time with your new friends and a little more time with the company \n[360]Yeah. You were kinda rough on him. \n[361]No. You didn't have to be that rough on him. \n[362]Sean? You didn't have to be that rough on him. \n[363]Ashleigh? \n[364]That's great. I've been, you know, I've been talking to her a little. I don't know, I think she likes me. 152, \n[365]What? \n[366]You can put it on my desk. ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk. \n[367]You'd do that for me? MACKEY hits the \"refresh\" key and the big screen shows-- 1,000,002 CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs him but MARK doesn't quite hug back--he's still hearing what SEAN just said. \n[368]Hello? \n[369]Shit. \n[370]17? Back on SEAN's side- \n[371]This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna. be online any second. \n[372]You know with anunderage intern and-- \n[373]I'll get it under control. I'll call our guys and see what the next move is. But this is gonna be news now. \n[374]Go home, Sean. I'll call our people. MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment. He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's a box. He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He takes one of the business cards out and looks at it. I'm CEO ...Bitoh And over this we HEAR a woman's voice... \n[375]Who would you rather he? 159. \n[376]My lawyer or their lawyer? \n[377]I'm not a bad guy. \n[378]What happens now? \n[379]They're gonna want to settle? \n[380]Why? \n[381]I invented Facebook. 160. \n[382]Likability? \n[383]You think I'm the one who called the police? \n[384]Farm animals? \n[385]I was drunk and angry and stupid. \n[386]Would anyone mind it I stayed and used the computer for a minute? \n[387]Thanks. I appreciate your help today, ", "EDUARDO": "\n[1]What's going on? \n[2]Mark. What's going on? 15, \n[3]Did you and Erica split up? \n[4]It's on your blog. \n[5]Are you alright? \n[6]I'm here for you. \n[7]Are you okay? \n[8]Why? \n[9]You think that's such a good idea? \n[10]Give each.girl a.-base rating of 1400. At any time `Girl All has a rating R-a and \"Girl B\" has a rating R-b. \n[11]Those expectations are expressed this way. \n[12]It works. \n[13]Dwyer. \n[14]Who are you gonna send it to? MARK's made the link to e-mail and hits send. 18, \n[15]Mark? I wonder if maybe you. shouldn't shut it down before you get into trouble. MARK ignores him as we pre-lap a PHONE RINGING and \n[16]You don't think-- \n[17]Go see if it's everybody. DUSTIN, CHRIS and EDUARDO head out of the room. MARX drains what's left of the vodka and lights a cigarette as the guys start coming back in the room. \n[18]I mean ...unless it's a coincidence I think this is-Us, \n[19]Holy shit. \n[20]Well? \n[21]To who? \n[22]It's alright. \n[23]It's okay. You're fine. \n[24]Maybe, but at least everybody knows you now. \n[25]It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls. It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me. \n[26]I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, they're smart, they're not Jewish and they can't dance. \n[27]Mark. MARK sees EDUARDO and waves him over to where he is. He wants to talk privately. \n[28]I'll be back in a minute. EDUARDO joins MARK in the back of the room and they take up a spot next to a bay window that's covered on the outside with ice. \n[29]I got punched by the Phoenix. 38. \n[30]No. I mean it's just the first of the four step process but they slipped the invitation under my door tonight. T go to the first punch party tomorrow and if they like me-- \n[31]--I get the second invitation and then the third and then who knows? \n[32]It was, you know ...I'm sure it was just a diversity thing, And I'm never gonna make it in, it was just a diversity thing. So I'll just ride that'horse until--what did you want to talk about? Mark? \n[33]You said you think you've come up with something. It seems like MARK's just made a small decision in his head, \n[34]It's 20 degrees outside. \n[35]Yeah. \n[36]Yeah. \n[37]I can't feel my legs. \n[38]\"It would be exclusive\". \n[39]This is interesting. \n[40]I told him I thought it sounded great. I mean it did, it was a great idea. There was no reason to hack, people were going to put their own pictures up. What they were interested in, what they were looking for, what classes they were taking... and people had the ability to invite their friends to join. Or put a different way, not invite their friends to join. In a world where social structure is very important, that was sexy. It was a big project and he was going to have to write tens of\u00e2\u0080\u00a2thousands of lines of code so I wondered why'he was coming to me and not his roommates. Dustin Moskowitz and Chris Hughes were programmers. \n[41]That was why. \n[42]I said \"Let's do it\". \n[43]Yes. He said--- \n[44]I'll let you know how the party is, We stay on MARK for a moment longer, his wheels turning, \n[45]Yes sir, \n[46]Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. Uhh, he said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys. \n[47]Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they- --that your clients, probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash did what he wanted it to do. MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as everything is being said within a few feet of the peop\" being talked about. \n[48]Not at the time I wasn't. I am now. \n[49]No I wasn't. MUSIC kicks in that will tie this next section together as we \n[50]\n[51]How much more? \n[52]Do we need it? \n[53]Do it. \n[54]Hey, guess what?  I made the second cut. \n[55]I'll get outa,here. \n[56]I know. \n[57]1) Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638. 2) Harvard wasn't founded by John Harvard and 3) That's not John Harvard. \n[58]A friend of the sculptor, Daniel. Chester- \n[59]Not to my knowledge. \n[60]We were supposed to meet at 9. MARK is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys. \n[61]Have you slept yet? MARK opens the door and they go into his suite-- \n[62]What are you adding? 52, MARK's in his own world as he sits at the computer and calls up theFacebook. The home page fills the screen. \n[63]Shit. That looks good. That looks really good. \n[64]What'd you write?. MARK goes back to the profile page. There's a new area to be filled in... \n[65]--meet a girl. \n[66]Really? \n[67]What do you mean? \n[68]It's ready? \n[69]Right now? \n[70]You made a masthead. \n[71]\"Eduardo Saverin, Co-Founder and CFO.\" \n[72]You have no idea how much that's going to mean to my father. \n[73]When's it gonna go live? \n[74]Why do we need my laptop? \n[75]I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spammed their-- \n[76]I didn't mean Spam, it's not Spam, it's \n[77]I haven't gotten in yet. \n[78]Sure. EDUARDO takes out his laptop-- \n[79]\"Jabberwockl2@Harvard E-D-U.\" \n[80]Yeah. MARK opens up an e-mail and is writing a short message, then includes a link to the site-- \n[81]I know, \n[82]They're not so bad. 55. \n[83]You're right. \n[84]You know what? Let's go get a drink and celebrate. MARK is staring at the computer... \n[85]Mark? MARK doesn't hear him. We just see MARK's head from the back and it's ever so slightly bobbing back and forth... \n[86]Mark? Are you praying? \n[87]You know Mark? \n[88]Yeah. Both of us. It's mine and his. It's our--we're--yes. \n[89]Very nice to meet you. \n[90]Certainly. I'll certainly--absolutely I will do that. EDUARDO turns back to the speaker, who MARK hasn't taken his eyes off of-- \n[91]She said \"Facebook me\" and we can all have a drink later. Which is stunningly great for two reasons. One, she said \"Facebook me\". Right? And the other is that, you know-- \n[92]Yes: Have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one ordinary-sized sentence? A group of guys hustle up to MARK and EDUARDO-- \n[93]It's time to monetize the thing. \n[94]Did you hear what I said? \n[95]I said it's time to monetize the site. \n[96]I mean it's time for the website to generate revenue. 70, \n[97]Advertising. \n[98]We've got 4000 members. \n[99]Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point--and I'm speaking as the business end of the \n[100]Mark, what is this? \n[101]This, \n[102]Who? \n[103]When did you get this? \n[104]Jesus Christ. \n[105]They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea. \n[106]They find it to be property theft. Why-- \n[107]--why didn't you show this to me? \n[108]They're saying we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Wink\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \n[109]Did we? \n[110]Please don't screw around with me now. \n[111]Look at me. \n[112]The letter says we could face legal action. \n[113]It's from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds for-- \n[114]Do they have grounds? \n[115]Why didn't you show me the letter? \n[116]If there's' something wrong--if there's ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I'm the guy who can help. Is there anything you need to tell me? \n[117]What are we doing about this? \n[118]What did you say? \n[119]\"---the lack of hardware we had to deal with, the lack of promotion that was needed to successfully launch the website-- \n[120]Their names were Jenny and Alice- They want to have drinks tonight. \n[121]Shit. 76. \n[122]Oh God. \n[123]Sorry. It'll just be a minute. Some girls are freshening up in there. \n[124]Mark. We have groupies. MARK can't help a smile. Then he sees something... \n[125]Where you going? 77. MARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he can recognize her. She's with a girlfriend and three guys. When he makes it to the booth he says-- \n[126]That was cool, you did good. You talked to her, that was the right thing to do. It was good, Mark. \n[127]What? \n[128]I don't know. \n[129]Why do you want a story in the B.U.--- \n[130]Jenny and Alice, \n[131]Yes. \n[132]As CFO, I'd set up some meetings with potential advertisers. \n[133]It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I'd set up a few months earlier. \n[134]Yes. \n[135]They went terribly. \n[136]Mark was asleep. \n[137]Can I re-phrase my answer? \n[138]I wish he'd been asleep. \n[139].and we're at 29 schools now with over 75,000 members. People who go on theFacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other site and here's the most impressive statistic--67% of people who try it once come back. Now if you'll \n[140]Yes sir. \n[141]Yes. A dinner. It was set up through my girlfriend at the time. \n[142]Yes, very, \n[143]They might. \n[144]It' :l.l be embarrassing, \n[145]\n[146]Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the urpose of a business is to make a profit.' \n[147]That's tough for me because I'm the business head of the company. MARK says nothing... \n[148]He's 25 minutes late. \n[149]He's not a god- \n[150]25 minutes late. \n[151]I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous. \n[152]I didn't know him at all but I'd done an internet search and asked around. He struck me as kind of a wild man. \n[153]He crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in-spectacular fashion and he's got a reputation with drugs. \n[154]We don't need him. \n[155]And he does own a watch. SEAN stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and kiss his girlfriend. It's sort of an incongruous sight--this 22 year old kid who's able to work a room like Sinatra. Who the hell is this? \n[156]Take your time... \n[157]We were waiting for-- \n[158]From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon. I'd never seen anyone perform a monologue at dinner before but that's what happened. \n[159]He took us through his episode with Napster . \n[160]And then he went to his second business venture which was Plaxo, an online rolodex. \n[161]And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley, parties at Stanford and-down in LA, friends who\" d become billionaires--and then he finally got around to theFacebook. \n[162]Well... we're in 29 schools now and we \n[163]Settle an argument for us, would you? I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right? \n[164]You? \n[165]That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking. \n[166]I'm trying to pay for the party. \n[167]Sure, let's drop the \"the\". \n[168]Only if you're a trout. \n[169]That's where my family lives. \n[170]No, \n[171]No. \n[172]No. \n[173]Is this a Doke? \n[174]\n[175]It's bullshit, it's one of the other clubs playing a prank. 107. \n[176]I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been accepted and as part of my initiation I had to, for one week, carry with me at all -Limes and take care of a chicken. \n[177]I wasn't torturing the chicken, I don't torture chickens, are you crazy? \n[178]Listen to me. 108. \n[179]I was having dinner in the Kirkland Dining Hail with Mark and I had the chicken with me because I had to have the chicken with me at all times. This was college. \n[180]The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken so I just...I cut up little pieces,of chicken and gave it to the chicken.'There were a lot of people there and someone must have seen me and the next thing I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism. At the end of the table, MARYLIN'tries but fails to stifle a small laugh. EDUARDO looks down the table... \n[181]i didn't'know you can't do that. I dealt with the various animal rights groups, I dealt with the Associate Dean of the College, it was all fine. \n[182]Someone from the Fly or the Porc must have reported it. For all I know it was the Winklevoss twins who may have been tipped off by somebody else who was there. \n[183]I can't forget about it, I'm being accused of animal cruelty. It's better to be accused of armed robbery. I'm going to have to explain this to my father, I'm going to have to explain this to everyone, I'm going to have to--what is happening on that? EDUARDO's referring to a laptop that's open and displaying images of four paintings. \n[184]Is that a Facebook page? \n[185]I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen. \n[186]Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam and so that's not what friends do. \n[187]bops. You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?! 110. \n[188]I agree. More servers, more apps-- \n[189]What? \n[190]When did you decide to go to California for the summer? \n[191]Somewhere in the middle of The Sean Parker Variety Hour? \n[192]You're Jed Clampett? \n[193]Yes, we got the show in Brazil, it was genius. \n[194]He doesn't bring anything to the table. He doesn't have money, Dustin's a better \n[195]We don't need VCs, we need advertisers and I've got connections to the VCs. \n[196]\n[197]It was the Winklevosses, Mark! \n[198]Congratulations, dude. \n[199]He was obsessed with the guy from Sequoia Capital. He was followed by private detectives. \n[200]Enough to get him out of Plaxo. The drugs, the girls-- \n[201]You can read about it, \n[202]Don't fish eat other fish?! The marlins and the trout?! \n[203]Mark? \n[204]What's goin' on? \n[205]They're hacking. \n[206]You know I didn't understand what you just said, right? \n[207]Can I ask--what part of the interns' jobs will they need to be able to do drunk? \n[208]Here. \n[209]\n[210]Yes. \n[211]Yes. \n[212]Yes. \n[213]Wel1... .I figured we were a team and I wanted to be a team player. I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site while I worked on generating advertiser interest in New York. 13.6. \n[214]And mostly I figured., you know...how much could go wrong in three months? \n[215]What the hell. \n[216]What's up? Mark was supposed to get me at the airport two hours ago, I've been calling his cell. \n[217]What in hell happened here? \n[218]Hey man. \n[219]Flow old are they, Sean? \n[220]How old are they? \n[221]I've read enough. \n[222]I waited an hour for you at the airport. \n[223]It's midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I just came from. \n[224]No. \n[225]Why's he setting up meetings? \n[226]I don't care if he's an actual angel, why's he setting up business meetings? \n[227]No, I've had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, theft a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO and in between there was a long flight. I run the business end of this company, he's a house guest living rent-free on a generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.' \n[228]\n[229]Can I talk to you alone for a minute? 133. \n[230]How's the internship? \n[231]Mark.. .Jesus, I quit the internship. We've talked about this on the phone, were you even--I quit on my first day. \n[232]Yeah, it was a pretty big deal. \n[233]No I mean she's actually psychotic. She's insanely jealous and she's irrational and she's violent. \n[234]I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company. \n[235]Did you hear what I just said? \n[236]\n[237]He's not part of the company. \n[238]I'm aware of that. \n[239]I'm aware of that, Mark, I'm the CFO. \n[240]He's set up other meetings? \n[241]Without me knowing anything about it?! \n[242]Riding subways 14 hours a day to get \n[243]I want to freeze this bank account and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit. \n[244]Hello? --and then the last. hallway. \n[245]Jesus . \n[246]You scared me. I need you to knock first. \n[247]I got back this afternoon. \n[248]Jen, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired and-- \n[249]I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior. \n[250]I brought you a present. \n[251]What? \n[252]I was single when I set up the page. \n[253]\n[254]I don't know how. \n[255]No. Calm down. 138, \n[256]It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that. \n[257]Easy. \n[258]That is not even remotely true and I can promise you that the Silicon valley skanks don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook. Please let me give you your present. EDUARDO's cell phone RINGS-- \n[259]Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open your present. It's a silk scarf. \n[260]This'll be your first. EDUARDO's gotten the gift box out of his half un-packed suitcase, tossed it to JENNY and finally answered the phone. 139. \n[261]Yeah. \n[262]I did. \n[263]I had to get your attention, mark. \n[264]We've been working on. \n[265]\n[266]Holy shit! \n[267]I've got a fire in a my apartment! \n[268]Yeah! \n[269]I'm sorry. It .maybe was angry and it was childish. I needed to get your attention. ].41 . \n[270]What is it? \n[271]What? \n[272]I'm on my way. \n[273]\n[274]Yes. Also I'm breaking up with you. \n[275]How many shares of stock will I own? \n[276]Jesus Christ. \n[277]Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors. \n[278]Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected. \n[279]I can live with that. \n[280]I'm sorry. Could you please repeat the question? \n[281]No. It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyer look over all the-the, uh.. .I thought they were my lawyers. I was a Harvard business major.  I was your only friend. You had one friend. My father won't look at me. \n[282]Well there was a lot of handshaking and congratulations. He'd already told me he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester so we were saying goodbye for a while. And then before I left, he said---- \n[283]A million members. \n[284]Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland? \n[285]Yeah, I'll be here. \n[286]In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party. \n[287]It said that we had to have a business meeting. That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Michael Moritz and Sequoia capital. and that it had impressed Moritz so much that he was making an investment offer that was hard to turn down. \n[288]I went out to California and went straight to the new offices. And it's clear that we're in the offices of a new, high-tech, very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist commissioned for. the job and -tons of young employees. \n[289]Because I wasn't called out there for either one. \n[290]An ambush. \n[291]At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign. But then I started reading. As EDUARDO reads, we rack focus to MARK, who's sitting at a computer'with his back to EDUARDO, focused on his work. And then we see-SEAN step into the frame and lean against a desk a few yards away. And then back to EDUARDO, who's almost shaking... \n[292]What is this? \n[293]What is this? \n[294]Mark? MARK doesn't look up from his computer-- \n[295]Mark. MARK still doesn't look up-- \n[296]I'm sorry? \n[297]Is he? \n[298]How much were your shares diluted? How much were his?! \n[299]It wa \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \n[300]It wasn't. \n[301]It wasn't. \n[302]It wasn't. \n[303]Point-zero-three percent. \n[304]You set me up. 1. 49. \n[305]It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook. \n[306]My name's on the masthead. \n[307]This is because I froze the account? \n[308]Sorry, but my Prada's at the cleaners along with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip- flops you pretentious douchebag. \n[309]:I'm not signing those papers. \n[310]Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix. \n[311]You did it. I always knew you did it. You planted the story about the chicken. \n[312]You had me accused of animal cruelty. \n[313]And I'll bet you just hated that they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook- -which I am! You better lawyer-up, asshole, 'cause I'm not comin' for my 30 percent, I'm comin' after everythin g \n[314]I'm going. \n[315]I like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look tough in comparison. EDUARDO exits with the security escort. There's a long silence in the room... 151.

She can't hear him in the shower. SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a computer. He sees her \"friends\". Friend after friend after friend. \n[28]Jesus. He gets up and goes to the bathroom door-- \n[29]Amy? \n[30]Can'you come out here? \n[31]There's a fire, Amy. \n[32]Okay, there isn't a fire, but I need to ask you something. \n[33]No. \n[34]I3ow? \n[35]I went to check my e-mail and there's a website open on your computer. \n[36]What's that? \n[37]You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a pen? \n[38]Absolutely nothing.

And Mark, its great to meet you. \n[43]You guys don't have anything in front of you. \n[44].Cori. \n[45]Could you bring out some things? The lacquered pork with that ginger confit? I don't know, tuna tartar, some lobster claws, the foie gras and the shrimp dumplings, that'll get us started. Jenny, what do you like to drink? \n[46]Great. Four. \n[47]. tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties and in the end we just had to declare bankruptcy but I made a name for myself. ].02. \n[48]See, we had a VC from the beginning. Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from \n[49]In court. \n[50]Well. \n[51]Tell me about your progress. \n[52]\n[53]Perfect. \n[54]Neither of you. TheFacebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it. \n[55]You don't want to ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool. \n[56]it's like you're throwing the coolest party on campus and someone's telling you it's gotta be over at 11:00. \n[57]You don't even know what the thing is y\u00e2\u0082\u00act. 104, \n[58]Row big it can get and how far it can go. Picture sharing, news feeds, a virtual champagne room, apps you haven't even thought of. This.is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? \n[59]A billion dollars. And that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation. Unless you take bad advice in which case you might as well have come up with a chain of very successful dry cleaners. When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish. You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout? No, he's holding an. 800 pound marlin and that's what you want. Hey guys, it's your company, I don't have a dog in this fight. Irjust came to say hi. \n[60]Oh Hey. Drop the \"the\". Just Facebook, It's cleaner. And SEAN heads out, patting backs and kissing waitresses along the way. \n[61]Mark? \n[62]Do you live here? 118. \n[63]We were right across the street, we saw the chimney come-- \n[64]Is anybody hurt? \n[65]This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney-- \n[66]You came to California. \n[67]You made the right choice. \n[68]This house is great. The team is great. It's exactly what it should be. I'm Sean Parker. MARK comes out of the kitchen-- \n[69]That's what I'm talkin' about. Where's Eduardo? \n[70]Eduardo didn't come out? \n[71]That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I was crashing there for a little. bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place and I'm homeless. \n[72]That's sol..id man, thanks, \n[73]You got it. \n[74]She looks familiar to a lot of people. \n[75]Look at any Victoria's Secret catalogue from the last six months. \n[76]No man. I'll tell you something, you know how I founded Napster? \n[77]Fuck Wikipedia, Mark, no you don't. I was going out with this girl in high school. And it was great. I thought it was great, but the whole time--almost the .whole time we were together., like five months--she was giving blow. jobs to the co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I found out and I was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him. So I had this dream that I would make a billion dollar company.. Not a million dollar company--any hack can do that---a billion dollar company. And I would have business cards printed up that said, \"I'm CEO.. .Bitch. \" It's our time. We run the universe. Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model. I want to know where the fuck Eduardo is. \n[78]An internship? \n[79]The company's here. A billion dollar company is here. And what confuses me is that in New York, Eduardo introduced himself as the business head of Facebook. I've been at the front of two of the biggest things in the history of the internet and I can tell you that nothing, nothing is more important to a start-up than the energy and ambition of its founders. 122. \n[80]You have to live and breathe the project every minute of every day and-night. Do you live and breathe Facebook? \n[81]I know you do. I know those guys back at the house do. The guy's eyes did not blink when a beer bottle smashed into a fireplace 10 feet from his work, station. So I'll ask again--where's Eduar \n[82]I think I should. The girls come back-- \n[83]What's your goal for the summer? \n[84]Let's line up some shots.  Don Julio 1942. 123. \n[85]Mark? \n[86]But check it out, I saw him today. 129, \n[87]Moritz, Michael Moritz, my Sequoia Capital---hang on.  Are you guys using Wallhacks or Aimbots? \n[88]Use Barr cks. \n[89]I saw him getting into his car and he saw me too, I know he did. A Porsche Carrera 911 Turbo. Hang on. SEAN leans over one of the girls, casually hits a few keys and easily kills several of the other girl's soldiers. \n[90]You don't hear anything, you're supposed to be writing code. \n[91]The guy hires a P.T, to follow me around. Who does that in real life? Michael Moritz and I are gonna meet in a dark alley, I'll take Sequoia Capital down with him. SEAN opens the door and the soaking wet EDUARDO is standing there... \n[92]I'll call you back What's up? \n[93]He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he took a nap for a couple of hours. EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage-- \n[94]Not happened--happening. The next big thing. \n[95]Back to work. The girl at the bottom of the stairs has filled the bowl and lights a lighter-- \n[96]It's not polite to ask, \n[97]You think you know me, don't you. \n[98]You know how much I've read about you? Nothing. MARK comes down the stairs-- \n[99]Forget the wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up with Peter Thiel. You know Peter Thiel? \n[100]Why would you? He just runs a two-billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital and was the money behind PayPal. \n[101]How's the business end going? I see you got some big ticket ad buys lined up. \n[102]The Harvard Eartendi.ng Course, the Seneca Club's Red Party and the Mather House annual \"Lather Dance\". You're just one small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it. \n[103]Bong hit! \n[104]Don't worry about it, it's just from the pot. EDUARDO's followed MARK into-- \n[105]You know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno. \n[106]Oh yes. You're 20 minutes late. You're going to walk in there and say you overslept. and you didn't have time to get dressed, They're gonna pitch you, Sequoia Capital is gonna pitch you. They're gonna .tell you why you should take their money. They're gonna beg you to take their money, You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're. gonna nod and then you're -gonna say, \"Which one of you is Michael Moritz?\". Moritz is gonna say, \"That's me\". And you're gonna say, \"Sean Parker says 'Fuck you.' And walk right on out. \n[107]Fuck. You. \n[108]He's wired in. \n[109]He's wired in. \n[110]Yes. EDUARDO picks up MARK's laptop over his head and smashes it down on the desk, breaking it into pieces. \n[111]\n[112]It's not. gonna be like you're not part of Facebook, you're not part of Facebook. \n[113]Check again. EDUARDO is momentarily frozen... \n[114]You think we were gonna let you parade around in your ridiculous suits pretending you were running this company? \n[115]Oooh, security is here. You'll be leaving now. Two SECURITY GUARDS have come in-- \n[116]We'll get your signature. \n[117]What the fuck is he talking about? I didn't. \n[118]Seriously, what the fuck is up with the chicken? \n[119]Get him outa here. \n[120]Hang on. SEAN hands EDUARDO a\u00e2\u0080\u00a2folded check. \n[121]There's your $19,000. 1 wouldn't cash it, though, I drew it on the account you froze. EDUARDO looks. at SEAN. . .then suddenly and quickly cocks his fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDUARDO holds his punch and lets out a small laugh. \n[122]That's it. That's our show for tonight. I want to see everybody here get geared up for a party. We're gonna walk down to the club like it's the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. Mackey, put it up on the screen, we've gotta be almost there. A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read- out of the number of members. 999,982 There's scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches. SEAN takes MARK aside. \n[123]You alright? \n[124]That's life in the NFL. \n[125]Listen, I'm putting together a party-.- \n[126]I get it. I'll send flowers. I'm putting -together a party after the party at Gamma Phi Beta. Ashleigh over there's a sister and she says her friends are all down.. \n[127]Yeah. \n[128]Oh dude. \n[129]Yeah. An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along With a small package-- \n[130]She's 19, I can't he.lp it, But I'll tell you what--after tonight.she's yours. in fact, I'm. gonna get' you in with all sorts of girls you wouldn't have met before. Mackey! \n[131]Refresh! \n[132]The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously. 154, \n[133]I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on. \n[134]flow they always checked their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...We lived on farms, then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet. \n[135]It's the cops. And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm of his hand to get the coke dust off. \n[136]\n[137]We're sorry, was the music too loud? We've got kind of a celebration going. \n[138]I can have them turn the music down. One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The cop uses his finger to taste what it is. \n[139]Yeah, that isn't mine. \n[140]No sir. \n[141]I don It. \n[142]It's an Epipen, \n[143]That's my inhaler. \n[144]Listen, something's happened. We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of the conversation. \n[145]It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything. I mean, I've got allergies so I can't---- We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens... \n[146]I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think it was Michael Moritz. \n[147]I know. \n[148]It's cool, I've got it under control. 158, \n[149]You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have me followed?

You go online, you get to see what courses your friends are taking? \n[25]Well we've been working for a while on an idea. It's called HarvardConnecti.on. You create your own page, Picture, bio, interests, friends. \n[26]Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail address in the country. \n[27]We want you to be an equal partner. Our first programmer graduated and went to work at Google. Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with school work. We want you to write the code and build the site and we'll provide--- \n[28]--the money. What? \n[29]Tell him okay but we've gotta make sure we meet before we all head off for break. \n[30]what in the hell is this? \n[31]\"I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run.\" \n[32]Not now, we've got another 5000 meters. \n[33]I'm looking at the article in the Crimson. \n[34]Today's. \n[35]It's titled, \"Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website\" and then the sub- headline is \"Facemash creator seeks new reputation with latest online project.\" \n[36]No it's today's paper, it went online yesterday morning around 10. \n[37]Mr. Hotchkiss. \n[38]Ty, the lawyer's on the phone with dad. I'm here with my brother, Tyler, and our partner, Divya. \n[39]That's right. 59. \n[40]Yes sir, he's quoted a couple of times. I can read--it says, \"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal .facebook within 1 arvard', he says\"--he meaning Mark--\"I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a coupl-e-af years to get around to it. I can do \u00c2\u00b1 better than they can and I did in a week.\" \n[41]I know, that's how he talks. \n[42]Yeah, Divya was just reading that he'd signed up 650 people on the first day. \n[43]Guys, please, for just one second. That's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss. We're gonna put it all, together right now and e-mail it to you. You won't be able to get on the site yourself.  60. \n[44]Because you went to Ohio State.

Thank you very much, and dad, we'll talk to you in the morning too. Thanks.

This is Harvard. You don't plant stories and you don't sue people. That's why. There's a right way to do things. \n[63]\n[64]I want those things too! \n[65]Because you're not thinking about how it's going to look. \n[66]Like my brother and I are dressed in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym. \n[67]There's no such thing as Harvard Law. \n[68]--you can't steal from another student.

I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler. CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it, SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten- page letter off the top. \n[74]I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the letter. \n[75]Well I think it's pretty self- explanatory. We had an idea for a website called HarvardConnection--we've since changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and-- \n[76]--it says, \"The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community. All students are required to respect private and public ownership. Instances of theft, misappropriation or unauthorized use of or damage to property \n[77]--will result in disciplinary action, including the requirement to withdraw from the College.\" That's what is says in the handbook. \n[78]Yes sir, and the R.A. made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't hear us. \n[79]Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of our e-mails or phone calls for. the last' two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to talking face to face is when I saw him on. the quad and chased him through Harvard Square. \n[80]I saw him and I know he saw me and I started after him and he disappeared \n[81]What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer it would be a university issue, right? \n[82]\n[83]Yes. \n[84]I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir. \n[85]You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand-the, difference between right and wrong. \n[86]Of course I'm not saying that. \n[87]Ty. Thank you for your time, sir. We appreciate your seeing us. \n[88]Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we \n[89]Yeah. We didn't want it enough. That was the problem. Fuck you, you fucking little-- \n[90]I'm sorry, dad. You and mom flew all the way over. \n[91]Let's fucking gut that little nerd.

TYLER picks up a copy-of the Crimson and begins reading while his brother and DIVYA keep talking. \n[4]He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female Harvard undergrads. What were we doing that none of us heard about this? \n[5]I'm way ahead of you. \n[6]H i.. MARK is stealing a glance around the room... \n[7]We were really impressed with Facemash and then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch. MARK is looking at the framed black and white group pictures on the wall. of old Porcellian classes. He sees a pretty co-ed on the couch with her legs stretched over her boyfriend while they study. \n[8]Mark? \n[9]And you invented something in high school. \n[10]Anybody try to buy it? \n[11]How much did they pay? \n[12]\n[13]MARK gives a short shrug that says both \"I don't know\" and \"Fuck you\" at the same time. 3n, \n[14]\"I'm also really busy tomorrow.\" Anybody else feel like there's something up with this guy? \n[15]\"I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon.\" \n[16]\"Won't be able to do it Saturday as I have to meet up with my parents to..\" \n[17]Yes it was. \n[18]He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead on--- \n[19]You used our whole fuckin' idea! \n[20]I'm just gonna stand over your shoulder while you write is a check. \n[21]Seven different people spammed me the same link. We see DIVYA click his mouse on the link-- \n[22]I don't know, but I'm really hoping it's video of kittens that look like the Marx Brothers 'cause I can never get enough file footage on my computer of animals doing... DIVYA trails off. We Slowly PUSH IN on his face as the blood starts draining away... \n[23]I--uh...I have to go. DIVYA shuts his laptop, grabs it off the table and starts to bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a chair leg and he falls hard face-first to the floor. \n[24]Shit. He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it; starts out and falls down all over again. Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we \n[25]Hey! The twins are in the zone and don't pay any attention. \n[26]Hey ! \n[27]Okay. I just wanted to let you know Zuckerberg stole our website. TYLER stops rowing and then CAMERON. They look at DIVYA... \n[28]Mark Zuckerberg stole our website. It's been live for over 36 hours. \n[29]I left a message with his R.A., I left two, now I'm leaving one here. \n[30]Narendra. \n[31]N-A---just tell him Divya, he knows who I am. (clicks off phone and starts to dial another number Asshole knows who I am. \n[32]It's me again. Can you try looking for his roommates? Their names are Chris Hughes and Dustin Moskowitz. \n[33]I don't have the slightest idea. \n[34]Thank you. \n[35]I called earlier. I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg. \n[36]Could you leave word that Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it. \n[37]\n[38]And this kid doesn't have four friends. \n[39]Whoa !. ; \n[40]This is a good guy? \n[41]We know that he took our idea and stole it. We know that-he lied to. our faces for a month and a half-while he-- \n[42]He never saw our. faces! Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts and he got himself a 42-day head start because he knows what apparently you don't which is that getting there first is everythinal \n[43]Alright. That was your father's lawyer on the phone with you? \n[44]A cease and desist letter doesn't have any teeth. \n[45]I think we should hire lawyers and have them beat him senseless with a crescent wrench. \n[46]Just how much more information are you waiting for? We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code, he'd seen what Victor had already done and we talked at length about what we planned to do. The page looks the same: What is that on the bottom? \n[47]On the home page? \n[48]Hang on, 'cause I need a minute to let the classiness waft over me. \n[49]Why not?

Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?! \n[62]How's it going to look? \n[63]He violated Massachusetts state law. Then when he goes to Connecticut, New York and California he'll have violated federal law.

Okay? I was asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code. \n[25]You're obsessed with the finals clubs.

As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published. The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch. Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, published my bra size and then rated women-based on their hotness. Why don't you say it to me now, why don't say it to my face? \n[61]No, there's no problem. You're not a real person, Mark. You write your bullshit from a dark room because you're a failure at human contact.
