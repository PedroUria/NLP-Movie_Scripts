Listen, fire up the grill 'cause the Bassmasters are headed home! \n[9]Yes, be gone with the red meat! \n[10]\n[11]I think so. \n[12]Oh my God, dad -- \n[13]I can't -- It won't give -- \n[14]Dad, here -- \n[15]Dad, please, you can do it -- \n[16]No -- I'm not leaving -- \n[17]NO -- Dad, please, I've got you -- \n[18]Este invierno -- \n[19]Este verano -- voy a -- \n[20]I don't know, alright?    I haven't gotten that far. \n[21]Guess not. \n[22]The execution squad shows up? \n[23]Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game -- \n[24]Hobby, Jet, you guys still there? \n[25]I got nothin'. \n[26]What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD? \n[27]Freakin' irritated ankle disorder. \n[28]C'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar -- \n[29]News. \n[30]And your point is? \n[31]You canceled my Xbox subscription. \n[32]That might be difficult. \n[33]That's a little dramatic, isn't it? I'm just gonna plug it back -- \n[34]What are you, mental? \n[35]Yes! \n[36]Dammit, Ronnie, I'm losing my mind. \n[37]Give me some details, what's happening out there? \n[38]Wait, Ronnie -- Hello? \n[39]\n[40]I'm coming!! \n[41]Oh shit!   Shit water shit! \n[42]You think that's funny? \n[43]Not before I shove this shit up your ass! \n[44]Shit! \n[45]Turn green turn green turn green... \n[46]No, c'mon, I'm way inside, turn green -- \n[47]Yes!   That's what I'm talking about! \n[48]It's cool, I'm all green. \n[49]Okay, fine, but if I'd known -- \n[50]Hey doggie, come here... \n[51]Hey, you and me both. \n[52]I've got something to show you, too. I mean... there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough... \n[53]The world right outside the window. \n[54]Just wait... and... Three... two... one... dog... \n[55]...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie... \n[56]Maid. \n[57]Four o'clock every Thursday, she goes to the country club to play tennis with Betty Big-Bangs there. \n[58]And... ladies disappear... cue white Mercedes... Mr. Pilch... arriving from the office... \n[59]Will you just look -- \n[60]He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math. \n[61]Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject. \n[62]Now tilt your gaze up... \n[63]C'mon, there's more. \n[64]No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom. \n[65]So... Robert Giles... \n[66]He's lived there a couple of years, but I've never noticed he mows his lawn every two days. \n[67]Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up. \n[68]Last stop on the tour. \n[69]Don't know. \n[70]Nope, no I'm fine. \n[71]Thanks, that was really humiliating. \n[72]Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way. \n[73]Hey, so -- how'd the move go? \n[74]I'd help, but... I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment. \n[75]But minus the 48-hour allowance for office visits. And no lame \"Apprentice\" spin-off. So where'd you move from? \n[76]That doesn't sound good. \n[77]Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger. Nice talking to you. \n[78]I know the tone. \n[79]Noticed that, too. \n[80]You started without me? \n[81]What are you stopping for? \n[82]No -- \n[83]Whoa. \n[84]-- Mustang -- \n[85]Holy shit.   A dent -- \n[86]What?   No, I -- \n[87]Nothing, just watching the wind blow. \n[88]No, see for yourself. \n[89]'65 or '66, couldn't tell. \n[90]Movement. \n[91]Better late than never. \n[92]That's definitely new. \n[93]Jackass! \n[94]Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that. \n[95]I think she saw me -- \n[96]Seriously? \n[97]No, she usually takes her time -- \n[98]It's not gonna be her. \n[99]I have to. \n[100]It's her. \n[101]She totally saw us -- \n[102]Dude, she knows I'm here. \n[103]Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs -- \n[104]So... what brings you here. \n[105]Do you need to call anyone? \n[106]Uh, sure, come on in -- \n[107]That's Ronnie. \n[108]Excuse me... \n[109]It's a little messy. \n[110]So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? \n[111]He drives a car like the one she was seen in. \n[112]60's era Mustang. \n[113]They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender. \n[114]Hey -- \n[115]Yeah -- \n[116]What? \n[117]How'd he fix it so fast -- \n[118]You serious? She's right. \n[119]They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago. \n[120]About two or three years. \n[121]Not that I've seen -- \n[122]He's been gone awhile. \n[123]How'd you get my phone? \n[124]What'd you do? \n[125]What the hell? \n[126]Where's -- \n[127]So that's why the grass is greener... \n[128]So why the move? \n[129]No, seriously. \n[130]What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape? \n[131]That's him. \n[132]No. \n[133]How do you know? \n[134]Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though... Your I.D. must be pretty good. \n[135]He's going in. \n[136]What do you think they're listening to? \n[137]And she's down for the count. \n[138]Looks like. \n[139]What were you expecting? \n[140]Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me to. \n[141]\"Fine?\" \n[142]\"Fine\" like your first cousin \"fine\" or \"fine\" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way? \n[143]I can't hear -- \n[144]I can't -- \n[145]Ashley, come on... \n[146]Are you nuts?! \n[147]Mom? \n[148]Dammit. \n[149]Shit! \n[150]Dumbass dumbass -- \n[151]Okay, so where is she -- \n[152]Oh shit oh shit... \n[153]Ronnie -- \n[154]Giles totally busted me. \n[155]They were arguing -- \n[156]Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her -- \n[157]And then -- nothing. \n[158]Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too? \n[159]Wait -- \n[160]A door just slammed. \n[161]Asshole, I'm serious. \n[162]Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall -- \n[163]Goddamn you!! \n[164]No, don't! \n[165]Ronnie -- just Ronnie. \n[166]I heard the door -- \n[167]Fine.   Good.     Okay -- \n[168]Anything caffeinated. \n[169]I know, how did you -- \n[170]Dad put those security bolts on -- \n[171]Gee, really lucky you were there. \n[172]Yeah, I do. \n[173]That's right. \n[174]I think I'd like to hear his opinion. \n[175]I popped my Spanish teacher. \n[176]I like your shirt, by the way.    I mean, the color. \n[177]Oh, the... that dark orange.   Always reminds me of Texas. \n[178]Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas -- \n[179]Huh. \n[180]Just a black eye. \n[181]I know, he's a total freak, right? \n[182]Are you messing with me? \n[183]So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- \n[184]The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- \n[185]Maybe. \n[186]Her car hasn't moved. \n[187]Well what if she's really \"not moving?\" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- \n[188]You're leaving? \n[189]Whose? \n[190]How is that possible? \n[191]Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- \n[192]Oh my god, \"Skinny Psycho?!\" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish -- \n[193]And now the whole neighborhood's coming. \n[194]Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain. \n[195]Well, I appreciate the thought. Really. \n[196]It's funny, though. \n[197]I didn't peg you as a conformist. \n[198]Yeah, I'm calling about the Jeep Cherokee that was brought in with the flat and the stripped lug -- it's ready? Listen, did they have to replace the whole tire -- they patched it? Is there any way to tell if it was slashed or -- But a nail usually acts like its own plug for awhile, doesn't it? I mean it's a really slow leak, it can't flatten a tire in twenty minutes. -- Yeah, I guess anything's possible. \n[199]Wait, what was that? You think I'm watching? Well, I'm not... Nope, I am minding my own business... \n[200]You think I'm buying that? \n[201]I'm not biting -- \n[202]That's it. \n[203]Hey! \n[204]Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life. \n[205]Okay -- okay -- \n[206]What are you doing? \n[207]Coulda fooled me. \n[208]Forget -- \n[209]You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me. \n[210]It's not a cover -- \n[211]What else have I seen? \n[212]Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it. \n[213]But I've also seen those designer window shades of yours, and guess what? They always go up the next day -- no matter what. And even if no one else has, I've noticed that. And I ain't sorry. The only thing I'll even consider apologizing for is... not dropping the binoculars and telling you this a lot sooner. \n[214]Hey. \n[215]If would have gone to the flower shop, but -- \n[216]Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take. \n[217]You know the other night... when you said you thought I'd be more messed up... \n[218]I didn't kill my -- \n[219]Three-thirty. \n[220]You better see this. \n[221]Look, quick -- \n[222]Her car... still hasn't moved... \n[223]Phase one, steal his code from his opener. \n[224]There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. \"On\" or \"off.\" \n[225]No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag -- \n[226]This is good up to thirteen digits -- \n[227]Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time... \n[228]Yo, you set? \n[229]Let me conference Ashley in. Ashley, you there? \n[230]Nice. \n[231]Okay, Ron -- Green light. \n[232]You're all good. \n[233]You okay -- \n[234]Dude, glove compartment, other side. \n[235]Well, while you're there, will you just check? \n[236]You see the package? \n[237]Whenever you're ready. \n[238]Just start over. \n[239]No, no -- \n[240]Ronnie, he's coming around. \n[241]Ronnie, I am not dicking with you. The neighbor is also mowing her lawn and he's going to see you -- \n[242]\n[243]Put the remote back -- \n[244]Easy on the door. \n[245]Don't panic, he's coming straight for you -- \n[246]Back seat, NOW! \n[247]Shut up, stay down and don't move. \n[248]Ronnie, you're good -- \n[249]Ronnie? \n[250]Ronnie, was that the whole code? Ronnie? \n[251]even though she can't hear \n[252]Was that the whole code? \n[253]The code, did you get it? \n[254]No way. \n[255]Getting her license number -- \n[256]\"Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me.\" That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people -- \n[257]Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just... what's in the bag? Can anyone tell me that? \n[258]Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture -- \n[259]Trying to get to the bottom of this. \n[260]What's it look like? \n[261]Not who I think. \n[262]What, crazy?     Maybe I am.   But maybe I'm right. \n[263]Are you two gonna help me or not? \n[264]Then start looking through these -- \n[265]Well, this is all I need, so -- I guess I'll see you later. \n[266]So what's your deal? You hanging out or not? \n[267]Sure. \n[268]Get off me, man. \n[269]Ronnie, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but... listen, I'll help you get it, I just need you to do one thing. \n[270]You read? \n[271]Got video, no audio. \n[272]Light on, far end. \n[273]No movement. \n[274]Stay calm, it's there. \n[275]You're still clear, check the bag. \n[276]Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents -- \n[277]The camera's sliding -- \n[278]Ronnie? \n[279]Ronnie?! \n[280]He's in the house -- Ronnie? \n[281]What the hell -- \n[282]RONNIE!    Shit -- \n[283]Ronnie?! \n[284]Ronnie, can you hear me?! Giles, open the door!! \n[285]Hey! \n[286]Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him -- \n[287]It was already open. \n[288]You're a lying son of a bitch! \n[289]He's in there, goddammit!   He's inside! He's lying! \n[290]Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this -- That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago -- \n[291]So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood -- \n[292]So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?! \n[293]Mom -- \n[294]It was -- \n[295]Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me -- \n[296]\n[297]Shit -- \n[298]Ronnie -- \n[299]How -- How long have you been here? \n[300]Still, you could have -- \n[301]I get it. \n[302]Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right? \n[303]What if he wasn't always a guy? \n[304]Dead deer. \n[305]I was watching, remember? \n[306]So that's when the garage door started closing. \n[307]That's great. \n[308]Yeah, I lost signal -- \n[309]I'm gonna burn this. \n[310]You're not fooling me, Giles... \n[311]Ronnie, get your ass up here! \n[312]Ronnie?! \n[313]Ronnie -- MOM!! \n[314]It's dead. \n[315]Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen -- \n[316]No, I've gotta get her -- \n[317]Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff -- \n[318]Once I have his attention, you go get her. \n[319]We're out here, asshole! \n[320]Ashley!   Are you okay? \n[321]Stick to the plan -- \n[322]That was a warning! \n[323]Where's my mom? \n[324]I don't know -- the cops should be here any sec -- \n[325]No flashing lights -- stay here -- \n[326]Parker, where's the cavalry?! \n[327]Parker, you need to get them here right now -- Giles is -- \n[328]\n[329]He was my best friend. We always talked about what guys talk about... sports, women... food... We were talking about the freakin' fish -- this huge, amazing black bass we'd just caught -- and how we'd be eating it for a week... the next thing I know -- I can't hold on... and he's letting go... I was so pissed at \n[330]him, I was so -- he's the one who left, he's the one who gave up, you know? -- But that's b.s. See, the truth is, my dad -- He saved me. \n[331]Movement. \n[332]She's whacked. Plain and simple. I think she thought it'd be some sick challenge or something -- hey, commission's the same I guess... \n[333]No way.   She can't be serious. \n[334]Fine, but we still have to seriously question the yayhoos buying the place. \n[335]Screw that. My mom has another half hour over there at least. ", "ASHLEY": "\n[1]enters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them in her dresser, then -- she pulls her hair back, yanks off her t-shirt, revealing a black bra. ON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra and disappears into the bathroom. Off Kale -- \n[2]pulls the car into and up the drive.    She glances at Kale who nods and smiles back. As the stationwagon heads up the driveway, Kale tries to push himself upright -- but his feet SLIP. He pitches forward more. He glances back over his shoulder, sees Ashley getting out of the car and looking his way. Kale struggles under his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward him. A slight smile crosses Kale's face as -- \n[3]Can I help you? \n[4]Too late. \n[5]Please. I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago. \n[6]Still going. \n[7]Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on -- \n[8]I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and now... Forcefully relocated. \n[9]I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal. \n[10]Wait, I -- \n[11]My mom -- she's very polite, always says \"please\" but she's got that tone, did you notice? \n[12]Oh, I'm Ashley -- \n[13]What took you so long? The house isn't that big. \n[14]Oh.   -- Locked out. \n[15]Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind. \n[16]May I? \n[17]Nice to meet you. Video games, huh? I like to play. \n[18]A little? \n[19]Anything interesting out there? \n[20]Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale? \n[21]Is that so. \n[22]Yeah, I've seen him.   So? \n[23]What, you think he -- \n[24]Gee, that really narrows it down. \n[25]So this is why -- you're -- \n[26]So that's the infamous black mustang, huh? \n[27]The one with no dent? \n[28]Because it was never there in the first place? \n[29]Sorry guys, no bashed-in fender, just a Longhorns bumper sticker. \n[30]Okay, fine, stakeout. Who's on my shift? \n[31]Do you know how long Giles has lived there? \n[32]So he could've lived in Texas... Hey, check this out. \n[33]The summary lists four main criteria. Our guy meets at least three. White male between the age of twenty-five and fifty. He doesn't have any pets, right? \n[34]You said he lives alone -- \n[35]Sexual dysfunction. \n[36]I'm hungry, let's order pizza. \n[37]Here. \n[38]I'm crafty like that. \n[39]Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear. \n[40]Three to one he doesn't pick it up. \n[41]Only in disturbia... \n[42]What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures... \n[43]Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life... had its temptations... But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever. \n[44]Something like that. So... what're your issues, Kale? \n[45]Another car -- \n[46]You seen her before? \n[47]Cute for a killer. \n[48]Who said chivalry's dead? \n[49]There's a club girl for you. \n[50]Bright green bracelet's \"The Pyramids,\" purple's \"Club 360,\" the big black stamp's from \"Flavor.\" \n[51]I don't need one. \n[52]Denied... \n[53]Oh no, he put on music... \n[54]Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance. \n[55]Could be radio. See if you can find the station. \n[56]No... no... \n[57]Stop. \n[58]Now's the time to bust your move. \n[59]It's my mom. Hi. No, I'm fine. I'm at Barnes and Noble.    Okay, I'm leaving. No, I'll walk. \n[60]Looks like this is as far as you go. \n[61]Y'know, I have to admit, you're different than I expected. \n[62]I thought you'd be more messed up. \n[63]No, you're fine. \n[64]Yeah. \n[65]He wants her to come back in -- \n[66]Let's get closer -- \n[67]That was intense. \n[68]Oooh. That's creepy. \n[69]And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a \"sinister message?\" \n[70]Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair? \n[71]With the non dent dent -- \n[72]Why, because he slashed your mom's tire? \n[73]It's called \"the day after,\" Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that. \n[74]Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me. \n[75]Have to.    Party. \n[76]Uh, mine? \n[77]Excuse me? \n[78]I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco? \n[79]I told her my parents were outta town -- \n[80]Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it. \n[81]Kale, you're welcome to come, but -- \n[82]Glad to hear it. \n[83]What? \n[84]Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya? \n[85]storming in from the kitchen and marching up the stairs! \n[86]as if shocked by something \n[87]Back off or I'll throw it where you can't follow. \n[88]Even better. \n[89]What are you doing? \n[90]I'm trying to enjoy my party. Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform -- \n[91]What does that mean? \n[92]No, I'm not gonna forget it. \n[93]So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight?    Or maybe a week? Two weeks? Since I moved in? \n[94]And the whole \"my-neighbor's-the- killer\" thing. Great cover -- \n[95]So what is it, Kale?   Huh?   What else have you seen? \n[96]Yeah.

What Ronnie and I are seeing right now. I see a guy who looks like he hasn't slept in days. I'm seeing you sitting at your dad's desk -- \n[123]-- Because you lost him before maybe... you ever really knew him.

But it's like -- it's like you're still trying to dodge them by forcing pieces together that are never gonna fit... by getting all wrapped up in... This. Obsessing's not gonna \"protect you,\" Kale.

Can we just... hug it out? \n[112]You know, let's be positive for a change. I thought he did, but maybe he didn't.

Hey, you want more evidence, detective? \n[115]No, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment. \n[116]Hey, I caught that. \n[117]Yeah, he must have heard me. He came through the inside door -- This is where I ducked low and started... \n[118]...hauling aaaass... \n[119]Dropped it. \n[120]But I never leave evidence behind. \n[121]And that's about when you started yelling bloody murder and the shit hit the fan. \n[122]I'm starving.

You want anything from the grocery? I'm going in the morning. \n[26]Oh. Kale, I ran into Mr. Giles at -- \n[27]...At the grocery. I had a flat tire when I came out. We tried to change it, but -- \n[28]And that adapter thingy that unscrews it ended up stripping it instead -- \n[29]No, it wasn't. You saved my life. We had it towed to Frank's. \n[30]Oh... no, it's okay, we're managing. \n[31]Oh c'mon, Kale. I'm sorry. \n[32]Okay... I don't think that's the case, and -- \n[33]Wait, what about your coffee? \n[34]Shoot, milk's... still in the car. \n[35]Kale, could you grab the sugar? Sugar? \n[36]Kale, come on -- \n[37]I'm sorry, Kale. \n[38]I really am. You know, one thing I always told myself was that no matter what, I would always know what was going on with my kid -- \n[39]Let me finish -- because I have to tell you something... I feel like I let you down. I was too caught up in my own grief to see straight. I thought time would heal this and taking a second job was... the answer to keeping a roof over our heads -- \n[40]That's just wood. Do you hear me? We're still not through this -- obviously -- it's gonna take more time -- maybe a lot more time -- and that's just gotta be okay, because I know -- it'll get better. I want us to be us again. I want us to be honest with each other like we used to be. Is that possible? \n[41]Listen to me. I am always on your side. No matter what. It may not look like it sometimes, but it's the truth.

Robert Giles, your neighbor -- Behind you? \n[7]Think I startled him. \n[8]Robert... \n[9]My fault. \n[10]Just glad I could help. Must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house. \n[11]I've always been curious about those things, do you mind? \n[12]No, no.   It's none of my business. \n[13]Whoa, hey, dude... you seem like a straight hitter. You ask me, whoever they are deserved it. \n[14]And I think I opened my big mouth again. You're absolutely right. I should go. \n[15]In that case, cafe con leche, por favor? \n[16]Which one? \n[17]Yeah?   You a Longhorns fan, too? \n[18]Me neither. Had a lot of friends who went there.

Wonder if your dad thought that. See with me, it's the opposite. The very first one was... ...Very difficult... she was very beautiful... fragile... a lot of promise... the others in Texas were flings, low class... Patty Walsh had potential, but so did Amy. You saw her, right? When you were watching me? You should feel good, Kale, you guys saved her life. I was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale.
