{"dialogues": {"Z": "\n[1]All my life, I've lived and worked in the big city... \n[2]...which is kind of a problem, since I've always felt uncomfortably in crowds. \n[3]I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub.  The whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant. \n[4]...I should? \n[5]Why are we so successful? \n[6]...Ants... \n[7]But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love. \n[8]Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop! Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene? Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's two million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after? \n[9]The squeaky wheel gets the oil. \n[10]Thank goodness.  Breaktime. \n[11]This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing? \n[12]We declared war again? Are you scared? \n[13]Did you see that?  How he gave you the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers. \n[14]Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them. \n[15]Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me. \n[16]I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy. \n[17]Of course.  You were born two seconds after me. \n[18]Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid. \n[19]Hey, Weaver, listen! \n[20]Hey, did you hear what he said?! \n[21]I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders. \n[22]What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- \n[23]Me?!  Yes!!!  I mean -- Just let me finish my beer. \n[24]So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before? \n[25]The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding -- \n[26]Now, let's see, I -- it's been a while since I -- I think you -- \n[27]Here, I'll lead. \n[28]Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- \n[29]Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow. \n[30]You -- you think I'm right? \n[31]Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble! You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- \n[32]Because -- because I'm an individual! \n[33]Princess?  You're a Princess? \n[34]Wait!  When can I see you again? \n[35]Wait!  Princess!  Wait! \n[36]Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign! \n[37]What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content! \n[38]You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you! \n[39]Well I'm gonna start doing things for you... \n[40]You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you! \n[41]You're a real buddy. \n[42]What do I do? \n[43]Thanks!  I owe you! \n[44]Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up?  She's kind of a personal friend. \n[45]\"Trapped inside your head\" -- that's a good one -- \n[46]Geez -- tough room. \n[47]Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore. \n[48]Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush. \n[49]Bravo!  Bring on the Princess! \n[50]Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's me!  Z!  I've got your scarf! \n[51]Excuse me, guys -- That's my date. Well, it's been fun.  Have a great war! \n[52]Hey!  Wait! \n[53]I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership! \n[54]Wait a minute, there's been a mistake!  I've got to get back to the colony! \n[55]Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition? \n[56]Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile! \n[57]So -- these termites, they're little, shy, retiring insects? \n[58]Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork? \n[59]So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?! \n[60]Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home. \n[61]Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over! \n[62]Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come out in spots!  -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species?  I mean, eating wood -- why didn't I think of that? \n[63]BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life! \n[64]Look out! \n[65]Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I was wondering if you could give me -- \n[66]I'll let myself out. \n[67]Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro! \n[68]Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake -- \n[69]This is terrific!   Let's exact crippling war reparations!  Let's set up a puppet government! \n[70]Barbatus? \n[71]Barbatus! \n[72]No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks. \n[73]Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere! \n[74]Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!! \n[75]It was horrible...a massacre, a massacre upon a massacre.  First we massacred them, then they massacred us, then it was halftime.  I've never seen such violence, such bloodthirstiness, such bad manners...I'm the only one that made it! \n[76]No -- you -- you don't understand! \n[77]Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there? \n[78]\n[79]Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform? \n[80]Engaged?  As in you're getting married? \n[81]So...you two are in love? \n[82]Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony. \n[83]...Not enough food? \n[84]Well I, I don't think \"living it up\" is the right term -- how about \"working themselves to death\"? \n[85]Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations. \n[86]But...don't you think the worker class is the very foundation of the colony -- I mean, uh, without them, who would we stand on? \n[87]Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am. \n[88]And you are...? \n[89]Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero? \n[90]Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter. \n[91]Just warming up... \n[92]Oh, of course -- \n[93]Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it -- \n[94]Divinely? \n[95]No...as a matter of fact... \n[96]Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you. \n[97]That's not what you said the other night -- \n[98]-- At the worker bar!  You were pretty hot to trot then! \n[99]Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse -- \n[100]Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore -- \n[101]No I'm not -- I mean -- nobody move! Or the Princess gets it! \n[102]Stay back, you lunatic!  Do you think I don't know how to use this? \n[103]Uh-oh. \n[104]You're telling me... \n[105]How should I know? \n[106]Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals. \n[107]Excuse me, I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects. \n[108]Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot? \n[109]Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it? \n[110]But can there be a society composed of just two ants? \n[111]Look around, sweetheart. \n[112]Well I guess that makes us even. \n[113]Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker! \n[114]Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica? \n[115]Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia. \n[116]Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg... That direction. \n[117]I've got a name.  It's Z. \n[118]Water...water -- oh, you already said that. \n[119]I ruined your life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable. \n[120]Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again? \n[121]Well I'll be. \n[122]Want a list? \n[123]It's...it's... \n[124]This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential! \n[125]Listen, \"Princess\", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just -- \n[126]Hlllllllp! \n[127]Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you? \n[128]Look.  How many other Princesses are there? \n[129]And only you can become a Queen? \n[130]So what makes you so special? \n[131]Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced. \n[132]...The land of red and white... \n[133]We've found it!  Insectopia!  Look at all this food' \n[134]Let's dig in! \n[135]There's - there's some kind of force field! \n[136]Hunh? \n[137]We're ants! \n[138]I sort of imagined Insectopia a little differently -- \n[139]Bala, look out!! \n[140]Bala! I'll never see her again... \n[141]These things always come in twos... \n[142]Take me to your leader! \n[143]Whoooooooaaaa!!! \n[144]Bala!  Come back here! \n[145]Aa-ee-ya-ee-yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!! \n[146]Yeah.  I'm here. \n[147]Yes? \n[148]We're safe... \n[149]Who the hell is that?!!! \n[150]Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. \"Insectopia\". \n[151]There's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders. \n[152]...Insectopia? \n[153]Yippeeeeee! \n[154]\n[155]Yeah, well, I make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead. \n[156]Charmed. \n[157]So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night? \n[158]Well, \"trouble\" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night. \n[159]Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else... \n[160]Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday. Well, to be honest, I just liked having it. \n[161]Sure.  I wasn't busy or anything. \n[162]Great timing, guys.  Ever wonder why they call you \"pests\"? \n[163]Oh, Bala?  I guess she's okay, you know, for a princess.  I mean, I usually date queens, or you know, empresses, because sometimes the lesser nobility are too much in awe of my smouldering sensuality.  Please stop me if I'm making you feel inadequate. \n[164]What's the matter?  This place is as cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out time. \n[165]She's been kidnapped?!  But I can't live without her! \n[166]I'm going back.  I've got to get her. Who'll come with me? \n[167]You?! \n[168]Let's go, pal! \n[169]Wow...I never saw things this way... \n[170]Things look so close together from up here...there's the desert...and the lake... it's not far from the colony at all... \n[171]Thanks, Chip. \n[172]How am I going to get in?  The place is crawling with soldiers! \n[173]Don't bite!  I surrender! \n[174]Well...if you insist... \n[175]Geez, this place really empties out in August.  Where is everybody? \n[176]You \"smell\" me?  Well look, I -- I've been out in the wilderness for a while, and -- \n[177]Hey, wait, you're...you're one of those pheremone sniffers, aren't you? Maybe you can help me...I'm looking for a friend of mine, Princess Bala. \n[178]Just remember, I met her first. \n[179]Bala's through there? \n[180]Great.  More digging.  This is why I left in the first place. \n[181]Bala! \n[182]Why do they have you tied up here? \n[183]Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it! -- Formica's going to flood the colony!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants! \n[184]I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've got to warn the others. \n[185]Head for the surface, Bala.  If I don't make it, well...we'll always have Insectopia. \n[186]Stoooooop! \n[187]Listen up!  We've all got to get out of here!  This place is going to flood! \n[188]You've got to believe me! \n[189]I'm Z. \n[190]I am Z! \n[191]Weaver! \n[192]Don't worry about it, pal. \n[193]To save you all!  Now we've got to go! \n[194]\n[195]Dig! \n[196]We've got to dig a trench around us! \n[197]Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now dig! \n[198]That's it!  Pass the dirt back to the center!  Go on! \n[199]Your highness...time to get your hands dirty! \n[200]We need to form a scaffolding around this mound -- let's DO IT! \n[201]Now climb! \n[202]Okay boys -- take her up! \n[203]Wait... \n[204]...I'm Z. \n[205]I thought you said that the life of one ant doesn't matter. \n[206]So, uh, that's pretty much it.  Just your basic \"simple worker overthrows the government and winds up with the princess\" kind of a story. You know: there was the big parade and everything... \n[207]General Formica was almost unemployable.  He eventually got a gig as a honeydew keg. \n[208]The Queen asked me to take over his job, but I said \"Sorry, but I'm really not the general type.  I'm more the specific type.\"  So they gave the job to Weaver instead. \n[209]Weaver cut the defense budget in half.  Now we only have an army of five million. \n[210]And me, I guess you could say that I lived happily ever after. \n[211]I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids. \n[212]Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you know?  I wouldn't change a thing. ", "BALA": "\n[1]General Formica! \n[2]Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another. \n[3]It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation? \n[4]General -- we have to talk sometime! \n[5]So, um...how was your day?  What did you do? \n[6]Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common... \n[7]You did? \n[8]Yes...he's wonderful... \n[9]Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom. Do I look fat to you? \n[10]The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different. \n[11]The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go! \n[12]I'm the Princess, aren't I? \n[13]And do Princesses do improper things? \n[14]Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. \n[15]I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day! \n[16]I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me! \n[17]I know. \n[18]Wanna dance? \n[19]I work in the palace, I don't get out much. \n[20]What? \n[21]Are you sure this is a real dance? \n[22]Really? \n[23]You're right! \n[24]Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! \n[25]You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! \n[26]Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself? \n[27]Uh oh. Goodbye!  Gotta run! \n[28]Let me think.  Hmmnn... Never.  Bye! \n[29]Who is that idiot? \n[30]You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you? \n[31]I'm Princess Bala. \n[32]Yes. \n[33]No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero. \n[34]You dance... \n[35]No weirdly...You remind me of someone... \n[36]He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual. \n[37]He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I? \n[38]\n[39]\n[40]Quiet -- sshhh!! \n[41]\n[42]I'm coming!  I'm coming! \n[43]I'm going!  I'm going' \n[44]What was that thing? \n[45]I order you to find out where we are! \n[46]Climb up that tree and get a better view! \n[47]I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. \n[48]How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! \n[49]Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! \n[50]No!  There's no such thing as \"just two ants.\"  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! \n[51]I -- hate -- you. \n[52]Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me! \n[53]I was slumming it!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place! \n[54]I didn't choose him.  What kind  of idiot would... ...choose who she wanted to marry? \n[55]Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole! \n[56]Insectopia?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale! \n[57]Worker!  Come back here now! \n[58]That's not a name!  That's just a letter! \n[59]Worker? Oh WORKER?  Where are you? Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!! \n[60]Water...water... \n[61]My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. \n[62]Look out! \n[63]We're going to die! \n[64]Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me? \n[65]Wait, I hear something! \n[66]\n[67]Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap. \n[68]Out here I'm just what? \n[69]Stop fooling around in there. \n[70]Let me go!!! \n[71]I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon. \n[72]General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee. \n[73]Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now. \n[74]Well...no, but -- \n[75]Well...I am the oldest. \n[76]By three seconds... \n[77]You're right.  There are as many Princesses...as there are blades of grass. \n[78]I swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times. \n[79]Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess... \n[80]What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire... \n[81]You were right...you were right! Z, it's beautiful! \n[82]Hello?  I'm not just \"any insect\". My mother is the Queen. I'm Princess Bala! \n[83]What do you mean? \n[84]Oh...my...God. \n[85]MMMffllmmm... \n[86]Z!  Help me!!! \n[87]Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere! \n[88]Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck! \n[89]Z!  You're here! \n[90]Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... \n[91]This is all your fault!!! \n[92]Come on, Z. \n[93]Did you say... \n[94]Z, we made it! \n[95]Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. \n[96]You held onto this all that time? \n[97]Stop!  You don't understand! \n[98]He's...he's dead. You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis. \n[99]Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already. \n[100]Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. \n[101]Z!  You came back! \n[102]There's something going on, Z -- \n[103]They're having a ceremony to open the Megatunnel... \n[104]Oh no... \n[105]Z!  what are you doing? \n[106]Z!!! Wait for me! \n[107]Mom! \n[108]Z...what can we do? \n[109]No, I'm Z. \n[110]A few? ", "FORMICA": "\n[1]Don't give me statistics, Carpenter. I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS! \n[2]Oil that, soldier. \n[3]We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory... \n[4]Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively. \n[5]I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all? \n[6]Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you? \n[7]Conversation...yes...well... Wasn't she briefed? \n[8]I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile -- \n[9]Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship? \n[10]Outstanding.  Princess...? \n[11]Well... I declared war! \n[12]Duty calls! \n[13]No squeak.  Outstanding! \n[14]First of all, let me make one thing clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself.  All this \"thinking\" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head. \n[15]We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told.  We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere! Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws! \n[16]Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner! \n[17]Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant. And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed. \n[18]\n[19]Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party! \n[20]Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you. \n[21]Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs. \n[22]Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  Me! \n[23]Affirmative. \n[24]In love? I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors. \n[25]Yes, and do you know why there's a food shortage? \n[26]Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home. \n[27]I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart... \n[28]They should be... But there's something funny about that soldier. \n[29]May I cut in? \n[30]What's this?  A worker has been masquerading as a war hero?! \n[31]\n[32]Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford any delays on this project! \n[33]Notice the big one, holding hands with the female? \n[34]No one should have to.

You're a good soldier. \n[38]So tell me.  Where's Z? \n[39]Okay, son. \n[40]We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No single ant matters, right? \n[41]Not that one. Or that one. \n[42]Or that one?  Her life doesn't matter, does it? \n[43]Insectopia, hunh?...See why individuality is so dangerous?  It can always be used against you. If this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig.  Send them both back to the tunnel project.  Double their workload. \n[44]What do we have on this \"Insectopia\"? \n[45]Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six. \n[46]Princess Bala.  Good. Where's Z? \n[47]It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself. \n[48]You miss him?  Why? \n[49]Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from. I just hope they're not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see Z again after all. \n[50]Is there anything wrong, your majesty? \n[51]She is, your majesty.  She is. \n[52]Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony. \n[53]'Fraid not, your majesty. Goodbye, your majesty. \n[54]Alright, let's move out! \n[55]Z.  I should have known.  All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing.  All because of one stinking ant. \n[56]\n[57]\n[58]Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me.  I'll make you a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive. \n[59]But if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single...\"individual\" one of you. \n[60]What shall it be, workers? \n[61]Have it your way. \n[62]\n[63]What are you doing?!  ATTACK!! Come on, you yellow-bellies! Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself! \n[64]\n[65]Help...help me... \n[66]Please...I...I can't swim...Help me... \n[67]I guess it does...to the ant.

I was talking about a girl for me. Don't you want your aphid beer? \n[5]Z, we've known each other a long time, right? \n[6]And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning.

But listen, you can share my rations. \n[23]No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans. \n[24]Poor Z -- I should never have let you go! \n[25]Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it! \n[26]You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier! \n[27]Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca... \n[28]No -- an individual! \n[29]Well, it's...someone with his own point of view...someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do! \n[30]Right...because every ant's important! \n[31]We can all be individuals!  Just like \n[32]Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir. \n[33]Oh, no, sir! \n[34]Thank you, sir. \n[35]I...I have no idea, sir. \n[36]That's correct, sir! \n[37]No, sir! \n[38]Wait!
