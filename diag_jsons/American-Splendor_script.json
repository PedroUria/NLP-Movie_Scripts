{"dialogues": {"HARVEY": "\n[1]Joyce... Joyce? \n[2]Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- am I just a character in that book? \n[3]If I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away... \n[4]Doc, you gotta help me. My old lady's dumping me 'cause I can't talk. She says I'm a social embarrassment. Now that she's got her PhD, she's some hot shit academic star an' I'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it. But me bein' a file clerk was fine when I wrote the damn check for her tuition -- \n[5]I just don't get it... We were doin' okay for a while. Then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. I started losin' my voice on the plane. Can you believe that... On the plane, doc? \n[6]\"Ahhh.\" \"Ahhh\" ruined the trip. I got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. I mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. What if she totally forgets what I'm like? Man, it's torture -- \n[7]What? Is it bad, doc? \n[8]It's cancer? First I got marital problems and now yer tellin' me I got throat cancer? Omigod... \n[9]Whew... Okay, okay. But fer how long? \n[10]Months!! \n[11]Look at 'em yakkin'. How do they do it? \n[12]They all make it seem so easy. \n[13]Ay... What is this? \n[14]Whattya mean!! You mean yer dumpin' me?! Fer what? Ah, shit! \n[15]But -- \n[16]Please! Wait, honey... Just listen to what I got to say... \n[17]Plebeian... where the hell did she get that shit? \n[18]Huh? Oh. Hiya, Mr. Boats. \n[19]Yeah. It's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem. It means stay away from the crowds of common ordinary people an' do yer own thing. \n[20]Well I ain't got no woman now. So I'm living like the stoic bird, man. \n[21]Huh? That's an A.M.-F.M. radio he's listening to... They got 'em fixed up now like a pair of earmuffs. \n[22]Well, I don't know. Rock music's got some good qualities. I mean it ain't jazz or nothin'. \n[23]I don't got any of that, Mr. Boats... \n[24]I don't know, Marty. It's got a lamination crack in it... A quarter. Maybe I can get him down. \n[25]Yeah, I know I'm tight, man, but I live on a government wage. \n[26]Yeah, man. How 'bout you? \n[27]That's cool. \n[28]Yeah? I'm into comics myself. \n[29]It's terrific, man! I really dig your work. \n[30]Yeah? Can I get good bread for it? \n[31]Listen man, let's get back to your book. What are you gonna do with it? \n[32]It's more than an exercise. It's breaking ground, man. There's some wild shit in here. \n[33]Yeah, ya don't know the half of it. \n[34]I dunno, man. On the one hand most women gettin' graduate degrees wouldn't give a guy like me the time a' day. An' she married me an' everything, so I gotta give her some kinda credit. But then she got so mean to me in the end. An' it ain't like I tried t'keep her captive or anything like that, y'know? \n[35]An' then on top of it I lost my voice for three months. I still sound like shit, but before I had nothin'. Man, talk about hell. I started forgettin' what I sound like, y'know? So I started writin' stuff down -- stories an' things, my points a' view, ideas. I even published a couple jazz record reviews. I guess that ended up bein' a good thing. \n[36]But don't think I buy into this \"growth\" crap. Everybody talks about how bad experiences can cause ya t'grow, an' all that clich\u00e9d stuff. I've had enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty. Right now, I'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness. \n[37]So how long are ya stayin' in Cleveland? \n[38]What are ya talkin' about? Yer makin' a good living doin' yer art? Sheesh. How many guys get that lucky in their life, huh? \n[39]Ya know man, people are startin' to know the name \"Crumb.\" When you croak you're gonna leave something behind. \n[40]C'mon, man. It sure beats workin' a gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky and sellin' records on the side for a buck. \n[41]Damn it! \n[42]I'm starvin'. \n[43]Shit. Work. \n[44]See, ever since I read your stuff, man I've been thinking I could write comic book stories that were different from anything being done. \n[45]I'm thinkin', the guys who do animal comics and super-hero stuff are really limited 'cause they gotta try to appeal to kids. And underground comics like yours have been really subversive or opened things up politically. But there is still plenty more ta be done with 'em, too, y'know? \n[46]I mean with pictures and words, it could be more of an art form. Like those French movies are. Or De Sica over in Italy, y'know?... So I tried writin' some things about real life. Stuff the everyman's gotta deal with. \n[47]Er, yeah... \n[48]Sorta, yeah. But no idealized shit. No phony bullshit. The real thing, y'know? Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff. \n[49]Really? Ya think so? \n[50]Wow!! \n[51]You'd do that for me, man? That'd be great! I can't draw a straight line! \n[52]I don't know, man! I guess you cured me! \n[53]See that? All stories by yours truly. \n[54]No way, Jack, I don't go in for that macho crap. \n[55]Nah! I don't draw. I just write the stories. A buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work. \n[56]Yeah! Yeah! You're in there, alright? Jeez, Toby. \n[57]Cut it out. Man, I ain't nothin' yet compared to Bob Crumb. \n[58]I got a job... I got a job... \n[59]Huh? Sure, I'll take 'em. \n[60]Hey, watermelon. That's pretty good. \n[61]Hey Toby, can you eat lentils during lent? \n[62]Ya think there's any connection between lentils and lent? \n[63]Sister Mary Fred, huh? Is she cute? Sounds kinda mannish but who am I to be picky. \n[64]So what? Maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy. \n[65]Higher calling. That is such a crock of shit. I don't know why you waste your time prayin' anyway. \n[66]What? Do I seem depressed, Toby? \n[67]Yeah! I'll have two crullers, a jelly donut with powdered sugar... And you got any \"day old bread\"? \n[68]Yeah... \n[69]Oh yeah. College. We had a couple lit classes together. \n[70]I know, man. I got good grades and all but there was this required math class. I can't do math, an' that required class hangin' over my head made me crazy. Eventually the pressure got to be too much. \n[71]Ya did? \n[72]Yeah. I'm not doing as great as ya think. My second wife divorced me and I work at a dead end job as a file clerk. Sometimes I hang out with the guys on the corner but most of the time I just stay home by myself and read. \n[73]I'm reading this book by Dreiser now -- \n[74]I hope it don't end like so many a' those naturalist novels... With someone getting crushed ta earth by forces he can't control. \n[75]Nice car. I don't have one yet. \n[76]Nah. It's a nice day. I'll just walk. \n[77]Sure, I'd be glad t'come. But if you really wanna do me a favor, introduce me to some a' your single girlfriends. I bet they're all smart like you. I'm no catch, though, so I'll take anything you can get me. \n[78]...man, she's got good lookin' handwritin'... \n[79]Dear Joyce, Thanks for the letter. Whattya do besides sellin' comics? \n[80]Sounds familiar. So you married or what? \n[81]Look, I think you an' I got a lot in common. How am I gonna get you to come visit me in Cleveland? \n[82]It's a great idea. You should meet me, 'cause I'm a great guy. Despite the way my comics read, I got a lot of redeeming characteristics. \n[83]With me. Don't worry, I'm not gonna put no moves on you or anything. \n[84]So what are ya worried about then? \n[85]Those are motion lines. I'm an active guy. Anyway, just come out here an' I'll try to be anyone you want me ta be. \n[86]Hey. Are you Joyce? \n[87]Hiya. Look, before we get started with any of this, ya might as well know right off the bat. I had a vasectomy. \n[88]What's wrong? \n[89]Somethin's wrong. Yer lookin' around everywhere. \n[90]Me? I never been here. I thought you'd like it. But obviously ya don't, do ya? \n[91]I dunno. None, I guess. They sure got a lot of meat on this menu. \n[92]Kinda. I mean ever since I got a pet cat, I couldn't eat animals anymore. \n[93]Wow. Yer a sick woman, huh? \n[94]Look, I was gonna clean up, but why should I give you any false notions? The truth is I got a serious problem with cleanliness. I could wash a dish ten times and it'd still dirty. They even kicked me outta the Army 'cause I couldn't learn ta make a bed. \n[95]What, ya got a headache? \n[96]Well lemme tell ya Joyce, it sure is nice ta have company. I mean, despite all your problems, you seem like a great person. An' hey, sorry if my dating skills are kinda rusty, but I've just been through hell and back with women. I mean that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch. \n[97]Yeah? You had a nice time? \n[98]Oh, sorry. \n[99]Yeah? \n[100]Hey, Joyce! What's wrong? What is it? \n[101]I feel terrible. Lemme at least do something for you. \n[102]Can I make ya something? How about some chamomile tea? \n[103]I dunno. I noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talkin' on the phone. So I stocked up on herbal teas for your visit. \n[104]The girl at the Food Co-op picked me out all kinds of herbal stuff. One of 'ems good for stomachaches. Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint, I think. Are you still there? \n[105]Man, am I glad I talked you into comin' up here. Any more time alone and I mighta lost it fer good. \n[106]So you don't have any problems with movin' to Cleveland? \n[107]An' yer okay with the vasectomy thing? \n[108]Ay Toby. \n[109]Can I have a fry? \n[110]Whattya got, a church function? \n[111]Nah. I gotta fly to Delaware tonight. I'm gettin' married. \n[112]The chick I'm marryin' is from Wilmington. Plus, I gotta help her move her stuff here. Why you drivin' ta Toledo to see a movie? \n[113]Yeah. We met last week. \n[114]Toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for? \n[115]Wow, ya really dig this movie. \n[116]What are these nerds like? How would you describe them? \n[117]So what yer sayin' is you identify with those nerds? \n[118]So the nerds won, huh? \n[119]Wow. You got this movie an' I'm gettin' hitched. We both had a good month, huh? \n[120]I'm only goin' for a week but then I'll have a wife, so I'll have to take her along. Is it a girl flick? \n[121]I don't know, man. Maybe. She's into herbal teas. \n[122]It's an entertaining flick an' I can see why you like it Toby, but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you! They're college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs. They're gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being nerds. \n[123]Look Toby, the guys in that movie are not 28-year-old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto. \n[124]They didn't get their computers like you did -- by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49.50 at the supermarket. \n[125]Sure, Toby. Go to the movies and daydream, but \"Revenge of the Nerds\" ain't reality. It's just Hollywood bullshit. \n[126]Are ya kidding? No way, man. I ain't getting rid of my 78's. \n[127]I'll get rid of stuff. Just not my good stuff. \n[128]Aw come on, baby. I'll make room for ya. You just have to give me time. I'm not so good at these kind of things. \n[129]C'mon. I don't wanna hear that psychobabble crap! \n[130]Hey Joyce, it's me. You're not gonna believe this but some LA producer called an' he wants to do a play about my life. Call me! \n[131]I hate checkin' bags, man. It always takes forever. \n[132]Jesus, look at the time. The bus is gonna leave soon and there won't be another one for an hour. That means I gotta shell out an extra thirty bucks for a cab. \n[133]Hey wait, there's our -- Figures. That lucky Yuppie's gonna get on the bus in time. \n[134]Damn Yuppies get everything. \n[135]What? Whattya talkin' about? I don't want kids. An' I came clean about my vasectomy the first time I set eyes on ya', right here in this airport. \n[136]Family?! What kinda family could we possibly be? I ain't no good with kids. I can barely take care of myself. \n[137]No way Joyce. Forget it. I can't do it; I can't have no kids. \n[138]Where the hell is that Ornette Coleman album, Joyce? I got a review due tomorrow. \n[139]But it's one o'clock! How late can a person sleep? \n[140]We can go out for dinner tonight. How 'bout catching a bite at Tommy's? \n[141]I give up. \n[142]Hey Joyce, we got a message here. Why didn't you pick up. \n[143]Useless. \n[144]What the hell? \n[145]Aw, c'mon. Who the hell cares? \n[146]Hey, whattya doin? \n[147]I'm gettin' hungry back here. They oughtta leave ya donuts or somethin'. \n[148]Hey, you got anything ta eat? My stomach's growling. \n[149]He's got it at the desk. Will you relax about that already? \n[150]I'm ready for those Cleveland jokes. Go ahead... \n[151]That's right. \n[152]No. It's all true, David. All true. \n[153]That's right. Aiding the sick, yes. \n[154]Thank you. Thank you. \n[155]To make a living! I don't make a living as a writer. I've been writing for many years, David. Maybe more years than you've been alive. \n[156]Yeah, I know that my youthful appearance belies, you know, my actual age. But, I've been around for a long time -- \n[157]Who? What people? What people? What are you talking about? Where the hell do you get that stuff? \n[158]I'm no show biz phoney. I'm telling the truth. Come on, man. \n[159]Then what's the matter? \n[160]My wife made it. \n[161]That's right. \n[162]Thirty-four bucks. \n[163]What are ya cheap. You cheaper than me? \n[164]No but I'm not asking it. My wife is. \n[165]Whad'ya think? \n[166]Go ahead and laugh, folks. But he has more contempt for you than I do! \n[167]Fuckin' yuppie or whatever kinda freak you are. \n[168]Yeah, that's me. \n[169]Yeah? Then why dontcha buy one of my comics, man. That's the only reason I go on that dumb show anyway. \n[170]Asshole. \n[171]Whoa whoa, wait a second. Jerusalem? I can barely drag you off the futon to go to the Letterman show. \n[172]Hey! You know I only go on the show for the extra bread! \n[173]Maybe if you got yer lazy ass up and got a job, I could work on something that matters, too, huh?! \n[174]I'm sorry, baby. I -- I'm sorry... \n[175]This is crazy. Can't ya just do somethin' here in Cleveland? \n[176]Alright... Be careful. I love you, baby. \n[177]What do I care! Just gimme the chart already! \n[178]Look, Miguel! I just don't wanna keep comin' back here for it, okay?! \n[179]How many times do we gotta go through the same bullshit. Just gimme the fuckin' chart! \n[180]Whadya mean? Another two weeks? Ya gotta come home some time! Hello? \n[181]Okay, asshole. You'll pay for that one... \n[182]Hey, Dave! You wanna know what my politics are? I'm a strident leftist, Dave. \n[183]You coulda guessed all of it, man! So why don't we talk about your parent company, G.E., huh? Let's talk about anti-trust violations and nuclear reactors! \n[184]You're a cop-out, Letterman. You're nothin' but a shill for G.E. \n[185]Don't worry, Dave. I won't come back unless you beg me. \n[186]What do I care -- \n[187]So what?! \n[188]Dave, you're fulla shit! You're fulla shit!! \n[189]Who cares. He wasn't helpin' my sales anyway. Baby, don't go away anymore. I just can't take bein' alone. \n[190]But if you go again I'm really gonna lose it. \n[191]How can I have cancer? I don't feel sick at all. \n[192]My cousin Norman died of lymphoma. He was twenty-nine. He was a brilliant oncologist. \n[193]What's going to happen to you, baby? Who's gonna take care of you if I'm not around? \n[194]But that's you. I'm not strong enough. I don't know how ta be positive. I can't do it. I can't. \n[195]I can't do that. I'm just not strong enough... I just wanna die. \n[196]Shit! \n[197]Damnit! \n[198]Joyce, open the door! I lost my keys again! Joyce!! \n[199]Joyce!! Open the fucking door!! \n[200]Fred? \n[201]Sheesh. Joyce doesn't know what she's doing. There's too many words in these frames. When are ya comin' back? \n[202]Next week my treatment begins. Do me a favor. Bring the kid with you. \n[203]I wanna die... just let me die... \n[204]Joyce... Joyce? \n[205]Tell me the truth. Am I some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? Or am I just -- just a character in that book? \n[206]When I die, will 'dat character keep goin'? Or will he just fade away. \n[207]My name is Harvey Pekar. It's an unusual name -- Harvey Pekar... \n[208]1960 was the year I got my first apartment and my first telephone book. Imagine my surprise when I looked up my name and saw that, in addition to me, another Harvey Pekar was listed! \n[209]I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar... My middle name is Lawrence... He was listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle initial... Therefore, his was a purer listing. \n[210]Then, in the seventies, I noticed that a third Harvey Pekar was listed in the phone book! This filled me with curiosity. \n[211]How could there be three people with such an unusual name in the world, let alone in one city?! \n[212]Then one day, a person I worked with expressed her sympathy to me concerning what she thought was the death of my father. She pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of his sons was named Harvey. These were the other Harvey Pekars. \n[213]Six months later, Harvey Pekar Jr. died. Although I'd met neither man, I was filled with sadness. \"What were they like,\" I thought. It seemed that our lives had been linked in some indefinable way. \n[214]But the story does not end there. For two years later another Harvey Pekar appeared in the directory. What kind of people are these? Where do they come from, what do they do? What's in a name? \n[215]Who is Harvey Pekar? \n[216]Hey Joyce. \n[217]That was the doctor. \n[218]He said I'm all clear. \n[219]Ya keep readin' 'em backward. \n[220]I keep tellin' ya, all of 'ems me, man. \n[221]Yeah, well wait'll ya see what you're gonna look like. \n[222]Sure. Yer part of the story too, now. \n[223]The story of my life. \n[224]Yeah, I know I'm not as interesting as The Little Mermaid and all that magical crap... \n[225]Oh yeah? What about? \n[226]Ya know, you should write about things in your own life. Like school and... ponies... I don't know, girl stuff... \n[227]What, are you embarrassed a' me? I know, I'm embarrassing. I felt the same way about my father. ", "JOYCE": "\n[1]What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up? \n[2]What is it? \n[3]Harvey... \n[4]Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up! \n[5]What happened to the new American Splendor? \n[6]All of them? \n[7]Damn it! I put one aside for myself, next to the register. I didn't even get a chance to read it. \n[8]Maybe I'll call the publisher. But they take so damn long. Shit! Why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster... \n[9]Greetings from the second smallest state in the union, an endless plastics and nylon plantation controlled by giant chemical corporations. \n[10]To make matters more dismal, there are no decent comic book stores in my town, which is why my partner and I opened one ourselves. \n[11]Despite our steadily faltering business, my partner managed to sell the last copy of American Splendor #8 out from under me. I'm a big fan and I hate to wait for a new order. Is there any way I can get it from you direct? Sincerely, Joyce Brabner. \n[12]I'm a sometime activist and I teach writing to prisoners. I try to help them build an interior life and make art out of their monotonous, suffocating routine. \n[13]I'm divorced, thank god. \n[14]Cleveland? You think that's a good idea? \n[15]I don't know. Where would I stay? \n[16]I'm not worried about that... Hold on, I just spilled chamomile tea all over my bathrobe. \n[17]Well, the way all those different artists draw you, I don't quite know what to expect. I mean sometimes you look like a younger Brando, but then the way Crumb draws you -- like a hairy ape with all those stinky, wavy lines radiating off your body -- it's kind of scary. \n[18]That's a dangerous offer. I'm a notorious reformer... \n[19]Hi, Harvey. We finally meet in person. \n[20]Nothing. \n[21]I guess I never imagined you eating in a place like this. \n[22]It's fine. What difference does it make? \n[23]You're a vegetarian? \n[24]Hmm. I support and identify with groups like PETA, but unfortunately I'm a self-diagnosed anemic. Also, I have all these food allergies to vegetables that give me serious intestinal distress. I guess I have a lot of borderline health disorders that limit me politically when it comes to eating. \n[25]Not yet. But I expect to be. Everyone in my family's got some kind of degenerative illness. \n[26]I've seen worse. \n[27]Harvey, go get me water and a few aspirin. \n[28]No, but I want to avoid one. \n[29]I had a nice time with you, too. \n[30]Don't make people repeat themselves. It's annoying. \n[31]C'mere... \n[32]Harvey? \n[33]Which door's the bathroom? \n[34]Ugh! I don't know. I think that yuppie food did me in. \n[35]Chamomile tea? What the hell's a guy like you doing with that? I thought you drink soda pop for breakfast. \n[36]Harvey, we better skip this whole courtship thing and just get married. \n[37]Me too. \n[38]Not really. I find most American cities depressing in the same way. \n[39]I agree with Toby. I think it's a story of hope and tolerance. \n[40]Harvey, what did I say about loud talking? Use your inside voice. \n[41]That's enough, Harvey. \n[42]What about these 78's, Harvey? Can't you sell them to one of those collectors? \n[43]Forget it then. I give up! How can I make more storage space, if you won't get rid of anything? \n[44]Everything's your good stuff. How am I supposed to live here, if there's no room for me? \n[45]That's because you're obsessive compulsive Harvey. \n[46]I don't care if you wanna hear it or not. You're the poster child for the DSM III. I'll have you know that I come from a very dysfunctional family. I can spot personality disorders a mile away... \n[47]Borderline autistic! \n[48]Polymorphously Perverse. \n[49]Paranoid Personality Disorder. \n[50]Delusions of grandeur. \n[51]Y'know Harvey, vasectomies are reversible. \n[52]Are you listening to me? I said vasectomies are reversible. \n[53]I know but things have changed. I think we can be a family. \n[54]I'll take care of the kid and you. \n[55]I didn't touch it, Harvey. Would you let me sleep? \n[56]It happens to be Saturday you selfish sonofabitch! And don't you go telling me what to do. I'm the one who moved into your city, into your home, into your vasectomy and into your screwed- up life. The least you could do is allow me to live here my way. \n[57]I'm not hungry. \n[58]Merchandising. \n[59]People like this show? \n[60]Wait a minute. Where's the doll? \n[61]Such brilliant repartee... \n[62]I'm beginning to wonder. \n[63]Pandering is more like it. \n[64]Damnit. \n[65]I'm trying to get some news. You know there's a big story about to break about the US selling arms to Iran and the Contras. \n[66]Ugh. Just forget it. \n[67]Finally something good. Watch this. \n[68]Megalomaniac. \n[69]Harvey, I've been reading about these kids who grew up in war zones... Palestinians, Israelis, El Salvadorians, Cambodians... These kids are amazing and they're -- \n[70]Anyway, I want to do a political comic book about these kids. There's a conference in Jerusalem in a few weeks, and I can start by doing interviews there. \n[71]Y'know why? 'Cause I don't give a damn about the Letterman show. I want to work on something important to me. Something that matters. \n[72]Harvey... you're yelling... \n[73]Harvey, you'll survive a few weeks alone. \n[74]I guess you did it this time. \n[75]If you met those kids over there and saw what they go through, you wouldn't ask that of me. \n[76]It's not open for discussion, Harvey. I need this in my life right now. \n[77]But I do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much. C'mere... \n[78]Harvey, what is that? \n[79]I don't understand, does \"tumor\" mean the same thing as \"cancer\"? \n[80]That's a positive thing. \n[81]Stop it! You're not going to die, Harvey. You're not. \n[82]Harvey, look at me and focus. We are going to get through this. I understand illness. I know how to handle these things. \n[83]Yes, you can. And I'll tell you how. You'll make a comic book out of the whole thing. You'll document every little detail. And that way you'll remove yourself from the experience until it's over. \n[84]Fine. I'll do it without you. \n[85]Right -- the artist. Come on in. \n[86]Hi, Danielle. What's that you're holding? \n[87]A pony? What's his name? \n[88]Oh, I see. Well, I'm Joyce. Nice to meet both you and Clarissa. \n[89]He's going to work until next week, when he starts the chemo. That's why I wanna get this project started now. Once he's stuck here, I know he'll take over. \n[90]What's wrong, Harvey? What are you doing up? \n[91]What is it? \n[92]Harvey... \n[93]Omigod, Harvey! Harvey, wake up! \n[94]What is it Harvey? ", "REAL HARVEY": "\n[1]Okay. We're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. This is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. You could even say comics saved his life. This guy here, he's our man, Harvey Pekar -- all grown up and goin' nowhere. Although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. For the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. So if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? Ya got the wrong movie. \n[2]Here's our man walking home from the doctor's. He's got the weight of the world on him. And fer what, really? 'Cause his throat's a little screwy? Man, people in India are starvin' to death every day. His problems are nothin'. \n[3]Still, he can't help feelin' paranoid, like some supernatural force is conspiring against him to rob him of his voice. \n[4]Maybe his old lady will go easy on him today, when she sees how upset he is. \n[5]Here's our man -- yeah alright, here's me -- or the guy playin' me, anyway, though he don't look nothin' like me, but whatever. So it's a few months later an' I'm workin' my flunky, file-clerk gig at the V.A. Hospital. My voice still ain't back yet. Things seem like they can't get any worse... \n[6]In the early sixties I was with some buddies at a junk sale looking for some choice sides when I met this shy, retiring cat from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb. You know the guy; Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural an' all -- they made a movie about him, too. \n[7]So Crumb showed me this comic book novel he was working on -- THE BIG YUM YUM BOOK. I'd never seen anything like it. \n[8]Crumb and I hung out a lot back then. We had records and comics in common. \n[9]Eventually people got hip to Crumb's art work and he started hangin' out with a Bohemian crowd. After a while, he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to San Francisco where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground. \n[10]He'd come back ta Cleveland every few years, an' people'd treat him like a celebrity. \n[11]Once he came to visit when I was really feelin' bad. It was right around the time of my throat operation, an' right after my second wife left me. At first it was pretty weird. I mean, here my life was falling apart an' everything was going great for him. I was on my second divorce an' he was a big hit with the chicks. I was a nothin' file clerk and he was this famous cartoonist. \n[12]Here's our man eight comics later, a brand new decade, same old bullshit. Yeah sure, he gets lots of recognition for his writin' now. Sure his comics are praised by all the important media types tellin' people what to think. But so what?  It's not like he makes a livin' at it like Bob Crumb. He can't go an' quit his day job or nothin'. \n[13]Who am I kiddin'. Truth is I'd be lost without my work routine. \n[14]So -- to stave off desperation and feelings of uselessness -- I resigned myself to a menial existence. But hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy life feels worse just before he dies than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just needed a woman. \n[15]My loneliness was unbearable, man. Weekends were the worst. Sometimes in my sleep, I'd feel a body next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb. \n[16]Sure my comics were bringin' me notoriety, but my personal life was in shambles. I thought a little attention would make me feel better. It only made me feel worse. \n[17]When I got home, I finished reading JENNIE GERHARDT. It was real good, way better than I expected. That Alice wuz right. \n[18]Sure Lester -- the main character -- croaks in the end, but at least he's old and dies a natural dignified death. \n[19]I was more alone that weekend than any. All I did was think about JENNIE GERHARDT an' Alice Quinn an' all the decades of people I have known. \n[20]The more I thought, the more I felt like cryin'; Life seemed so sweet an' so sad an' so hard t'let go of in the end. \n[21]But hey, man. Every day's a brand new deal, right? Just keep on workin' and sump'n's bound ta turn up. \n[22]Okay, maybe I was bein' so harsh on Toby onna count a' my own problems. \n[23]Y'see, I wasn't even married a month and my old lady was already showin' signs a' trouble. Granted, I tend ta get married fast 'cause I'll take any woman that'll have me, but this time I really met my match... \n[24]If ya think readin' comics about yer life seems strange, try watchin' a play about it. God only knows how I'll feel when I see this movie. But truth be told, the play wasn't half bad, and we got a free trip outta it. Things were goin' pretty good for a change. Variety called me \"The Blue Collar Mark Twain,\" and Doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of \"American Splendor.\" \n[25]I tried everything but nothin' could get this woman outta bed. \n[26]I mean she wouldn't get a job, wouldn't go out, wouldn't make friends, nothin'. \n[27]Joyce diagnosed herself as \"clinically depressed.\" I don't know what the hell she was goin' through but it was sure takin' it's toll on me. \n[28]Joyce finally got off the futon... \n[29]It became clear pretty fast that I was invited on the show just for laughs. But what the hell did I care? Letterman was an okay guy. Let him take pot shots at me, s'long as I got paid an' got to plug my comics. \n[30]Funny thing is, somethin' about me and Letterman clicked for the viewers. He kept wantin' me back. \n[31]Here was this slick, ambitious guy with millions, winnin' over the country by makin' light of everything. And then there was me... A messy loser with no dough who takes everything too seriously. \n[32]An it wasn't just me gettin' all the attention. As a result of my appearances on Letterman, my buddy Toby Radloff landed a gig on MTV extolling the virtues of White Castle burgers... \n[33]That day on the set with those MTV jerks, I had an epiphany. It seemed that real, salt of the earth people like Toby an' me were bein' coopted by these huge corporations. We were gettin' held up and ridiculed as losers in the system.  What can I say, it was the 80's man. \n[34]I guess it was good ta finally see Joyce excited about somethin' of her own. Sure I was happy for her. But I was still upset for me. \n[35]It was later that night when I first found the lump. \n[36]I was determined to put it outta my mind until Joyce got back. Easier said than done. \n[37]I was startin' ta lose it. Between the lump, the loneliness -- I felt like everything wuz closin' in on me. And with Joyce over there savin' the world, I never felt more like a sell-out hack in my life. \n[38]Here's our man a year later. Somehow I made it through the treatments, an' the doctors are optimistic. I guess Joyce was right about doin' the big comic book. We published the thing as a graphic novel -- our first collaboration -- and ended up with rave reviews. We even won the American Book Award. Go figure... \n[39]The weirdest thing that came outta my illness was Danielle. With her real mother runnin' around who knows where, an' seein' how well her and Joyce got on, Fred decided she'd have a better life with us. I was scared at first but then I thought, what the hell. She's a good kid. So we ended up takin' her an' raising her as our own. \n[40]Yeah, so I guess comics brought me a lot. But don't think this is some sunny, happy ending. Every day is still a major struggle. Joyce an' I fight like crazy, an' she barely works. The kid's got A.D.D. and is a real handful. My expenses have gone up so much that I'm writin' freelance 'round the clock, just to make my bills. My life is total chaos. \n[41]With a little luck, I'll get a window of good health between retirin' an dyin'. The golden years, right? Who knows. Between my pension and the chunk of change I got for this movie, I should be able to swing somethin'. Sure I'll lose the war eventually, but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way. Right? ", "TOBY": "\n[1]Hi Harvey. You weren't in work today. Are you okay, Harvey? \n[2]I'm heading downtown to the White Castle. Wanna come, Harvey? \n[3]Harvey, am I in here? You promised I would be in here. \n[4]Mr. Boats, it's not polite to grab things. Next time -- \n[5]Hi, Harvey. Do you want these gourmet jelly beans? I gave up sweets for lent. \n[6]I recommend the pi\u00f1a coladas. They are excellent and very authentic tasting. \n[7]Sure. I don't see why not. You can't eat meat on certain days, but lentils should be acceptable anytime. \n[8]I don't think so but I'll ask Sister Mary Fred at church on Sunday. \n[9]Harvey, you're funny. She's a nun. \n[10]Harvey, she became a nun because she had a higher calling. \n[11]Well, Harvey, I like the ritual. And I'm a very spiritual person. You know, you should try believing in something bigger than yourself. It might cheer you up. \n[12]No you can't have any of my White Castle hamburgers so please don't even ask. \n[13]Okay, but just a couple, Harvey. I'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over. \n[14]No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie. Would you like to come? \n[15]Oh. Why Delaware? \n[16]It's not playing at the Mapletown. I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Harvey. \n[17]It's a new film called \"Revenge of the Nerds.\" It's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. I already saw it once. \n[18]I like it a lot, Harvey. \n[19]Hmm... Nerds are smart but they look and act differently than other people. Like nerds might wear polyester button- down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are showing. \n[20]Yes, I consider myself a nerd. And this movie has uplifted me. There's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. Then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward... So nearly everyone in the place does. That's the way the movie ends. \n[21]Yes. \n[22]Right. Harvey, how long are you going to be in Delaware because I'd really like to see this movie with you? \n[23]Depends on the girl. What kind of girl is your new bride? Is she a nerd? \n[24]Yes. It's about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes. \n[25]You're funny Harvey. \n[26]Hello Joyce. Is Harvey home? \n[27]Hamburgers are a safer addiction than drugs. Say no to drugs. Say yes to White Castle! ", "LETTERMAN": "\n[1]Okay. Our next guest works as a file clerk in a Cleveland hospital. \n[2]...He also writes comic books which detail his day-to-day pains and pleasures, and this is an anthology of nine of those comics. It's entitled AMERICAN SPLENDOR... From off the streets of Cleveland, please say hello to Harvey Pekar. \n[3]Alright settle down Harvey. Settle down. Now let's explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work what it is you do here, exactly. You have comic books about you in your daily life in Cleveland. \n[4]And are they embellished at all or is it pretty much factual? \n[5]And you also have a regular job in Cleveland working at a hospital. \n[6]Aiding the sick. Well that's certainly noble work. \n[7]Now it seems to me Harvey that you have a very successful career here. This is being published by a major publishing company, Doubleday. Why do you maintain the day job? \n[8]But I have a feeling though, if you wanted to, you could probably get by on what you make selling your work. Because I know people are after you to write other things. You're publishing this anthology... \n[9]Harvey, I know you've got a job. I've got a job. We're both very lucky. We both have jobs. \n[10]We've gotta go. Harvey I like you. I'm on your side. I enjoy the comic books. And here, quickly tell us about the little doll here. \n[11]They're made out of your old clothing. \n[12]And what do these go for? \n[13]Thirty-four dollars? Thirty-four dollars for this? \n[14]Would you pay thirty-four dollars for that? \n[15]Harvey, you are the embodiment of the American dream... \n[16]It is my pleasure to welcome back our next guest, the lovable Harvey Pekar! \n[17]Tell me Harvey, what do you do to get away from the pressure of being -- well, a file clerk? \n[18]I could have guessed half of that. \n[19]First of all, Harvey, what you are saying is not true. Second of all, this is not the place to say it. If you want to talk about this, go somewhere else, because you're not talking about it here!! \n[20]You're not coming back at all. \n[21]Because we've given you many, many chances to talk about things that would be of general interest to people -- \n[22]-- And also to promote your little Mickey Mouse magazine. Your little weekly reader! But you've blown every chance you've got. You're a dork, Harvey! ", "CRUMB": "\n[1]You collect Jay McShann, man? \n[2]Yeah but most of my records are back in Philly. \n[3]This PETER WHEAT book is by Walt Kelly... It's pretty rare. \n[4]Nah! Not yet. \n[5]I hadn't thought about it. It's just an exercise. \n[6]You're spitting on me, Harvey. \n[7]Check it out, man. Pretty scary. \n[8]Uh-huh. \n[9]I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this chick in New York. And I'm really busy with the comic book stuff. It's good bread and all man but I'm getting fed up with the whole scene. \n[10]Yeah, I dunno. \n[11]Yeah, my ashes and some crappy doodles. It's not like I'm Blind Lemon Jefferson or Big Mama Thornton. \n[12]Yeah, well that's true... \n[13]Uh-huh. \n[14]Pass me the ketchup? \n[15]These are about you. \n[16]You turned yourself into a comic hero? \n[17]These are really good, Harv. \n[18]Yeah. This is great stuff, man. I dig it. Can I take them home and illustrate them? \n[19]Hey, what's up with your voice, Harv? All of a sudden it sounds fine. ", "ALICE": "\n[1]Hey, you're Harvey Pekar. \n[2]Alice Quinn. From school. \n[3]What happened to you? You just disappeared after one semester. \n[4]Well, you're doing okay anyway. I heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics. \n[5]Sure, you're famous. Meanwhile I got my degree but I'm just a plain old wife and mother. \n[6]You're luckier than you think. My husband and kids make it impossible for me to cuddle up with a good book. \n[7]That's one of my favorites. \n[8]I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's certainly not a Hollywood happy ending, but it's pretty truthful. Which is rare these days... \n[9]This is me. \n[10]Can I give ya a lift somewhere? \n[11]Well, we should have you over sometime for dinner. \n[12]I'll work on it. \n[13]Nice seeing ya Harvey.

Is that you? \n[4]You look like a monster. \n[5]Me?? \n[6]What story? \n[7]Maybe I want to write my own comic. \n[8]I don't know yet. But not about you. You have enough already. \n[9]Do you have to hold my hand? \n[10]No Harvey. You're just squeezing it too hard. Joyce is right. You are obsessive compulsive. ", "DOCTOR #1": "\n[1]Harvey, stop talking please, and open wide. \n[2]Bad timing, I guess. Now please say \"Ah,\" Mr. Pekar. \n[3]Shhh... \n[4]Uh-huh. \n[5]It's not good. \n[6]Harvey, calm down. It's not cancer. You have a nodule on your vocal chords. Probably from screaming and yelling too much. And if you don't stop talking and give it a rest, you're gonna lose your voice completely. \n[7]A few months. \n[8]See? More of that and you'll do permanent damage. Now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won't have to operate.

Good stuff. \n[6]And there you have it, folks! Another enlightening episode of Stupid Pet Tricks! \n[7]Y'know ladies and gentlemen, when Thoreau wrote that most men lead lives of quiet depression, he obviously had not met our first guest, who happens to lead a life of whining desperation... \n[8]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back, Harvey Pekar.

Is he here? \n[4]Hey, Harvey. \n[5]Here are some ideas we batted around. \n[6]Uh, she said something about next Tuesday, which is fine with me. Only thing is, I might have the kid again. My ex-wife's supposed to take her, but I don't have much faith in her showing up. She is in worse shape than me these days. "}}
