{"dialogues": {"BOOK": "\n[1]You found the body? \n[2]What kid? \n[3]Hi, kid. \n[4]I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? \n[5]There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. \n[6]Who'd you see? \n[7]Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? \n[8]Anybody know about this? \n[9]Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? \n[10]Black... I understand. What else,Sam? \n[11]Try that one again, Sam \u0096 \n[12]All right, talk. \n[13]We were running Zenovitch... That's all I can tell you. But I want it, Terry. I've got a call into Schaeffer. \n[14]I'll buy a dog. \n[15]Go get a cup of coffee, Stan. \n[16]Oh, he's good. \n[17]Yeah. \n[18]Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight \u0096 street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed. \n[19]Maybe. \n[20]Maybe. \n[21]If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months. \n[22]The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing. \n[23]What's-her-name moved to Buffalo. \n[24]Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens \u0096 \n[25]We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area. \n[26]Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide. \n[27]Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that. \n[28]You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, I know a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and I'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved. \n[29]What was that? \n[30]Book. John Book \n[31]Sammy, where's Coalmine? \n[32]Coalmine. \n[33]Put some light on him. \n[34]Look at him. \n[35]Sorry. It's important. \n[36]Where's Timmy and Buck? \n[37]You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs? \n[38]Oh sure, Fred. \n[39]They're Amish. \n[40]Now what's the problem? \n[41]Whacking? \n[42]Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify. \n[43]People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail. \n[44]Look, I'm genuinely sorry... \n[45]They kid a lot. \n[46]What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired. \n[47]Just wanted to see if you were on your toes. \n[48]No. \n[49]Oh? Anything else? \n[50]Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a little help. \n[51]Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved. \n[52]Because \u0096 somehow \u0096 they knew I was getting close. Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops. \n[53]You'll be safe. You don't have to worry. \n[54]Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an I.D. There's no way they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he's safe. \n[55]I mean it. You will be safe. \n[56]It was McElroy, Paul. \n[57]Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it. \n[58]If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum. \n[59]Just us. \n[60]More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department. \n[61]A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days. \n[62]Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as: \n[63]Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send Book down hard and grasping. \n[64]Down, muttering CURSES. \n[65]GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And we HEAR \u0096 from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream. \n[66]Just us. \n[67]No! No hospital! \n[68]Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight. \n[69]Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can. \n[70]Listen to me \u0096 Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it. \n[71]Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual... \n[72]Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass. \n[73]Put my car in the garage and close the door. \n[74]You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy. \n[75]Just do it! \n[76]Home. \n[77]I was wrong. \n[78]I can't. \n[79]There isn't going to be one. \n[80]No, no doctor... \n[81]Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me. \n[82]And when they find me, they'll find your boy! \n[83]Who are they? \n[84]Can I have something to drink? \n[85]Does anybody know I'm here? \n[86]How long? \n[87]How long have I been here? \n[88]Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go. \n[89]Tell him his tea stinks. \n[90]His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the boy something of a jolt. \n[91]Give me that. \n[92]Come here. \n[93]You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel? \n[94]Tell you what \u0096 I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand. \n[95]Call me John. \n[96]You don't want to point that at people you just started calling by their first name. \n[97]Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun - \n[98]Put it up someplace Samuel can't get it. \n[99]Friends? \n[100]Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that? \n[101]Your husband's? \n[102]Something wrong with buttons? \n[103]Hochmut? \n[104]Anything against zippers? \n[105]Quaint? Can't imagine why. \n[106]Where's the nearest telephone? \n[107]No. I'd want a public phone. \n[108]I'm going this morning. \n[109]I know what he said. \n[110]Rachel. \n[111]Thanks. \n[112]My... eh... gun? \n[113]The... bullets? \n[114]Not much good without them. \n[115]It's me. \n[116]Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I? \n[117]I'm coming. \n[118]I hear you. I'll stay in touch. \n[119]Where I'm at is maybe 1890. \n[120]Make that 1790. \n[121]Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do? \n[122]Milking? \n[123]I've seen pictures. \n[124]Not one this big. \n[125]Careful, son \u0096 \n[126]You don't say. \n[127]I thought I was the English. \n[128]Try the house. \n[129]Pigs. \n[130]He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious expertise. \n[131]Oh? What happened to Hochstetler? \n[132]A real fireball. \n[133]I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school. \n[134]I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking. \n[135]Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job. \n[136]Guess I'm not used to so much. \n[137]Sure. \n[138]I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea. \n[139]Hi... \n[140]Not long... A few days. \n[141]You like it... Don't you? \n[142]Next thing you know you'll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles. \n[143]It's not her fault. I \u0096 \n[144]All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we're going to be friends whether you like it or not. \n[145]See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't you for Christ's sake? \n[146]Won him over just like that. \n[147]Later. \n[148]It's been a while. \n[149]Pretty much. \n[150]Yes, sir. \n[151]Hey, Sam... \n[152]What's that, Sam? \n[153]Same to you, Sam. \n[154]Sam? \n[155]As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable to make it happen. And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting it on, looks away. \n[156]TIGHTENING to him, and... \n[157]Last night. \n[158]If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't leave. \n[159]Maybe I ought to learn to drive this thing. \n[160]Pick myself up another useful skill. \n[161]Uh oh, they're leaving us behind. \n[162]Lady, if you take my picture, I'll rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it. \n[163]Lieutenant Elton Carter, please. \n[164]What? I'm a friend of his. \n[165]You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out. \n[166]I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you. \n[167]You might want to pass it along to Mac. \n[168]I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you. \n[169]You're making a mistake. \n[170]Pick up the hat. \n[171]I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun. \n[172]There was. \n[173]I know. \n[174]No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life. \n[175]Aren't you? After today? \n[176]Oh, come on, Rachel. No way. \n[177]Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do! \n[178]That's your way, not mine. \n[179]Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help! \n[180]Looking after her. A face full of loss. \n[181]It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before. \n[182]Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there! \n[183]I'll be all right. You just do as I say. \n[184]I won't. Now run. Fast as you can! \n[185]As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh straw. Book eases back alongside Luke, waits. \n[186]As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the barn. \n[187]Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay mow. \n[188]As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks up. \n[189]Hey, Mac! \n[190]Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in the barn floor just in front of his parked car. \n[191]Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing down out of sight. \n[192]He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks at him with its horns. Book waits, watches. \n[193]Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out.. \n[194]He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the distance to the floor, starts upward again. \n[195]Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, raps on the board smartly once. \n[196]We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it to the floor. McELROY \u0096 FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling forward  as Book seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward. \n[197]He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies stunned. \n[198]It's okay, Sam. \n[199]You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer. \n[200]It's all over, Paul. \n[201]Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read resignation... whatever there was between them has been terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too. \n[202]Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars. \n[203]Sure have, Sam. \n[204]Where's my baggy pants? ", "RACHEL": "\n[1]TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues... \n[2]Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences. \n[3]As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her. At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, tune in as Rachel looks up. \n[4]I'm sure he does, Daniel. \n[5]Daniel? \n[6]I need time, Daniel. \n[7]I see, darling. \n[8]Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore. \n[9]We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where is that train, please? \n[10]Immediately alarmed, intervening. \n[11]What do you want of my son? \n[12]Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. \n[13]May I talk to you? \n[14]Zwartich. It's the way we say... dwarf. Not like him... very big. \n[15]No... No. It is just the English way. \n[16]Where are you taking us? \n[17]You have no right to keep us here. \n[18]You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws! \n[19]It's not a joke. \n[20]He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you. \n[21]John Book, you listen to me! I will have no further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us! \n[22]No! We do not stay in hotels. \n[23]Yes, thank you very much. \n[24]Yes. \n[25]They are English. They don't understand. \n[26]I know. Sleep now, Liebchen. \n[27]Good morning. \n[28]I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish! \n[29]Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee. \n[30]I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. \n[31]Please, I didn't mean... \n[32]I brought your coffee. \n[33]I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. \n[34]Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him. \n[35]At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way. \n[36]You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night. \n[37]Okay. \n[38]The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people. \n[39]Yes. And I also want to leave this city. \n[40]We do not go into your courts. \n[41]No you're not \u0096 You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much. \n[42]I would not be too sure. \n[43]He says you look very tired. I thought the same thing. \n[44]But not a good tired. \n[45]Your sister said you don't have a family? \n[46]She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility. \n[47]Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows. \n[48]I think that's what she said. \n[49]Good appetite. \n[50]Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman? \n[51]But why would they murder... \n[52]I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home. \n[53]Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other! \n[54]Where are you taking us now? \n[55]You couldn't wait until morning? \n[56]What happened? \n[57]You said we would be safe in Philadelphia. \n[58]Kinner un Narre... [\"Kinner un Narre saage die Waahret\" \u0096 \"Children and fools say the truth\" \u0096 Amish expressions] \n[59]Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast. \n[60]What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial? \n[61]His name is John Book. \n[62]But John... why didn't you go to a hospital? \n[63]But why? \n[64]But \u0096 \n[65]No... \n[66]I know. \n[67]It will go when he goes. \n[68]Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus. \n[69]Go help Levi with the car, Samuel. \n[70]No, he must stay here. \n[71]We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows! \n[72]I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel. \n[73]What else can we do? \n[74]Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors. \n[75]Thank you. \n[76]It's all right! You have got to lie still. \n[77]Yes, much better... \n[78]Hello. \n[79]The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life. \n[80]Only the elders. \n[81]What? \n[82]Two days. \n[83]But you can't. \n[84]See. Anyway, you don't have any clothes on. And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better. \n[85]You tell him. When you're able. \n[86]We're all very happy that you're going to live, John Book. We didn't quite know what we were going to do with you if you died. \n[87]He'll leave as soon as he is able. He already wants to go. \n[88]Samuel! \n[89]Wait for me downstairs. \n[90]John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible. \n[91]It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel. \n[92]Please, it has nothing to do with you personally. \n[93]Enjoying your reading? \n[94]Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these. \n[95]Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers. \n[96]I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes. \n[97]Buttons are Hochmut. \n[98]Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain. \n[99]You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint. \n[100]Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even. \n[101]Well... the store at Saltzburg... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while. \n[102]But Stoltzfus said... \n[103]You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry. \n[104]You'd better go. \n[105]Oh. The bullets. \n[106]Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago. \n[107]We had some lemonade and he left. \n[108]You know carpentry? \n[109]What else can you do? \n[110]Whacking is not of much use on a farm. \n[111]I'm sorry. I'm sure it is. \n[112]Tonight I'll let out those trousers for you. \n[113]Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman. \n[114]But... You may not be well enough. \n[115]When will you be going? \n[116]No... You just stop \u0096 \n[117]I have done nothing against the ordnung. \n[118]I have committed no sin. \n[119]That is idle talk. \n[120]I am not a child. \n[121]I will be the judge of that. \n[122]You shame yourself. \n[123]Well... \n[124]I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's. \n[125]Good luck. \n[126]All of them charitable, I'm sure. \n[127]Samuel, who is that? \n[128]Do nothing. This happens from time to time. \n[129]It's not our way, John. We'll have nothing to do with violence! John! \n[130]He's from... Ohio... My cousin. \n[131]John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant. \n[132]Yes. Samuel! We're going. \n[133]You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow. \n[134]There was a time when I thought you might have stayed. \n[135]There was a time when I would have welcomed it. \n[136]I was being foolish? \n[137]You're so sure of that? \n[138]but... her voice rising a bit, annoyed  \n[139]There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land! \n[140]What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven! \n[141]That's God's way! \n[142]I could never love a man who was so... little. \n[143]The other night... when you saw me after my bath... I... I tried to look as I thought you would want a woman to look. I am sorry... that I did not. \n[144]Eli, would you see Samuel to bed? \n[145]No, you listen. Get out! \n[146]You have no right here! \n[147]You might have killed him! \n[148]My son is out there! \n[149]She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel. \n[150]Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in her arms... then to lead him back toward the house. \n[151]I have to help him! \n[152]I want you to take this... to remember by. \n[153]Here. Whenever you want them. ", "SCHAEFFER": "\n[1]How reliable is this kid? \n[2]Amish. \n[3]What have you got? \n[4]So one of them got to him. \n[5]You know who? \n[6]You're still convinced there's a link to the department? \n[7]That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy. \n[8]When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department. \n[9]Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde \u0096 what's-her-name \u0096 come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that. \n[10]Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife. \n[11]I hope you don't have any doubts about that. \n[12]Who else knows? \n[13]Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up \n[14]Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you. \n[15]What's your first move? \n[16]Who else knows? \n[17]Looks like we're going to need some help from you folks down there. \n[18]I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should simplify your work. \n[19]Ah... no. \n[20]Sorry. \n[21]Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an education. \n[22]Not yet. \n[23]Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position. \n[24]Of course, Elaine.

I know he's hiding somewhere with the Amish, I know it. Can you imagine John Book at a prayer meeting? Our John Book? \n[35]Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton. Tell me what you know... \n[36]I'll take it in the study. \n[37]You can hang up, dear. \n[38]How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad. \n[39]Johnny \u0096 \n[40]Listen to me, Johnny. Come in!

We owe you one, Sheriff. \n[42]Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked on the phone. Good work. \n[43]If we need any help, we'll give you a shout. I'd like to slip in there quiet, then get out before we attract any attention. \n[44]They don't have any shit. \n[45]Outside \u0096 Check out the rest of the house. \n[46]We're police officers. We're looking for a fugitive, John Book. He's living here? \n[47]You speak English. Good. Now listen \u0096 \n[48]Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. He's got a gun, hasn't he? \n[49]All right, where is he? \n[50]He'll live. \n[51]Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two. \n[52]On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn. \n[53]Get back in there. \n[54]Nobody's going to hurt your son... \n[55]What the hell happened? \n[56]On the front porch, looking around for the location of the sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, looks back toward the house... frustrated. \n[57]Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. He still can't see Samuel. \n[58]Turning, SHOUTING: \n[59]You stay put! \n[60]Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him. \n[61]Cut that out! \n[62]Get down to the house and stay there! \n[63]Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn. \n[64]He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly: \n[65]Okay, Johnny.

You are able to look into their hearts and see this badness? \n[13]And having seen, you would become one of them? Don't you see...?

You never had your hands on a teat before? \n[24]Have to teach you mules, too, I guess. \n[25]Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite? \n[26]Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite. \n[27]Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter. \n[28]Rachel! \n[29]What is this? This Myusick? \n[30]How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung? \n[31]Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing? \n[32]No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned! \n[33]Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!

He edges away from his mother... \n[5]As he reacts. \n[6]As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes the stall door. \n[7]He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then... \n[8]I saw him. \n[9]No... I saw the man who killed him. \n[10]his clothes and pointing at Carter \n[11]Not Zwartich, like him \u0096 \n[12]Momma... are they angry with us. \n[13]I don't want to stay here. \n[14]I wish dawdie was with us. \n[15]Momma \u0096 look. \n[16]Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn.

And McElroy still smiling as: \n[3]Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book toward McElroy. He smiles at them. \n[4]She say where he is? \n[5]Tight. But I'm working on him. \n[6]Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into? \n[7]He's not in this building. \n[8]Fergie? \n[9]Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS: \n[10]Book, you sneaky bastard, I know you're here! Come out and fight! \n[11]As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice. \n[12]Eyes darting wildly, looking up. \n[13]Diving to one side. \n[14]Staring at the fork pop-eyed. \n[15]Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. The shot smashes the windshield of the car. \n[16]FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY \n[17]Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door. \n[18]Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the cowflops. The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. As he arrives, he HEARS a noise \u0096 very slight \u0096 from the direction of the silo. He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base of the inner ladder, looks up. \n[19]Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand. \n[20]Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard. \n[21]Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety. \n[22]His forward motion has carried him across the silo.

In the b.g. Rachel moves protectively to Samuel's side. \n[5]But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine gasps, Fred manages to grunt. \n[6]A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of Book, looks on edgily: \n[7]A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on. Carter shakes it off, goes. And... \n[8]As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel. \n[9]As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he recoils with alarm. \n[10]As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so. She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at first, then the words take shape \u0096 swear words; curses; fuck this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her. \n[11]Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury: \n[12]Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes. Tschantz rumbles in German. \n[13]Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded clothes. Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN... \n[14]Samuel gives the shaken Book a look: \n[15]As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion crossing her expression for an instant. And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either. Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome. \n[16]As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, brings out some lumps of sugar. \n[17]GOING WITH the trio of gunmen...

As he does so, a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up. Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and a short leather jacket. They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace. The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close confines of the lavatory. \n[3]The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors. \n[4]\n[5]Rachel eyes Book warily.
