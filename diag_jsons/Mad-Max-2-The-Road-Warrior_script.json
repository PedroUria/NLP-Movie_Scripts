PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX: \n[16]Its OK, Dog. Just do as they say... His words are lost in the wail of a siren. A guard perched in the watch tower shouts a warning. The yellow school bus roars across, closing the entrance. \n[17]Two days ago I saw a vehicle that'd haul that tanker. All eyes turn to MAX. \n[18]You wanna get out of here. You talk to me. \n[19]So that's my offer. I deliver a prime mover - in return you give me my black car and as much gas'as I can carry. All I need right now is three jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum. They look at him quizzically. Think of it as a down payment. \n[20]There's only one way to find out.

The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his head back, howling. MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous. The first light of dawn appears on the horizon. MAX turns to the FERAL KID: \n[27]You're a fine kid, but you can't come. You've gotta learn - don't get close to people. It can churn you up... The KID can't understand a word, so just grins. MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces the hurdy-gurdy. He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the door and pushes him out. \n[28]I'll drive the tanker... Everybody stops, turning to look at him. MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands clenched, \n[29]Until you're clear of trouble...

He snaps the gun shut and tries to aim it at the GAYBOY BERSERKER... but can't find the trigger. The GAYBOY BERSERKER raises the crossbow... MAX grabs the gun and fires...

MAX lays the snake on the rotor. \n[3]Sounded like a big V-8 to me. I guess I got myself some guzzolene. He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing to fire. \n[4]Drop the weapons... Now back up. MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn-off shotgun. The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder. \n[5]You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that's what you've got. Me? I've got brains. He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black. \n[6]Now, where's this booby-trap?

His fingers wrap around the handle. \n[7]A fella - a quick fella - might He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head. \n[8]Then I'd have to pin his head to the panel. MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back. \n[9]Oh no! You don't play me the fool. The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S head, opens the door. The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat. The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r itself in the car door.

MAX is driving the black-on-black while the CAPTAIN sits rigid in the passenger's seat. The muzzle of the shotgun is strapped to the back of his bead and the stock fastened to the top of the seat. A length of wire runs from the triggers across to the DOG sitting in the rear of the car. The end of the wire is clasped firmly in its mouth. The CAPTAIN, not daring to take his eyes off the DOG directs MAX along back roads to an area of high country. The DOG'S eyes dart out the window. He whimpers, body twitching. The CAPTAIN stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through the scrub. MAX smiles t') himself. The DOG settles back. i8. A CLIFFTOP OVERLOOKING THE COMPOUND. DAY. MAX moves towards the cliff edge. A column of smoke rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant sounds: police sirens; car horns; men screaming; war-whoops; and revving motors. The GYRO CAPTAIN - manacled and guarded by the DOG - hobbles along behind MAX. From the top of the cliff MAX looks down On a battle raging on the plain below. A fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch and coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large gang of MARAUDERS: MOHAWK BIKERS, SMEGMA CRAZIES in dune buggies, and GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers. They attack along a road which passes through an area - outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation. Three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a newly-ploughed field. As the Marauders' vehicles come within range of the compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing crossbows at the DEFENDERS ranged along the battlements. \n[14]Okay, there it is. If anyone can get in, I know it's gonna be you. Me,.. I've gotta feed the snakes. Sc. 21, Cont - 21,. Cont. MAX drops the binoculars. The CAPTAIN offers his wrists to be unmanacled. \n[15]A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine... MAX gets to his feet and hauls the GYRO CAPTAIN to a nearby tree stump. \n[16]Look! We had a deal: I show you the gas - You let me go. MAX starts to chain him to the stump. \n[17]What's up!! MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below. ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS, camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp, Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It passes out-of sight around the back of the hill, MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop. \n[18]Jesus! He's gonna kill her. MAX whips his telescope around... 38, \n[19]Hey! What about me?!! \n[20]You can't just dump me! Think of us as partners. MAX tosses him a set of keys, shouting over the engire. \n[21]What sort of deal's that?! I'm running on empty! \n[22]Watch your tyres! Turn left!

MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious. As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky, stiff-legged gait. \n[25]I know you're afraid darlin'. But I'll let you into a secret, sweetheart. I'm afraid too. He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand. \n[26]I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent. \n[27]I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp. \n[28]Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head. \n[29]Thanks. Thanks a lot. The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders. MAX opens the door of the black-on-black.

And it died with him. PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the crowd, back towards his tent. The WARRIOR WOMAN puts a bow to MAX'S temple and shoves him towards the gate. \n[4].and we walk out of here with our lives. What then? Do we wander the wasteland - scavenging. Wake up one morning and find we're just like them - savages. He points in the direction of the MARAUDERS. \n[5]Is that what you want? I don't. 5!. cont. 57, PAPPAGALLO Cont. I came out here and I found that pump. I built that plant and ploughed that field, Why? Because we are human beings. We must maintain our dignity. We are not barbarians... The crowd is silent... I made one mistake - I waited too long... thinking we could survive here. We can't. But, as frightened as we all are - let's not forget one thing. He points to the tanker of fuel, propped up next tc the cracking plant... That is more than just a tank of fuel. It's our lifeline, our passport to a place beyond the reach of men on machines. He talks over several protesting voices... No! I don't know how we're gonna get there. But the first step is to defend that fuel. I won't surrender it to anyone. I stay! Alone if I have to... \n[6]Open the gate!! The FERAL KID, astride the pump, is on his feet.. BIG REBECCA runs to the yellow school, bus... \n[7]OK! OK! Let's go. We leave tonight!

I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life, I can offer you a future. The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited. \n[11]What are you looking for out there? How long do you expect to survive, scavenging day to day? You're no different than them. He points in the direction of the Marauders.,. ..,vultures, maggots. Don't you see? There is a better way! MAX flares at him, angry: \n[12]You see! That's the alternative! Men feeding on men. MAX goes back to work. The GYRO CAPTAIN slips his arm around LUSTY'S shoulder. \n[13]We're going to use the tanker and the two assault vehicles to punch our way out of here. If I'm right, they'll all go after the tanker. That'll give the rest of you a chance. 124. INT. BREAD VAN. DAY. 12\u00e2\u0080\u00a2x. MAX is sitting up, binding his leg tight with bandages, clipping on his metal knee brace. \n[14]Split up.
