Hi. \n[6]Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny \"cute,\" but when other animals do it, it's a little... \n[7]It's okay-- oh, you've actually you've actually got a-- there's a-- in your neck-- the fold-- the-- there's-- \n[8]I should get to roll call, so... which way do I? \n[9]Great, thank you! \n[10]Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place? \n[11]Parking duty? Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo? \n[12]Sir, you said there were 14 missing mammal cases? \n[13]So I can handle one. You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the academy. \n[14]Sir, I'm not just some \"token\" bunny. \n[15]100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write 100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200 tickets! \n[16]Before noon! \n[17]Boom! 200 tickets before noon. \n[18]201. \n[19]Where'd he go... \n[20]I'm such a... \n[21]Hello? Excuse me? \n[22]Actually... I'm an officer. Just had a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucous with their cookies and cream? \n[23]Well, I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an un-gloved trunk is a Class 3 Health Code Violation... \n[24]...Which is kind of a big deal. Of course-- I could let you off with a warning if you were to glove those trunks and, I don't know, finish selling this nice dad and his son a... what was it? \n[25]A Jumbo Pop. \n[26]Keep the change. \n[27]Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. I just wanna say, you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella. \n[28]Hopps. Mr... \n[29]And you little guy, you want to be an elephant when you grow up... you be an elephant-- because this is Zootopia, anyone can be anything. \n[30]Toot, toot! \n[31]Goodbye! \n[32]Oh! Hey, little toot toot-- \n[33]Well. I stood up for you, and you lied to me. You liar! \n[34]Hey! \n[35]Alright, slick Nick, you're under arrest. \n[36]Gee I don't know, how `bout selling food without a permit, transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines, false advertising... \n[37]You told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood! \n[38]You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots... \n[39]Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke County, and I grew up in Bunnyburrow. \n[40]Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I can or can't be! Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a popsicle hustler! \n[41]I am NOT a dumb bunny. \n[42]Oh hey, it's my parents! \n[43]It was real great. \n[44]Mmm. Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice. And I feel like I'm really making a difference-- \n[45]Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is just a temporary thing-- \n[46]Dad! Dad-- \n[47]DAD!

I am a real cop... \n[51]Sir, if you have a grievance, you may contest your citation in traffic court. \n[52]Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I got this! \n[53]Stop! Stop in the name of the law! \n[54]I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit! \n[55]You! Freeze! \n[56]Stop! \n[57]Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through! `Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon... \n[58]Hey! Stop right there! \n[59]I love your hair. \n[60]I popped the weasel! \n[61]Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus varietal called Midnicampum Holicithias. They're a Class C Botanical, sir. I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing. \n[62]Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job. \n[63]Sir, I don't want to be a meter maid... I wanna be a real cop. \n[64]But sir, if you-- \n[65]I will find him. \n[66]What? Why?! \n[67]Like glue! \n[68]Thank you, ma'am. \n[69]\n[70]Okay. \n[71]Oh, uh... okay... deal. \n[72]That's it?! \n[73]Okay. \"Last known sighting...\" \n[74]Can I just borrow-- Thank you. \n[75]Pawpsicle. \n[76]Get your pawpsicle... \n[77]It means I... have a lead. \n[78]Hi! Hello? It's me again! \n[79]Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case. \n[80]This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of popsicles can wait. \n[81]Please, just look at the picture. \n[82]You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle right? Do you know him? \n[83]Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way. \n[84]Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest. \n[85]Felony tax evasion. \n[86]Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days a year... since you were 12, that's two decades, so times twenty... \n[87]...which is one million four- hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we are good at multiplying-- anyway, according to your tax forms... ...you reported let me see here: zero. Unfortunately, lying on a federal form is a punishable offense. Five years jail time. \n[88]Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter or the only place you'll be selling popsicles is the prison cafeteria. It's called a hustle, sweetheart. \n[89]Start talking. \n[90]Great, let's go. \n[91]Don't call me cute. Get in the car. \n[92]Hi, hello. \n[93]Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?! \n[94]Hello! My name is-- \n[95]Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD. I'm looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton. Right here-- --who may have frequented this establishment. \n[96]Oh, thank you so much, I'd appreciate that more than you can imagine. It would be such a big-- You are naked! \n[97]Yes there is. \n[98]You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you? \n[99]0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great info, thank you. \n[100]The plate... I can't run a plate... I'm not in the system yet. \n[101]What was it you said? \"Any moron can run a plate?\" Gosh... if only there were a moron around who were up to the task... \n[102]Not forever. Why, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not? \n[103]I hope so, we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. Wait. They're all sloths?! \n[104]You said this was going to be quick! \n[105]Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are ya? \n[106]Fine? \n[107]Well, I was hoping you could run a plate-- \n[108]Well, I was hoping you could-- \n[109]Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We are in a really big hurry. \n[110]\n[111]\n[112]\n[113]\n[114]\n[115]Mmhmm. 0, 3. \n[116]3! \n[117]No! \n[118]Three humped camel. \n[119]Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task-- \n[120]Oh no! \n[121]No! \n[122]A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just- - \n[123]Aggggggghhhhhhh-- \n[124]Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you! \n[125]29THD03-- it's registered to... Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown! \n[126]Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and-- \n[127]\n[128]Closed. Great. \n[129]You wasted the day on purpose. \n[130]It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see-- See him? This otter is missing. \n[131]What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life? \n[132]Fine. We are done. Here's your pen. \n[133]The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause, and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty low-life climbing the fence, so you're helping plenty. Come on. \n[134]29THD03... this is it. \n[135]Polar bear fur. \n[136]What? What?! \n[137]Those are... claw marks. You ever seen anything like this? \n[138]Oh, wait. Look. \n[139]This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here. What do you think happened? \n[140]Why? Whose car is it? \n[141]I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene. \n[142]What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you? \n[143]Oh, sweet cheese and crackers. \n[144]Is that Mr. Big? \n[145]What about him? Is that him? \n[146]That's gotta be him. \n[147]Sir, I am a c-- \n[148]No. I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car, so intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do. \n[149]Hi. I love your dress. \n[150]Because he was attacked. \n[151]Otterton? \n[152]He's a sweet little otter. \n[153]Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We just want to know what happened to Emmitt Otterton. \n[154]What... happened? \n[155]Yep. So, uh, you just open the door and tell us what you know and we will tell you what we know. Okay? \n[156]Clever fox. \n[157]Mr. Manchas? \n[158]Are you... okay? \n[159]Run. RUN! \n[160]I don't know!! \n[161]Jump! \n[162]Head down! \n[163]Officer Hopps to dispatch! \n[164]\n[165]Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tu-junja! \n[166]There! Head to the skytrams! \n[167]Go! \n[168]I'm gonna let go! \n[169]One, two-- \n[170]Well. That's what we do at the \n[171]I thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. \n[172]Mr. Otterton did not just disappear. I believe he and this jaguar, they... went savage, Sir. \n[173]I thought so too, `til I saw this: \n[174]What? He was right here... \n[175]Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost killed us. \n[176]Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one who saw him! Nick! \n[177]Well he was a key witness and I enlisted-- \n[178]But, Sir, we... \n[179]Thank you. \n[180]So, things do get to you... \n[181]Har-har. \n[182]...And two? \n[183]Nick, you are so much more than that... \n[184]Nick, I'm glad you told me... \n[185]Seriously, it's okay... \n[186]The traffic cams would have caught it! \n[187]Pretty sneaky, Slick. \n[188]No... But I have a friend at City Hall who might. \n[189]Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need your help. \n[190]We just need to get into the traffic cam database. \n[191]Hey! \n[192]You can't just touch a sheep's wool... \n[193]Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga. \n[194]But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia. \n[195]Shush. Okay, traffic cams... Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in. \n[196]Who are these guys? \n[197]Howlers! Night howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of... wolves! The wolves are the night howlers. If they took Manchas... \n[198]All we gotta do is find out where they went. \n[199]Wait. Where'd they go? \n[200]Well, look at you, Junior Detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop. \n[201]They're heading out of town... Where does that road go? \n[202]Come on! \n[203]It looks like this was a hospital. \n[204]All this equipment is brand new... \n[205]Claw marks... \n[206]Mr. Manchas. \n[207]It's him. We found our otter. Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to find you. We're gonna get you out of here now. \n[208]...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including Manchas it's 14... Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing Mammal files... They're all here. All the missing mammals are right here. \n[209]Can you swim? \n[210]We gotta tell Bogo! \n[211]Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything-- \n[212]You were just trying to protect your job. \n[213]You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law... \n[214]Rrrgh. I am so nervous... \n[215]You should be there with me. We did this together. \n[216]Funny you should say that, because I've been thinking... it would be nice to have a partner. \n[217]Here. In case you need something to write with. \n[218]Yes? \n[219]Well, the animals in question... Are they all different species? Yes. Yes they are. \n[220]Well, all we know is that they are all members of the predator family. \n[221]That is accu-- Yes, that is accurate. Yes... \n[222]We still don't know-- \n[223]Ah, it may have something to do with biology. \n[224]A biological component. You know, something in their DNA... \n[225]Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. \n[226]It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you... \n[227]Was I okay? \n[228]That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we-- \n[229]What do you mean? \n[230]I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage... \n[231]Nick, stop it. You're not like them. \n[232]You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator. \n[233]No. Nick. Nick! \n[234]No. He's my friend. \n[235]That is not what I said! Please! \n[236]The Mayor? Why? \n[237]Clawhauser? What're you doing? \n[238]What? \n[239]Um... I don't understand. \n[240]I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it. \n[241]With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect-- help the city. Not tear it apart. I don't deserve this badge. \n[242]Thank you for the opportunity. \n[243]A dozen carrots. \n[244]Have a nice day. \n[245]Why did I think I could make a difference? \n[246]Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. \n[247]Is that... Gideon Grey? \n[248]That's really cool, you guys. \n[249]Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. \n[250]Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk... \n[251]I'm sorry, what did you say? \n[252]A bunny can go savage... \n[253]Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing! \n[254]Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry! Come on! Thank you, I love you bye! \n[255]I need to find Nick. Please. \n[256]Nick? Nick! \n[257]Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't wolves. They're toxic flowers. I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage. \n[258]Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded... But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you. \n[259]And after we're done, you can hate me, and that'll be fine, because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you... and you can walk away knowing you were right all along, I really am just a dumb bunny. \n[260]I'm sorry. \n[261]We are gonna follow the night howlers. \n[262]Know this guy? \n[263]We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those night howlers, Wessleton? \n[264]Aw. \n[265]And to whom did you sell them? \n[266]Come on! \n[267]The weasel wasn't lying. \n[268]We need to get this evidence to the \n[269]No. All of it! \n[270]All right. One toot-toot. \n[271]Don't stop! Keep going! \n[272]Do not stop this car! \n[273]Speed up, Nick! Speed up! \n[274]Trust me! SPEED! UP! \n[275]Hey. Need some help? \n[276]Okay... Maybe some of the evidence survived. \n[277]Everything is gone. We've lost it all. \n[278]Oh, Nick! Yes! \n[279]Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD. Cut through the Natural History Museum! \n[280]Oh! There it is! \n[281]Mayor Bellwether! We found out what's happening. Someone's darting predators with a serum-- that's what's making them go savage. \n[282]Thank you, ma'am. How did you know where to find us? \n[283]You know what... I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD... \n[284]Ach! \n[285]Pass. \n[286]Take the case. Get it to Bogo. \n[287]I can't walk. \n[288]What are you going to do? Kill me? \n[289]No! Nick?! \n[290]No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it. \n[291]So that's it, prey fears predator, and you stay in power? \n[292]It won't work. \n[293]Oh, Nick! No! \n[294]Blood, blood, blood! And death. \n[295]What you've got in the weapon there- - those are blueberries. From my family's farm. \n[296]Oooo, actually-- \n[297]--It's your word against yours. It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom. \n[298]When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything... \n[299]Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. \n[300]We all have limitations. We all make mistakes. Which means-- hey, glass half full!-- we all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. \n[301]So, no matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox... \n[302]I implore you... try. Try to make the world a better place. \n[303]Look inside yourself, and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us. \n[304]Oops. Sorry. \n[305]Dumb fox. \n[306]Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do. \n[307]Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour. I hope you have a good explanation. ", "NICK": "\n[1]I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir. I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop for my little boy. \n[2]You want the red or the blue, pal? \n[3]Uh, no no, there are. There are. It's just, my boy-- --this goofy little stinker-- he loves all things elephant. Wants to be one when he grows up. \n[4]Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right? \n[5]A Jumbo Pop. Please. \n[6]Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't have my wallet. I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck, that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry pal. Gotta be about the worst birthday ever. Please don't be mad at me. Thanks, anyway. \n[7]Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind, really, can I pay you back? \n[8]Ah, well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so non- patronizing... Officer... \n[9]Wilde. Nick Wilde. \n[10]Ah, boy, I tell him that all the time. All right here ya go-- Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile! All right, give her a little bye-bye toot toot. \n[11]Bye now! \n[12]Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles! \n[13]Lumber delivery! \n[14]The color? Uh... It's redwood. \n[15]39...40. There you go. Way to work that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy? \n[16]It's called a hustle, sweetheart. And I'm not the liar, he is. \n[17]Really, for what? \n[18]Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertise anything. Take care. \n[19]That's right. \"Red wood.\" With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. You can't touch me, Carrots, I been doing this since I was born. \n[20]My bad. I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot- choked podunk, no? \n[21]Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar: Na\u00efve little hick with good grades and big ideas decides, \"Hey lookit me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia-- where Predators and Prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!\" Only to find-- whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of becoming a big city cop? Double whoopsie! She's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie-- NO ONE cares about her or her dreams. And soon enough those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge. Til finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail between her legs to become-- you're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?-- so how `bout a carrot farmer... That sound about right? \n[22]Be careful now, it won't just be your dreams getting crushed. \n[23]Alright look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well you can't. You can only be what you are. Sly fox. \n[24]Dumb bunny. \n[25]Right. And that's not wet cement. \n[26]You'll never be a real cop. You're a cute meter maid though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there... \n[27]Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot. \n[28]What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me. \n[29]Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby, I gotta get to work. \n[30]I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12, and time is money, hop along. \n[31]I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box. \n[32]Did you just boot my stroller? \n[33]For what? Howting your feewings? \n[34]Well, it's my word against yours. \n[35]I don't know where he is. I only saw where he went. \n[36]It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny. \n[37]Okay. You're the boss. \n[38]Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be anything. These guys... they be naked. \n[39]Does this make you uncomfortable? Because, if so, there's no shame in calling it quits. \n[40]Boy, that's the spirit. \n[41]Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu. \n[42]Give me the pen please. \n[43]Rabbit, I did what you asked, you can't keep me on the hook forever. \n[44]Actually, I just remembered I have a pal at the DMV... \n[45]Flash is the fastest guy in there, you need something done, he's on it. \n[46]What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything. \n[47]Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash! Buddy, it's nice to see ya. \n[48]Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten your name. \n[49]Hang in there. \n[50]Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke? \n[51]What do you call a three humped camel? \n[52]Pregnant. \n[53]Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya. \n[54]Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer. \n[55]Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation. \n[56]Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him. \n[57]It does. One hundred percent. Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done? \n[58]Hey! \n[59]First off, you throw like a bunny, second, you're a very sore loser. See ya later, Officer Fluff, so sad this is over, I wish I could've helped more. \n[60]\n[61]The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! But on CD? Who still uses CDs? \n[62]Carrots...? If your otter was here... he had a very bad day. \n[63]No. \n[64]Well, now wait a minute... Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music... fancy cup... I know whose car this is. We gotta go! \n[65]The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

And, is that Kevin?! Long time no see. And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me? Huh? For old time's sake? \n[68]That's a no. \n[69]I uh, I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug... that was made from the fur of a... skunk's butt. \n[70]No. \n[71]No. \n[72]Stop talking stop talking stop talking-- \n[73]Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder- \n[74]This is a simple misunderstanding. \n[75]Well actually we were brought here against our will, so... Point is, I did not know it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding. \n[76]Mime! She is a mime. This mime, cannot speak. You can't speak if you're a mime. \n[77]Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm not saying nothing-- \n[78]Please! No no no! If you're mad at me about the rug I've got more rugs! \n[79]Whoa. A teensy otter... did that? \n[80]Oh. So you know about the night howlers too? Good, good, good. Because the night howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about. Right? \n[81]Buddy? \n[82]What is wrong with him?! \n[83]It's Tujunga! \n[84]Get in! Carrots? Carrots! \n[85]No, no, no! \n[86]Buddy, one predator to another--                      * \n[87]Now, I can tell you're a little tense, so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space-- \n[88]Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go! \n[89]No, you what? No, I said-- listen-- noooo! \n[90]Carrots. You saved my life. \n[91]Uh, no. \n[92]Sorry, what I said was, \"no.\" She will not be giving you that badge. Look, you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, no wonder she needed to get help from a fox, none of you guys were gonna help her, were you? \n[93]Here's the thing Chief, you gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have 10 left to find our Mr. Otterton... and that's exactly what we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse us... we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack. Good day. \n[94]Officer Hopps? \n[95]Never let `em see that they get to you. \n[96]No... I mean, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once. \n[97]No, it's true. I think was 8, or maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts. \n[98]...so, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform because, by God, I was gonna fit in. \n[99]Even if I was the only predator in the troop-- \n[100]I was gonna be part of a pack. \n[101]I was so proud. \n[102]I learned two things that day. One, I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me. \n[103]If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there's no point in trying to be anything else. \n[104]Boy, look at that traffic down there. How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams? \n[105]The Jam Cams...! \n[106]No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy. Whatever happened to that jaguar-- \n[107]Bingo! \n[108]However. If you didn't have access to the system before, I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now. \n[109]So fluffy! \n[110]Sheep never let me this close. \n[111]You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself? \n[112]Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums. \n[113]Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna howl. \n[114]And there it is. What is it with wolves and the howling? It's like-- \n[115]...I bet they took Otterton too. \n[116]You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal-- which I never have-- I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B... which would put them out... \n[117]...right there. \n[118]How dare you. \n[119]Acacia alley... Ficus underpass... South Canyon... \n[120]You are a clever bunny. \n[121]You know, after you, you're the cop. \n[122]Okay. All clear. \n[123]Carrots...? \n[124]Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I mean, what kind of-- \n[125]Or not. Guess he's in no rush to get home to the Missus. \n[126]Great! We're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead. \n[127]What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why? \n[128]Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?! \n[129]Okay, press conference 101: You wanna look smart? \n[130]Answer their question with your own question and then answer that question. Like this, \"Excuse me. Officer Hopps, what can you tell us about the case?\" \"Well, was this a tough case? Yes. Yes it was.\" You see? \n[131]Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not. \n[132]Oh, I think you said plenty. \n[133]Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious? \n[134]Right. But a fox could? Huh? \n[135]Oh, there's a them now? \n[136]The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent? \n[137]Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? Do you think I might go nuts? Do you think I might go savage? Do you think I might try to... EAT YOU?! \n[138]...I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me... \n[139]Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. \n[140]Wow. Isn't that interesting. \n[141]Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours. \n[142]Alright, get in here. \n[143]Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so emotional. There we go. Deep breath. Are you just trying to steal the pen. Is that what this is? You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off, off. \n[144]I thought you guys only grew carrots. What's the plan? \n[145]Okay. How? \n[146]Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody. \n[147]Well, well, look who it is. The duke of bootleg. \n[148]Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered the market on night howlers... \n[149]Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get back here! What are you doing?! He's gonna see you! What are you looking at? Hey! Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it. Carrots! Carrots! \n[150]What are you doing?! You just trapped us in here! \n[151]Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it. \n[152]Wait, what? \n[153]Great, you're a conductor now? Hey, listen-- It would take a miracle to get this rust-bucket going. \n[154]Well... Hallelujah! \n[155]Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot? \n[156]Well, I can cross that off the bucket list. \n[157]I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot. \n[158]Maybe that's just hail? \n[159]Back off! \n[160]Incoming! \n[161]Carrots?! \n[162]There's another train coming! \n[163]Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast! Hold on! \n[164]I think this is our stop! \n[165]Yeah. Oh, except for this. \n[166]Ow. \n[167]Ah Carrots! \n[168]I got ya, come here, come here. \n[169]Okay, now just relax. \n[170]Whoops... Blueberry? \n[171]I'm not gonna leave you behind.
