{"dialogues": {"GRAHAM": "\n[1]Bo where's Morgan? \n[2]Bo? \n[3]This isn't a -- \n[4]Morgan what's happening? \n[5]Are... you... hurt? \n[6]Did what Morgan? \n[7]... Lee actually the reason I'm calling is about Lionel. \n[8]Was he at home last night with you or was he out and about with the Wolfington brothers? \n[9]Well, there was a little mischief done to our crops last night. \n[10]I know he's a fine boy... No one's saying otherwise. \n[11]Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it was him.  You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me... See it was kind of strange finding the crops like that.  The kids were... confused by it.  It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the Wolfington brothers just messing around... The movies... Are you sure? Okay, then... Thank you for your patience Lee. \n[12]Take him outside.  I'll call Dr. Reynolds. \n[13]That was quick Edgar.  I only called you boys about two hours ago. \n[14]Don't call me Father. \n[15]Don't call me Father.  It's just Graham now. \n[16]You said something was strange. What's strange? \n[17]What about them? \n[18]It's not broken. \n[19]Can't be by hand... It's too perfect. \n[20]What was the first thing? \n[21]Sounds like a virus. \n[22]Edgar, please don't call me Father. \n[23]I don't hear my children. \n[24]Did he hurt you? \n[25]I'm so sorry Morgan. \n[26]Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed.  Make sure the knot's tight. \n[27]They're tough cookies, those two. They think Houdini's playing with you up there. At least it got them to sleep. \n[28]Okay Miss Puzzle Master.  I got one for you... What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field... and what would scare every animal in this county? Have you figured it out yet? You probably have... Give me a hint Colleen... Is it bigger than a bread box? \n[29]What's the matter? \n[30]What's wrong with the water next to your bed? \n[31]What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night? \n[32]Right. \n[33]What are you thinking about? \n[34]It makes me feel better. \n[35]No. \n[36]This is not an intelligent way to approach this. \n[37]Explain, act crazy? \n[38]I'm not going to curse. \n[39]It doesn't sound natural when I curse. \n[40]Explain noises. \n[41]No I'm not. \n[42]Ahhhh... I'm insane with anger. \n[43]I've lost my mind!  It's time for an ass whoopin'! \n[44]I cursed. \n[45]He's on the roof. \n[46]Yes it was. \n[47]It does seem kind of odd doesn't it? \n[48]He definitely wasn't a midget. \n[49]I would say so. \n[50]Yes, it was. \n[51]Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it.  But we couldn't see him.  He stayed mostly in the shadows.  All we could make out was movement. But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty.  There was someone watching our house last night.  He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar. I need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is something serious. \n[52]Yes. \n[53]Edgar, come inside. \n[54]I have some upstairs. \n[55]Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves? \n[56]He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high. \n[57]Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I have double A's in here. \n[58]I know you're making a point Edgar. I just don't know what it is. \n[59]Bo, you're too old to still be doing this.  The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. Now what's wrong with this one? \n[60]This one? \n[61]This one? \n[62]I don't think so. \n[63]No. \n[64]No. \n[65]It's old Morgan. \n[66]Turn up the volume Bo. \n[67]Six months. \n[68]And three weeks. \n[69]It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me. \n[70]No radio either... Just for a while. \n[71]Only one. \n[72]Meet back in fifteen minutes. \n[73]For Morgan Hess.  And it's not Father anymore. \n[74]Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a -- reverend -- anymore.  I haven't been for six months.  You know this. \n[75]I suppose it's in its usage. \n[76]That's a curse. \n[77]I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone.  Is that understood? \n[78]It's just static Morgan.  Turn it up and see. \n[79]Let me see that please. \n[80]It's broken Morgan.  It'll just keep doing this. Let's get out of the car okay? \n[81]We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this. \n[82]I'm getting out now. \n[83]It's probably picking up another baby monitor. \n[84]See this is why we're not watching those news reports.  People get obsessed. I'm letting go now. \n[85]Morgan? \n[86]Morgan, be careful. \n[87]Hold on. \n[88]Merrill you got her. \n[89]You know something?  Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting. \n[90]I can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing. \n[91]It's a kind of faith.  It's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see. \n[92]You were always good at that... \n[93]Believing in things you couldn't see. You would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor. \n[94]It'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be -- all just make believe. \n[95]You're wasting your time here!  I'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or anybody!  You're not going to get famous! \n[96]Okay. Let's turn on the TV. \n[97]Find another tape. \n[98]That's true. \n[99]Yes. \n[100]That wasn't the answer you wanted? \n[101]... There are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. You see signs.  Sometimes they're little ones.  You think of someone. The phone rings.  They're on the phone... Sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over Mexico City. Sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing.  But there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle.  A sign of God's existence.  It's all in how you look at things Merrill. What you have to decide is what kind of person you are?  Are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance? \n[102]There you go. \n[103]Do you feel comforted? \n[104]What does it matter then? \n[105]Do you know what Colleen's last words were before they killed her? \n[106]She said, \"See\", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... \"Tell Merrill to swing away.\" \n[107]Do you know why she said that? \n[108]Because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head. There is no one watching out for us Merrill.  We're all on our own. \n[109]What's furry, furry rabbit? \n[110]What time is it? \n[111]The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell. \n[112]Oh. \n[113]Who wrote this book? \n[114]That means they're unemployed. \n[115]I don't know what got into me. \n[116]Bimboo? \n[117]I just asked his name. \n[118]Looks a little like our house doesn't it? \n[119]That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.  Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or something. \n[120]Hello? \n[121]I'm going out for a few minutes. No one leaves this house.  No one. \n[122]Ray Reddy's house. \n[123]I think he just called here. \n[124]Hello Ray. \n[125]What happened Ray? \n[126]You're welcome Ray. \n[127]Where you going Ray? \n[128]Ray, did you see one of them? \n[129]Hello. \n[130]The police are here... I am with them... I am a police officer. I just want to talk to you. \n[131]We know all about the hoax.  We already took some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon. Paddy wagon? \n[132]If you tell us your name and why you did it, we'll give you the same deal we gave the others.  Don't throw away your life son. \n[133]Douche bag. \n[134]Tell me something Morgan.  In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile? \n[135]Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade? \n[136]What's two? \n[137]What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something? \n[138]We can choose to believe it and pack up and leave. Or we can stay here.  Board up this house.  Hide inside our home and wait it out.  Either way, at least we'll be together. All those in favor of the lake, raise your hand. \n[139]All those in favor of home, raise your hand. \n[140]Because, they seem to have trouble with pantry doors. \n[141]They decided to show themselves. \n[142]I'm going to get back to the windows. \n[143]We'll have to board up the bedroom doors. \n[144]The family room. \n[145]We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner. \n[146]Spaghetti sounds great. \n[147]What do you want, Morgan? \n[148]Now we're talking. How about you Merrill? \n[149]Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon. \n[150]What's the matter with everyone? Eat. \n[151]I don't want to hear anymore talk like that.  And I don't want to see anymore faces like the ones I'm looking at. We are going to enjoy this meal. Nothing can stop us from enjoying this meal!  Enjoy! \n[152]Stop crying! \n[153]Fine, if you all don't want to eat, then I'm going to have some of everything. \n[154]This tastes so great. \n[155]It's happening. \n[156]Did I ever tell you what everyone said when you were born, Bo? \n[157]You came out of your momma and you didn't even cry.  You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody.  Your eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped. \n[158]They literally gasped. Then they go, \"She's like an angel.\"  They said, \"We've never seen a baby so beautiful.\" \n[159]And you know what else happened? \n[160]When they put you on the table to clean you up, you looked at me and smiled.  They say babies that young can't smile... You smiled. \n[161]Let's go down now. \n[162]They already know we're here. \n[163]Do you know what happened when you were born Morgan? \n[164]You came out and your momma kept bleeding.  The doctors rushed you out of the room before I could even see you. \n[165]While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you. \n[166]I wanted your momma to see you first.  She had dreamed about you her whole life. They waited till she felt better, then they brought you in.  They placed you right in her arms.  And she looked at you.  And you looked at her.  You just stared at each other for the longest time and then she said real soft, \"Hello Morgan, I'm you momma, you look just like I dreamed.\" \n[167]How temporary? \n[168]Let go. \n[169]We have to go in the basement. \n[170]Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm? \n[171]They're right behind the door. \n[172]He was only a year and half old. \n[173]He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.  Your grandma said, \"No.\"  He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it. \n[174]I must have pulled his arm at an awkward angle.  His elbow popped right out of the socket. \n[175]He didn't scream or anything.  His arm just flopped to his side and he got real still. \n[176]I held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital. I couldn't stop crying... We need to go into the basement now. \n[177]You know what your Uncle Merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place?  He jumped off the table and gave me a hug.  He had already forgotten that I was the one who hurt him. \n[178]I'm sorry I hurt your arm. \n[179]We need something to wedge against the doorknob. \n[180]You're scaring your sister. \n[181]Merrill -- \n[182]Merrill! \n[183]Where's Bo? \n[184]I can't even imagine. \n[185]They're just making noises. They're not trying to get in. Why are they doing that? \n[186]They're distracting us? \n[187]Morgan, give me your flashlight. \n[188]Is there an air vent in here? \n[189]I can feel air. \n[190]It's getting stronger. \n[191]Pull him! \n[192]We don't have his medicine. \n[193]Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow it down together.  Feel my chest. Feel it going in and out.  Breathe like me.  Breathe like me. \n[194]Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I know it hurts.  Be strong baby... It'll pass. \n[195]Don't do this to me again.  Not again. \n[196]I hate you.  I hate you... \n[197]The fear is feeding it... Don't be afraid of what's happening... Believe it's going to pass... Believe it... Just wait... Don't be afraid... The air is coming... Believe... We don't have to be afraid... It's about to pass... Here it comes... Don't be afraid... Here comes the air... \n[198]There we go... We don't have to be scared at all... We know it'll pass.  We believe it... Don't be afraid Morgan. \n[199]Feel my chest... Breathe with me. Together... The air is going in our lungs... Together... We're the same.  We're the same. \n[200]I hate you. \n[201]They're broadcasting... \n[202]How many died? \n[203]How do they know it's over? \n[204]No. \n[205]Okay. \n[206]Have they said anything about our area? \n[207]He's not strong enough to fight off another attack. \n[208]Me too. \n[209]Get the syringe as well.  We might need to give him an epinephrine shot. \n[210]You want to see it? \n[211]I'll bring the TV in here. \n[212]He's reading my -- \n[213]There was an accident.  Drunk driving.  They weren't sure. \n[214]Is he okay? \n[215]She's talking... Which ambulance is she in? \n[216]Why not? \n[217]Pinned?  What does that mean? \n[218]What did you say? \n[219]Edgar. Is this the last time I'm going to talk to my wife? \n[220]Hi baby. \n[221]You love walks. \n[222]Does it hurt? \n[223]Good. \n[224]... I will. \n[225]... I will. \n[226]I'm here. \n[227]What? Colleen?... Colleen? \n[228]Swing away, Merrill. \n[229]Merrill. \n[230]Swing away. \n[231]His lungs were closed. His lungs were closed.  No poison got in... No poison got in. \n[232]His lungs were closed. \n[233]Don't touch him. \n[234]Don't touch him. \n[235]Don't. \n[236]Yeah baby.  I think someone did. ", "MERRILL": "\n[1]Where are they? \n[2]I used a little Tabasco in the potato salad. \n[3]Okay, this guy is trying to scare us.  He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house.  It's time for an ass whoopin'! \n[4]We both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions. We act crazy, insane with anger. Make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side. \n[5]Curse and stuff. \n[6]You don't mean it.  It's just for show. \n[7]Just make noises then. \n[8]Are you going to do this or what? \n[9]You want him coming in the house next time? \n[10]On the count of three. One... two... three. \n[11]We're gonna beat your ass bitch! \n[12]I'm gonna tear your head off! \n[13]I heard. \n[14]It was very dark. \n[15]Probably. \n[16]It was very dark. \n[17]I don't know any girls can run like that. \n[18]This guy got on the roof in like a second. \n[19]That roof is over ten feet high. \n[20]Excluding the possibility that a female Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility? \n[21]No. \n[22]Listen, I was out of line with that whole female Scandinavian Olympian thing. \n[23]It's just that, I'm pretty strong and pretty fast.  And I was running as fast as I could.  And this guy... He was just toying with us. \n[24]You do? \n[25]I see. \n[26]Clear for what? \n[27]You have a pamphlet or something I can read? \n[28]I got the bat at home... On the wall. \n[29]Five.  The five longest. \n[30]Hello Lionel. \n[31]Felt wrong not to swing. \n[32]Pharmacy crowded? \n[33]Yeah. \n[34]All this crop stuff.  They did it twenty-five years ago.  It was a joke. \n[35]It's noise. \n[36]We'll look like mental patients. \n[37]That's right. \n[38]Let me see it. \n[39]You'll lose the signal! \n[40]I got him. \n[41]The crazies were right. \n[42]Some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world. \n[43]Do you think it's a possibility? \n[44]How can you say that? \n[45]Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be?  Give me some comfort? \n[46]I was at this party once.  I'm on a couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me.  I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in my mouth.  I turn and take out the gum.  Stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around.  Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. I knew the second it happened.  It was a miracle.  I could have been kissing her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life.  I may never have recovered. \n[47]I'm a miracle man.  Those lights are a miracle. \n[48]So which type are you? \n[49]Yes. \n[50]For the kids protection.  All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m.  I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right? \n[51]That's a game isn't it? Anyway... There's been some interesting developments. \n[52]Eleven a.m.  They're gone. \n[53]But they're not really gone.  We just can't see them.  Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night. \n[54]It stopped dead in the air and fell straight down. \n[55]They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning.  They found the bird.  His head crushed in.  When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion. \n[56]Already thought of.  Two other birds did the same thing an hour later.  Not as dramatic.  They lived.  But you could see they hit something. \n[57]They're still there hovering.  In fact, some people think there's more of them now.  All over the place.  Over us even. And there's a theory about the crop circles now.  They think it could be some kind of landmark, visual mapping system -- so they can navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense doesn't it? \n[58]You had a tone. \n[59]Where are you going? \n[60]Why? \n[61]Move children!  Vamonos! \n[62]They're skin changes color.  That's why we couldn't see him that night. \n[63]I'm sorry, what book is this? \n[64]How do we know boards will do anything? \n[65]It's like War of the Worlds. \n[66]You guys okay? \n[67]Don't worry. \n[68]You know about signs Morgan?  Not like the ones people write on. It's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it.  Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled.  They're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you. \n[69]Yeah, like that. I believe in signs Morgan.  I think there's someone watching out for us.  I got to believe he's going to make sure we're all right in the end. \n[70]Too many windows in the bedrooms. We don't have enough boards. \n[71]I'll make sandwiches. \n[72]We should eat fast Bo. \n[73]Chicken Teriyaki. \n[74]Graham hurry. \n[75]Should we turn off the lights? \n[76]They're on the roof. \n[77]They're in the house. \n[78]The attic door. \n[79]This is a very temporary solution. \n[80]Twenty-two seconds. \n[81]This is going to do nothing. \n[82]There's no way out of there. \n[83]Should we make a run for it out the back? \n[84]What are you doing? \n[85]They're coming. \n[86]We won't be able to get out of there. \n[87]I know. \n[88]I'm looking! \n[89]Got it! \n[90]What's happening out there? \n[91]They want our attention on the door? \n[92]From what? \n[93]What book! \n[94]Me too. \n[95]I'm close. \n[96]Hold the vent! \n[97]I should save the flashlights. \n[98]I found a pack of light bulbs. \n[99]It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up. We won Graham. \n[100]It went on all night.  Everywhere. It was completely a ground battle. Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see them unless you're up close.  A lot of people died.  Some from combat. But most from poison gas inhalation.  They secrete it. \n[101]They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates. But we held strong. \n[102]A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now. They're leaving. \n[103]You didn't think we'd make it. \n[104]Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother -- -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things.  I saw your eyes last night. I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay?  I'm serious. \n[105]He's been like that for awhile.  We need to get him some medicine. \n[106]Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure? \n[107]I know. We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham. \n[108]That's good enough for me. \n[109]Graham. \n[110]Graham. ", "MORGAN": "\n[1]I think God did it. \n[2]Houdini peed.  I think he's sick. \n[3]You don't even know what that word means. \n[4]It's not contaminated.  It's just tap water.  Pour it in his bowl. \n[5]He licks his butt everyday.  He's not going to mind. \n[6]Houdini? \n[7]Bo don't run. \n[8]What's wrong boy? \n[9]Stop it Houdini! \n[10]Bo, run. \n[11]He wanted to kill Bo. \n[12]Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie? \n[13]It needs batteries. \n[14]These are D's; I need double A's. \n[15]It's still making the noises.  It's broken. \n[16]Extraterrestrials. \n[17]Book money. \n[18]Extraterrestrials? \n[19]Do you have book on extraterrestrials? \n[20]Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing about her drinking water.  She's had it her whole life.  Like a tick people have.  Except it's not a tick. \n[21]I'll take it. \n[22]Is that him? \n[23]He's the man who killed mom. \n[24]What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials? \n[25]It's a code. \n[26]We might lose the signal. \n[27]Don't do it. \n[28]Nobody move! \n[29]Voices.  Did you hear that? \n[30]Not English though.  You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill? \n[31]Stop! \n[32]It doesn't sound like words. \n[33]Don't do it! \n[34]Don't let go. \n[35]It gets clearer, the higher you hold it. \n[36]Stop! \n[37]There's two of them talking. \n[38]They hung up. \n[39]We have to tape this... \n[40]Listen Bo.  This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change.  The history of the world's future is on the TV right now.  We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there... For your children Bo. \n[41]Dad! \n[42]Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape. \n[43]Told you. \n[44]So the aliens can't read our minds. \n[45]They tell you everything in this book. \n[46]It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet. \n[47]Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs. \n[48]Dad, are you going to be serious? \n[49]There are pictures. \n[50]Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book -- \n[51]Dad. \n[52]He says there are two reasons why Extraterrestrials would visit us. \n[53]To make contact in the spirit of exploration and furthering the knowledge of the universe. \n[54]Or the other reason... They're hostile.  They've used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest our planet next. \n[55]That's weird. \n[56]Why, you got one of your feeling again? \n[57]Is it bad? \n[58]If it does, I won't let anything bad happen to you. \n[59]Who said I was going to die? \n[60]Who said I was going to die? \n[61]Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look out. \n[62]Yes.  They would invade us using only ground tactics.  Hand to hand combat.  They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them. \n[63]They said one of two things could happen.  One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later. \n[64]They win. \n[65]Sounds made up. \n[66]Come quick! \n[67]They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver. \n[68]They think it might happen all at once. \n[69]Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill? \n[70]You sure right? \n[71]I once had a bad dream and I couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and I woke up.  It was a picture of mom.  She was smiling. It made me feel safe... You mean like that? \n[72]Where are we going to sleep? \n[73]What about Isabelle? \n[74]Anything? \n[75]French toast... and mashed potatoes. \n[76]I'm scared. \n[77]Don't yell at her! \n[78]We forgot about Isabelle. \n[79]Dad -- \n[80]We forgot our foil helmets! \n[81]They'll read our minds! \n[82]They'll know our secret thoughts. \n[83]I hope they're doing better than we are.  We don't even have helmets. \n[84]The book says they're probably very good problem solvers. \n[85]They'll find a way in. \n[86]What? \n[87]Did someone save me? ", "OFFICER PASKI": "\n[1]Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as she put it, \"diving for her life\" when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thorton's store this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards.  Spitting! By the time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place... She must have had a cold or something.  It was enough to turn a grown man's stomach. \n[2]So what happened to your crops? \n[3]It's the strangest thing Father. \n[4]What's that? \n[5]Sorry. \n[6]The footprints. \n[7]There are none. \n[8]Look at where it's bent over. \n[9]What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it? \n[10]Doesn't sound much like Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.  They can't take a piss without wetting the front of their pants. \n[11]Second thing this week I can't explain. \n[12]Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior.  Sometimes violent behavior.  Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow. \n[13]No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything. \n[14]What's wrong? \n[15]You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd? \n[16]I don't know whether to look for a midget or a -- \n[17]Okay. So he was tall? \n[18]Over six feet? \n[19]We've established that. Just tell me about his clothing then. \n[20]Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or jeans? \n[21]Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around?  You said you went in opposite directions. \n[22]I apologize. \n[23]How certain are you, that this was a male? \n[24]I don't know Merrill.  I've seen some of those women on the Olympics.  They could out run me easy. \n[25]They got women's high jumping in the Olympics.  They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over me. \n[26]Yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a couple of customers.  No one's seen her since... My point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw.  We should just keep all possibilities available. \n[27]I'm not done asking questions and I don't appreciate the sarcasm. \n[28]Do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church? \n[29]Do you owe anybody money?  You can tell me off the record if you need too. \n[30]Is anything missing? \n[31]Could everyone just take a seat on the couch.  I have some preliminary thoughts. \n[32]There are three possibilities here. We'll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I really don't believe that's what we're looking at here.  In my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. That's kind of clear. The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very slim one. I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. He's a watcher.  Someone who this is a game for.  He's laying low. Doesn't want to be seen.  But he wants to watch you.  Study you folks. \n[33]Now I don't want you all to worry about this no more.  You're making more of this than it is. You guys have had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death of your shepherd. Maybe you guys should do something fun?  Let me worry about this person.  Let me find out who it is and then -- What the hell are you people looking at? \n[34]I'll be damned. \n[35]What in God's name is going on? \n[36]Don't ask me what I think.  Cause I can't think straight right now. I'm going back to the station. Have a cup of Marcia's coffee and try to think clear.  After that I might make some calls. Hoaxes... People got way too much time on their hands. \n[37]But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes.  You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago. \n[38]It's left its mark still.  The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world.  Take them into town.  Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things.  It's good medicine. \n[39]You take care of yourself... Graham. \n[40]What do you know? \n[41]He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell asleep at the wheel. \n[42]Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too. \n[43]She's not in an ambulance Father. \n[44]See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree.  She was pinned between the two. \n[45]The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half. \n[46]She won't be saved.  At this point she's alive, because the truck is holding her together.  She doesn't feel much, and she's talking almost like normal.  We didn't pull the truck out, cause we wanted you to come down here to be with her, as long as she's awake.  That won't be very long. Father, you understand what I've told you? \n[47]Yes it is.

They can't get you under the blankets. \n[12]Dad, where's the remote? \n[13]There's dust in it. \n[14]A hair. \n[15]Morgan took a sip.

It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy-two hours. \n[2]Mexico City officials as well as U.S. officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either government's airforce.  The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered Mexico City air space.  They were not detected by radar by either country. \n[3]... You're seeing a live feed from our NBC affiliate down in Mexico City.  The time there is 7:17pm. This image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way.  What you're seeing is real. Everything they wrote in science books is about to change. \n[4]... The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed by a forty-two year old Romero Valadares. \n[5]This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few minutes ago. All initial opinions are; this is genuine. \n[6]What you are about to see, may disturb you. \n[7]Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights.  There are lights in the skies over an estimated two hundred and seventy four cities.

Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like.  No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away. \n[3]It's called probing.  It's a military procedure.  You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things.  Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation.  Evaluate the level of danger.  Make sure things are all clear... \n[4]... For the rest of them. \n[5]Hey you didn't used to play baseball did you? \n[6]Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill Hess.
