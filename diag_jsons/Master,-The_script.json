All things he says he is. \n[36]Delicious... delicious \n[37]Ok? \n[38]You can't be... \n[39]I'm it's Commander, yes. \n[40]New York City thru the canal. You're seamen? \n[41]You're looking for work? \n[42]You said you were an able bodied seamen and you were looking for work? \n[43]Perhaps. \n[44]You were sedated with chloral hydrate and bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if your check your butt-hole you'll find it's all in working order Isn't that what all men are worried about in they surrender themselves. \n[45]You were acting very aggressive because you drank too much alcohol. \n[46]Yes I think you were. And I don't like strange boys jumping on my ship. \n[47]Why don't you just ask for work? Work can't be hard to find. \n[48]You can't work in your condition. \n[49]You're aberrated. \n[50]A wandering from the path The problems you have in your life (your appendix, your work, your need to batter your body with booze...) I resolve that they can be fixed. \n[51]Maybe I do, but not the kind you think. \n[52]A charter though the Explorer's Club. \n[53]I am many things. I am writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like you. \n[54]Many years of successful writing and publishing has made me self sufficient. Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my work - but now I'm retired to study the mid and the spirit...my life's true work. \n[55]These studies have made me a target and I am hunted for what I know. Which is why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know what your motives are? \n[56]Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How I miss the days of working a four mastered schooner with nothing but salt horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem so much more fragile, don't you think? You - you're and adventurer. \n[57]An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine, and a dashing mischievousness is what I knew would come to me in this-lifetime. .would you study with me? Submit yourself? \n[58]I am always looking for mature men of unusual ability who are willing to stretch the boundaries of what they know. To increase knowing-ness and communication amongst man. I need day-ta. And with your help, I can gather it... \n[59]You already understand, you just need to remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.' \n[60]What's-about-this?' \n[61]As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no idea the contents of this remarkable potion, what's in it. \n[62]Can you make more? \n[63]I'll grant you a full reprive from your naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us some more. I must admit I sampled some and ended up drinking it all. \n[64]Horrible Hooch? \n[65]Would you scrub yourself up and make yourself clean? My daughter is getting married. Come and join us and leave your worries for a while, they'll still be there when you get back..he he he. You are invited. \n[66]I think we have known each other before you and I - \n[67]It will come out over time, but yes. We are re-united... do you reember me? 24. \n[68]That's alright. Don't strain yourself. You will. There will be much time to discuss this on the journey to our destination. As we travel down Time- Holes...you won't be afraid will you? \n[69]Have you ever had harm cme to you? \n[70]What if we could return to a period of your life where there was harm and do away with it? .would You like that? \n[71]That's where we go. They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is welcome'd... MASTER finds his daughter, ELIZABETH, who is to be married and her husband-to-be CLARK  He introduces them to Freddie - \n[72].as long as you hold these bodies, in this life: you may kiss the bride. THEY KISS. APPLAUSE, CHEERS. CU. FREDDIE. He listens and watches. \n[73]Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE \n[74]Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays. So now he's got a leash on and he's staying on my command - THAT\"S WHAT WHERE WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on command. Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances; \n[75]Next we're gonna teach it to roll over and play DEAD. Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his days studying Judo ... FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the table is: VAL, strikes up conversation: \n[76]When can we have some of your potion? \n[77]When I'd like it - I will give you a signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my nose. What will you need? 27. \n[78]Enough! Enough! I must get back to work! Keep going! Dont stop all night long! He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it all. \n[79].someone came up to me the other day, and I had to say...I had to correct him. He said, \"I heard the Cause can fix me..\" I looked down at him and he'd lost his legs. He's sitting in a wheel chair and had no legs to speak of. I said, \"We can do very many things, sir...but no, we cannot replace your legs. This is how rumors get started.\" Let's talk about what we can do... FREDDIE looks around and watches all the STUDENTS on their headphones. He tries to flirt and make eye contact with all the WOMEN. \n[80]What's in it? \n[81]How are you feeling, Freddie? \n[82]Rested? \n[83]Excited? \n[84]Have you made some friends? \n[85]Good. Good. How are you feeling? \n[86]I've been writing ... BULAGH! Feel like I went under. Dark cloud rolls in. Opens up...anxious to share new work-would you care for some informal processing? \n[87]Well, then I gather myself... and you be my protege and guinea pig, eh? Informal processing. Master smiles, excited, moves to an OLD TAPE RECORDER, points a microphones towards Freddie, looks over some papers... \n[88]Are you ready? \n[89]Say your name. \n[90]Say it again. \n[91]Say it again. \n[92]Might as well say it one more time just to make sure you know who you are... \n[93]Do you ever make thoughtless remarks. \n[94]Do you browse though railway timetables just for pleasure? \n[95]Do you get occasional twitches of you muscles when there is no logical reason for it? \n[96]Do past failures bother you? \n[97]Do past failures bother you? \n[98]Do past failures bother you? \n[99]So past failures bother you? \n[100]Is your life a constant struggle for survival? \n[101]Would you rather give orders than take them? \n[102]Are you often impulsive in you behaviour. \n[103]Do other people interest you very much? \n[104]Do you find it easy to be impartial? \n[105]Are you likely to be jealous? \n[106]Are you logical and scientific in your thinking? \n[107]Do you rarely suspect the actions of others? \n[108]Yes you do. \n[109]Are you usually truthful to others? \n[110]Are your actions considered unpredictable by other people? HOLD. HOLD. Freddie seems to think about this questions seriously, THEN: OUT OF THE PAUSE AND OUT OF THE BLUE HE \n[111]Silly..its good to laugh in processing.. sometimes we forget. Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth: \n[112]\"Freddie Sutton, Test Session. May 5, 1952, 1800 hours. Aboard he sailing vessel Aletheia, en route to New York City. MOC logged ad approced.\" He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a comforting hug. \n[113]Should we sample another sip before we join them upstairs? \n[114]For now. \n[115]Could you answer the next series of questions without blinking your eyes? To without fear and hesitation answer as quickly as you can? \n[116]Look at me...Starting now you are not to blink. If you blink we go back to the \n[117]Infringement. Back to the start. You blink, we repeat from the start. Do you often ponder over your own inferiority? \n[118]Do you believe that God will save you from your own ridiculousness and self contempt? \n[119]Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family. \n[120]Have you ever had intercourse with a member of your family? \n[121].who? \n[122]Have you ever killed anyone? \n[123]Maybe? \n[124]Have you ever killed anyone. \n[125]How many times did you have intercourse with your aunt? \n[126]Where is your aunt now? \n[127]Where? 40. \n[128]Would you like to see her? \n[129]Would you like to sleep with her again? \n[130]Do you regret this? \n[131]What is she doing now? \n[132]Where is your mother? \n[133]INFRINGEMENT. Back to the start. \n[134]Do you often ponder your own inferiority? \n[135]Do you believe God is going to save you? 41. \n[136]Have you ever had sex with a member of your family? \n[137]Are you lying? \n[138]Who? \n[139]Where is your aunt? \n[140]Are you lying? \n[141]Are you a liar? \n[142]Have you ever killed anyone? \n[143]Who? \n[144]In the war? 42. \n[145]What are you running from? \n[146]The law? \n[147]Where? \n[148]Is the booze you make poison? \n[149]Are you trying to poison me? \n[150]Where is your father? \n[151]Where is your mother? \n[152]What is your Auntie's Name? 43. \n[153]How did you come to sleep with your Auntie Bertha? \n[154]And you did it again and again. \n[155]She's rich? Is she? She has your inheritance, does she? \n[156]You feel you're owed this? \n[157]Have you ever had any bad thoughts about her or Mary Sue? \n[158]What do you think? \n[159]If you could lock yourself in a house, a large mansion for the rest of your life: who would you like to be there with you? \n[160]Who is Doris? \n[161]She's in New Jersey, is she? \n[162]Why aren't you with Doris? \n[163]Why aren't you with her? \n[164]Do you love Doris? \n[165]Is she the love of your life? \n[166]Close your eyes/ \n[167]Release and return to me ... Say your name. \n[168]Are you hear with me in 1952? 45. \n[169]End of session. Open/close your eyes. \n[170]How does it feel? Freddie laughs a little. \n[171]Left side of your body feels ok? \n[172]Right side? \n[173]Any headaches? \n[174]Are you a member of the Ninth Battle Batallion? \n[175]Are you a member of the Ninth Battle Batallion? \n[176]Or any other invader force? Space stations or communication depots on this planet or anywhere else? 46. \n[177]You're the bravest boy I've ever met. Master turns off the tape recorder. They DRINK DOWN THE BOOZE TOGETHER. Smile, laugh. \n[178]Thank you, Bill, good to see you. BILL leads the way, waves his hand to the show: \n[179]Loooooooooook at that... 1940 Harley Davidson Knucklehead. For me? 47. He slides on, starts it up, everyone APPLAUDS. MASTER TEARS AWAY ON THE MOTORCYCLE, everyone else [piles into some OLD SEDAN'S driven by some New York Followers -- Everyone on deck of the ship waves good-bye and watches them go. \n[180]You can hear a tomato scream when you cut it...this is why I don't eat tomatoes... \n[181]As you can see I've brought props. Everyone laughs. \n[182]Showman's trade secrets.. .he-he-he More laughter. \n[183]Let me just listen to this tape... He picks up the tape and lifts it to his ear..he wiggles it around next to his ear.. \n[184]Can't hear anything. But there's sound on here, no? Sound to be found? He puts the tape reels onto the player... 49. \n[185]This should do it! He flips the switch. Nothing. No sound. \n[186]Hmmmm. Can' thear anything. Wait. There are sounds on this tape, but I can't hear... wait... how about this... Nothing. He continues this ...he plugs the speakers in.. . nothing again and again. \n[187]Well what do we have? We have the high fidelity audio tape, we have speakers, and yet..a ha! Just a moment. He turns the machine \"ON\"... \n[188]This should do it... Nothing. \n[189]Seems we're out of pieces.. Everyone laughs nervously... \n[190]I know there's sound on that tape... He plugs the power cord into the wall... It crackles and sound pours out.. It's MASTER'S VOICE. \n[191]Everything's there isn't it? On the tape? Sure is, we just need to get it working with all the other pieces in synch-ro- nization. No good if it's not plugged into the wall. Can't hear it. But the sounds are still there. No good if those speakers aren't there. Can't hear it. 50. \n[192]But that doesn't mean it's not there, does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy little piece of tape is just nothin' without all the other equipment lined up properly, isn't it? We CAN access the past, traumas and seeds that abberate us in present time and once we access them - we challenge them and throw them away. Previously, I'd established how to access these aberrations and painful memories to pre-birth/cellular times. But the new studies prove there is a time beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which we are now working. At last count, perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our studies show... Besides the everyday struggles of how we become better, more able, more productive homo sapiens, the uses for this new science is the location and removal of certain leukemias, apathies, manics. Depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas. This is the province and science of Cause. If you'll forgive me, I must sit down. Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg injury and limp damndest thing. You see it happens every time I come to Manhattan Island, its a wound I've never conquered and I'll tell you how I found out about, because I never knew what in the H was happening... Well I did some processing to find out. Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me back...we processed over three hours! And something came up. It was this: I lived a life before and suffered a great injury. Knee injury... It was just around 1888. A great number and year. Significant as the creation . year of the new york city sewer system if I'm not wrong... I was a thief and criminal, working late into the night robbing a bank in the western side of the island. 51. \n[193]The crime was committed with a revolver in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I made it clear across town when we were ambushed by the local authorities. -- but I made a slip away. A digression into the under constructed sewer system. It was here that I could no be found - or so my thinking went. All my confidence and all my arrogance was brought upon me. Full in the face. For I was nose to nose with a twenty-five foot alligator in the New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a scare I was in for. Now if you've veer seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR - you'll remember the fear. You see, this being an island, and in those days more inhabited by creature than man, why wouldn't I meet such a beast? In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented drain hole just around 125th Street... present day Harlem County I believe today. Yes. Yes. I stuffed it and made a getaway from both man and beast \u00e2\u0080\u009eshattered my knee in five different places-turned into a piece of glass..woke up early in the morning somewhere near the present day Times Square-which was nothing more than a farm..quite a farm..but that's another story. So what does this say? Injuries stay with us don't they??..They sure do. How's it gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna fix this knee. How are any of us going to get better? More able? We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is not enough. We have Lived Many, Many, Many Lives. So anybody tat is not processing the whole of time - is doing a disservice to man and Will Not Get Better. I cannot put it more simply. 52. \n[194]And as for me now: I just need to find the time away from all of my writing to go back down and DO IT so I don't walk around with the darndest limp everytime I come to town! This story is greeted. with equal parts excitement/complete CONFUSION. MRS. PURCELL slightly nervous. \n[195]What is your name? \n[196]Are you sure you haven't lived here before? \n[197]What's your name? \n[198]Are you sure? \n[199]Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ. \n[200]Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible  why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees. \n[201]No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that. \n[202]That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours. \n[203]Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results. \n[204]Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it. \n[205]We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions. \n[206]No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to \n[207]I not only think it can, I know it does. \n[208]Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching - \n[209]T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization. \n[210]\n[211]\n[212]\n[213]\n[214]\n[215]\n[216]\n[217]\n[218]\n[219].this city is just noise. Just noise and bad living. I know this place. I know it's rotten secrets... CU. FREDDIE listening. He sips some of his booze form the FLASK, gets a real surly look on his face... .VAL gets up and leaves the hotel room... FRED DIE watches him go... Everyone seems resigned, sleepy...Freddie snaps and says \n[220]What is it? \n[221]This isn't the way...you heard me say to attack and you attacked? \n[222]\n[223]My little Soldier.. .what did you do?... . you need to tell me so that I know... 65. \n[224]But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy. Ok? Alright. Freddie: You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you are! The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE: \n[225]How are you...? How do you feel to be so close to your Auntie - just across the river? Close to the incident of this present time? \n[226]Your problems aren't with your auntie or your mommy or daddy or any such things. \n[227]You have seeded aberrations in this way. Absolute rejection of authority and nay- sayers. \n[228]Don't act out. This anger and battle has been there from before you remember. Before you know. It's not you, Freddie. It's not...I promise you. Freddie takes it all in. \n[229]It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of years ago - little implants.. BEAT. He pulls back, smiles... \n[230]I promise to explain it. And make it go away. MASTER collects his notebooks. \n[231]Val has a habit of finding trouble... I sometimes wonder what danger a man could get himself into this Island. \n[232]Can you do this for me? With a casualness and delicacy? Watchful eyes to make sure trouble doesn't come... or that come doesn't trouble? My little soldier? \n[233]And report back to me... \n[234]THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not out. Not Dead Yet! he he he he. 69. We are going to focus this morning to \"Communication\" to cover \"any exchange between ourselves and our environment.\" Because that's what I want to talk to you about today: dominating your environment. \n[235]You are very right about one thing, Helen: this is a dirty city of nothing good. MASTER thinks ... . Everyone looks around at each other ...A WOMAN STARTS SINGING... \n[236]Get thee behind me -- \n[237]Cheers to that! Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates: 79. \n[238]Something that Joseph Smith had right: the breeding and the development of the group... doubled, tripled with certain. ..a certain marital structure... how clever. Something to look at deeply for a growth... MARY SUE looks at him. JOAN looks at him. HELEN looks at him. FREDDIE looks at all of it. Helen's husband John looks confused. \n[239].the consideration of Celestial Marriage. Spiritual Wifery. Plural Unions. These cannot be overlooked so quickly... think of the speed at which a movement could grow... BEAT. Met with a strange silence. MARY SUE moves to get up. . .MASTER changes the topic slightly... \n[240]To live in the days of six-shooters and open frontier, that's what I'd like! My grandfather. Rancher. Wyoming. A criminal of the highest lineage, once told me he met a boy named Buckskin Joe... He keeps talking... \n[241]Yes. Yes. \n[242]Yes, master. \n[243]Yes master. He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her hands and walks out of the bathroom. \n[244]Try to recall how you feel... \n[245]What happens next? \n[246]What is the doctor wearing? \n[247]Is there a smell in the room?. 81. \n[248]Try to imagine what a hospital smells like. \n[249]What does the doctor say? \n[250]What is happening here? \n[251]Yes I Am. 83. \n[252]What are the charges? \n[253]This is a silly joke, no? \n[254]This is comic opera. Is it illegal in this city to get better? \n[255]I have no disagreement with you boys doing your work in all its silliness as defenders of what code? What honor? What part of the galaxy? This is a scientific gathering - you will cuff me from the front, if you please -- He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD \n[256]Freddie, no, no, no, calm down, please, please. It's nothing, just laugh, we'll be out shortly, it's nothing. I, please, pleasue, Freddie - \n[257]Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear; \n[258]Whatever we say is undoubtably being monitored...speak in whispers. \n[259]This is FBI work, Russians maybe... this... too much work for the \n[260]You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago. An Invader Force played games with your spirit as it.moved from one body to the next - free for a moment - it was free and the invader force captured it - spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses - quaver bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order, \n[261]I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you facts. \n[262]ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK. You CACTUS. Play a game with me? I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That ain't the way. You want to shut me up? I'm the best and only friend you have, shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU. ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You wanna get rid of this or live this way or MASTER it? 86. \n[263]You listen - you wanna spit in that cops face for touching you? I'm gonna beat him with you. Bash his skull in. BUT DON'T \n[264]Sex is not an aberration. Never has been. So what's wrong? \n[265]When did you forget that surviving was what you're supposed to do. Stick it in. Stick it in. \n[266]You belong at sea. \n[267].You belong to Doris. \n[268]You think of Doris. The loss of her. Triggers millions of little shocks and. charges, doesn't it? That present-life loss. \n[269]His mother was a paranoid schizophrenic who wanted to abort him. Right now he 'wants to be sick.' He's losing his war. \n[270]There is a mission against time to be undertaken, Freddie. \n[271]-- An assignment of importance in which more than just life hangs in the balance. \n[272]-- The drinking blocks the physical pain and dissolves treatment from working, \n[273]Freddie... there's something else...a side project I have for you... \n[274].When you get there...I need you to get something for me ... something of great importance to me. \n[275]When you arrive at the house ... you go underneath the house. There's a crawl space. In the center of the house is a small hole. You will see broken soil that marks the spot.. .dig it up. Inside is a box. I need you to take the box and protect it. You can take it to the First Phoenix Bank and register a safe deposit. There it can stay until my arrival... \n[276]Valuables. Personal and confidential to me ... \n[277]As Guardian of the Good for this civilization and all it's neighboring galaxies ... . can you promise me that you will safely deliver and protect this box? \n[278]Freddie. \n[279].Someone broke into the house... 93. \n[280]-- do you have the box? \n[281]Where are you now? \n[282]Is he there with you? \n[283]The box is safe in your hands? \n[284]You've done well. You know the severity of what you hold in your hands - \n[285]Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all we know. Certain atomic agencies wouldn't mind a crack at it, I'm sure. \n[286]Get yourself a room at the Sun Inn Motel. The Sun Inn Motel ...it's nearby... acceptable accommodations. \n[287]Find yourself a room there... and guard it until morning - stay safe until that bank opens... \n[288]Yes it is. Are you alright? \n[289]Why? \n[290]You feel any stomach pain? \n[291]Ringing in your ears? \n[292]Left side feels good? \n[293]Right side feel good? \n[294]Good, good. Alright, soldier. Go to it. FREDDIE hangs up and looks at the DUFFLE BAG.. .he looks his space... He looks at the Duffle Bag. \n[295]I'll need fresh ribbon tonight for the Old 'Vetti and paper, vanilla.
