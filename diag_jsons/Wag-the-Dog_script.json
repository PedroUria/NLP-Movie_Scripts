There is no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, \"Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program...\" \"What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?\"  \"If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested.\"  \"Deploy the B-2, Why?\"  \"In the Crisis.\" \n[29]I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried.

Wake me when we touch down, will... \n[45]We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the \"appearance\" of a war. \n[46]What's it gonna cost? \n[47]Who would find out? \n[48]The American \"people\"? \n[49]Who's gonna tell'em. \n[50]What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos. \n[51]...that's the general idea. \n[52]Why not, what've they ever done for us...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber... \n[53]Shifty.  Who knows anything about em... \n[54]Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know. \n[55]Well, I'm working on it.... \n[56]Yes. \n[57]What do you know about them? \n[58]Precisely. \n[59]What did they ever do for us...? You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber. \n[60]Here's what you got to do: Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There is no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A. \n[61]Well, I don't know, a lot of these early reports are inflated. \n[62]...who understands Human Nature? \n[63]...how can any of us know? \n[64]I'm sure that's the worst of it. \n[65]Well, it ain't over til it's over... \n[66]How's he doing? \n[67]We have some mutual friends in Washington. \n[68]I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party. \n[69]What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action. \n[70]If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we... \n[71]What do you want the kid to say? \n[72]String a few together.  All I need's eleven, \n[73]What do you think would hold it off? \n[74]I'm gonna tell you why... \n[75]Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does that mean? \n[76]Remember the Maine... \n[77]Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too! \n[78]We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking wars.  Y'know why.  Cause it's show business. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here. \n[79]It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing. You get the Actors get up there, and strut and Posture.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. \n[80]Why not? \n[81]Who? \n[82]\"They Got To Know?\"  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one \"Smart Bomb\" falling into a building. The truth, I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building. \n[83]How the fuck do we know.  You take my point? \n[84]It's not \"war.\"  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant... Like the Oscars... why we came to you... \n[85]N'it's a crying shame.  But you staged the Oscars... \n[86]And if you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... \n[87]Well, no, well, you couldn't tell any... \n[88]...that's what it is. \n[89]It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. \n[90]Because. \n[91]I'm sure they do. \n[92]\"Freedom.\" \n[93]...who is this guy...? \n[94]We don't need an Act Two. \n[95]We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election. \n[96]It's a teaser, absolutely right, \n[97]You can't have a war without an enemy. \n[98]Well, you could have one, but it'd be a very ineffective war... We're done in 10 days... \n[99]W...what? \n[100]\"Back End\" ... count on it. \n[101]It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon... \n[102]The Hostages...? \n[103]In the yellow ribbon. \n[104]The Ribbon Manufacturers. \n[105]I gotta protect the Canadian Horder, \n[106]Here's what we want to do:  The Park Police, the Border Patrol, and the US Marshall's Service.  The D.E. the A.T.F, all of em, Stand by for instant mobilization, 'long the Canadian Border. And tell 'em there's nothing to be alarmed about. \n[107]...what is this? \n[108]Young-Albanian-girl-driven-from-her-home. \n[109]Three-o-three... \n[110]\"If One Twinkie is Funny, Two Twinkies are Funnier...\" \n[111]Would somebody wake me in five minutes? \n[112]We're locked into Albania. \n[113]The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour. \n[114]Eh, Trudy, could I talk to you for a moment...?  You know, this project is a... \"Funny\" kind of... \n[115]Actually, no. \n[116]...someone would come to your house and kill you. Hello... we're about to start shooting... \n[117]We'll be back tonight. \n[118]Waal, that's where you want em... \n[119]Go with a two-tone hat, I don't care, you work it out.

Good.  What time tonight... What...? \n[124]Why is this putz on the air... \n[125]Why am I seeing this guy on the News...? What am I missing...?  What are we forgetting? \n[126]Can't find anything in here about the President and that girlscout. \n[127]...take a long view. \n[128]Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days. \n[129]Wilfred.

The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some Harvest Festival, something... \n[138]...got to be something.  She gives him the sacred... And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is... \n[139]Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says... \n[140]Yes:  she is saying this in Albanian, but she's doing it not to be uh... But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional... \n[141]C'n I get something to eat...?  Now the Old Broad starts to speak:  you are bringing peace.  Not only to This Land... \n[142]...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child... \n[143]Now, the Old Lady starts to Weep, Big Bird shrugs off his secret Service, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat. \n[144]So forth... \n[145]How is Big Bird holding up, by the way? \n[146]Knock on wood. \n[147]I dunno.... Ambassador to Togo, somethin', I dunno... he... \n[148]Yeah...what was I talking about...? \n[149]Due in Nashville. \n[150]We're gonna do the Team Song. \n[151]Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does Moss want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done. Now, Look:  I got the file, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how... \n[152]...Stanley Moss... \n[153]None of these are ours.  None of em are ours.... ....that's real politik, Buddy. \n[154]Feel free to talk to me. \n[155]...I just missed my plane. \n[156]Well, keep your wits about you, and let's see if we can't... \n[157]...brazen-it-through... \n[158]\n[159]My name is Ronald Brean. \n[160]Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you. \n[161]S'only got to hold for another few days. \n[162]What are you interested in? \n[163]Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job. \n[164]I'm doing my job, Too. Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute. \n[165]Thank you. \n[166]I have a question for you. \n[167]Why do people go to war? \n[168]Why do they go to War? \n[169]Would you go to War to do that? \n[170]Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your \"ability to fight a Two-ocean War\" against who?  Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street. And you can call this a \"drill,\" or you can call it \"job security,\" or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, \"Go to War to protect your Way of Life,\"  well, Chuck, this is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours. \n[171]It's just for eight more days..... \n[172]One more thing, what is that river she's running across? \n[173]...the young girl in the video, the Albanian Girl.... \n[174]...she's running, it's some sacred... some ancestral land, cloven by the Brook named.... give it to Moss, \n[175]Thank you. \n[176]I should be in Nashville, tell him I'm coming in. \n[177]\n[178]...they just hadn't thought it through... \n[179]Uh huh. \n[180]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, get this typed, get somebody to send it to the White House... \n[181]President's speech. \n[182]No, no, no, no, no after the airport. \n[183]He just got Hip to us.

Tell him to hold firm for two hours... coming home with Gold. \n[199]I'll hold. \n[200]I think it's fine? \n[201]No, it's... I'll, yes, I'm holding, but... No, it's ... \n[202]Hello -- \n[203]Look: I'm bringing in a tape, I need it copied AT ONCE onto an old acetate, and stuck in the Library of Congress.  Gotta Happen Today. \n[204]In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in... \n[205]...this the Guy. \n[206]Where is he now? \n[207]...we get our hands on him? \n[208]What's the thing with Morse Code... \n[209]Who said, \"I care not who writes a country's laws, so long as I can write its songs...\"?  Stanley Moss, folks... \n[210]No, I'm telling you, this guy, this guy is aces, this guy is the Kitty's Sleepwear, this guy, they should of given him every Oscar.  Every Oscar.  This is the... \n[211]Well, this is genius.  Who did this? \n[212]Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.
