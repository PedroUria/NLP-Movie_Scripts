{"dialogues": {"VALJEAN": "\n[1]Yes. It means I'm free. \n[2]I stole a loaf of bread My sister's child was close to death And we were starving. \n[3]I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law! \n[4]My name is Jean Valjean! \n[5]Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins \n[6]And now lets see What this new world Will do for me! \n[7]Monsieur can I help? A day's work? \n[8]Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight? \n[9]Pontarlier. \n[10]No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home. \n[11]You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer? \n[12]What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years. If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me! Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! \n[13]I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go? \n[14]I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin. \n[15]I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now! \n[16]Another story must begin! \n[17]What is this fighting all about? Will someone tear these two apart? This is a factory, not a circus. \n[18]Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute. \n[19]Deal with this, Foreman. Be as patient as you can. \n[20]Welcome, sir Come guard our laws I'm sure we're here In common cause. \n[21]The dignity of toil To stay alive. \n[22]Your face is not a face I would forget. \n[23]Get back! It may fall! \n[24]Say what you must. Don't leave it there. \n[25]Let me help you up. \n[26]No more cart driving for you! \n[27]A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale. \n[28]You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail. \n[29]Where will she end - This child without a friend? \n[30]I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this? \n[31]Is it true what I've done - \n[32]- to an innocent soul? \n[33]Had I only known then! \n[34]In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital. \n[35]Where is she? \n[36]I will see it done! I will send for her immediately! \n[37]I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert? \n[38]You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence? \n[39]You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post. \n[40]It's your duty to obey! \n[41]They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance! Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong? When I have come so far And struggled for so long? If I speak I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[42]I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free? If I speak they are condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned! \n[43]Can I conceal myself for ever more? Pretend I'm not the man I was before? And must my name until I die Be no more than an alibi? \n[44]My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean! \n[45]And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? 24601! \n[46]If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me. \n[47]Is her daughter with her? \n[48]`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this? \n[49]Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side \n[50]Be at peace! Be at peace ever more. \n[51]- shall live in my protection. \n[52]Your child will want for nothing. \n[53]And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living. \n[54]Then I will keep you warm. \n[55]Take shelter from the storm. \n[56]Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return... \n[57]Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done! \n[58]I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run! \n[59]And this I swear to you tonight - \n[60]Your child will live within my care - \n[61]And I will raise her to the light. \n[62]Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live. \n[63]Tell me, my child, what is your name? \n[64]Cosette? \n[65]I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away. This is a duty I must heed. There is a promise I have made. For I was blind to one in need, I did not see what stood before me. Now your mother is with God. Her suffering is over, And I speak here with her voice, And I stand here in her place, and from this day, and ever more - \n[66]Cosette shall live in my protection. \n[67]I will not forget my vow. \n[68]Cosette shall have a father now. \n[69]Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed. \n[70]Now may I say we are agreed? \n[71]No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget. \n[72]Where I go, you will be. \n[73]Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you! \n[74]Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace \n[75]And delight. How was I to know That so much love Was held inside me? Something fresh and young Something still unsung Fills the night. How was I to know at last That happiness can come so fast? Trusting me the way you do I'm so afraid of failing you Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share Nevermore alone Nevermore apart You have warmed my heart Like the sun. You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me. Suddenly I see What I could not see Something suddenly Has begun. \n[76]Who are you? \n[77]Monsieur Fauchelevent! \n[78]Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear. \n[79]We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again. \n[80]What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say! \n[81]Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company. \n[82]No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid. \n[83]You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn. \n[84]Cosette! Cosette! \n[85]My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street. \n[86]This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past! \n[87]Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns. \n[88]We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette! \n[89]Rue de L'Homme Armee. \n[90]And then a ship across the sea. \n[91]Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away! \n[92]Hurry, Cosette! It's time to close another door And live another day! \n[93]One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more! \n[94]One day more! \n[95]One day more! \n[96]One day more! \n[97]Tomorrow we'll be far away. \n[98]I'll take it. \n[99]`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.' \n[100]They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy \n[101]Don't shoot! \n[102]I come here as a volunteer. \n[103]That's why they let me through. \n[104]There's much that I can do. \n[105]Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do. \n[106]Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him. \n[107]We meet again... \n[108]You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands. \n[109]Get out of here. \n[110]Clear out of here! \n[111]You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again. \n[112]Go! \n[113]God on high Hear my prayer \n[114]In my need You have always been there. He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! He's like the son I might have known If God had granted me a son. The summers die One by one How soon they fly On and on And I am old And will be gone. Bring him peace Bring him joy He is young He is only a boy. You can take You can give Let him be Let him live, If I die, let me die Let him live Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home! \n[115]Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear. \n[116]How do I get out of here? \n[117]It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care. \n[118]Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid. \n[119]Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave! \n[120]Then I die. \n[121]She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free... \n[122]Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done... \n[123]There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime. \n[124]Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I? \n[125]Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know... \n[126]...What I have spoken, why I must go. \n[127]Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home! \n[128]I am ready, Fantine... \n[129]At the end of my days... \n[130]She's the best of my life... \n[131]Cosette? \n[132]Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day! \n[133]Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed... \n[134]Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try... \n[135]On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping. It's the story Of one who turned from hating A man who only learned to love When you were in his keeping. \n[136]I'm ready now, Fantine. \n[137]Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory! ", "MARIUS": "\n[1]Only one man, General Lamarque Speaks for the people here below! \n[2]With all the anger in the land, How long before the Judgement Day? \n[3]Tell everyone you know \n[4]Vive le General Lamarque! \n[5]How did you...? \n[6]Won't take a franc that I've not earned All of those bridges have been burned. \n[7]I like the way you always tease. \n[8]Eponine!

I'm lost until she's found. \n[12]A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe! She was like a ghost to me - One minute there - then she was gone! \n[13]Had you seen her today You might know how it feels To be struck to the bone By a moment of breathless delight! Had you been there today You might also have known How the world may be changed In just one burst of light And what was right seems wrong And what was wrong seems right! \n[14]I feel my soul on fire! \n[15]My world if she's not there! \n[16]The colour of desire! \n[17]The colour of despair! \n[18]In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun!

From the table in the corner They could see a world reborn And they rose with voices ringing And I can hear them now! The very words that they had sung Became their last communion On the lonely barricade at dawn. \n[58]Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on... Phantom faces at the window Phantom shadows on the floor Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more. Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me What your sacrifice was for Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no more. \n[59]Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade. \n[60]Cosette, Cosette! \n[61]Waiting for you!

Dear Cosette, he loves   you so Perhaps he will return   some day. \n[68]No, `Baron du Thenard', The circles I move in are humbler by far... Go away, Thenardier! Do you think I don't know who you are? \n[69]In God's name say what you have to say. \n[70]I know this! This was mine! This is surely some heavenly sign! \n[71]Then it's true! Then I'm right! Jean Valjean was my saviour that night! \n[72]Not so loud! Here's for you. God forgive us the things that we do. \n[73]Where is he? \n[74]It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint!

You know what that means? \n[2]No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave. \n[3]This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man. \n[4]You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law. \n[5]Five years for what you did, The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601! \n[6]And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me - 24601! \n[7]I introduce myself, Inspector of Police. I've come to take the watch I'm here to keep the peace. Please know me as Javert. I'm here at your command With honour due to each. With justice in our hands No man's beyond our reach. Let all beware. \n[8]You've done the city proud, You've raised their banner high. \n[9]You manufacture gems That anyone can buy Your people thrive. \n[10]It seems to me We may have met. \n[11]Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared. \n[12]Forgive me, sir. I would not dare - \n[13]Monsieur le Mayor. \n[14]Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl? \n[15]She will answer for her actions When you make a full report. You may rest assured, M'sieur, That she will answer to the court. \n[16]I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years.

I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same. \n[23]I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court. \n[24]And of course the thief denies it, You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean. \n[25]He will pay, and so must I. Press charges against me, sir! \n[26]Must I do as you say? \n[27]Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain! \n[28]You must think me mad! I've hunted you across the years. Men like you can never change - A man such as you! \n[29]Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! My duty is to the law. You have no rights. Come with me, 24601! \n[30]Now the wheel has turned around - Jean Valjean is nothing now. Dare you talk to me of crime And the price you had to pay. Every man is born in sin Every man must choose his way. You know nothing of Javert! I was born inside a jail. I was born with scum like you. I am from the gutter too. \n[31]There is no place for you to hide. \n[32]Wherever you may hide away - \n[33]Where's the child Cosette? \n[34]Did you catch the fellow's name? \n[35]Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert! \n[36]Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done! \n[37]Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid. \n[38]But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run? \n[39]Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him. \n[40]And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean? \n[41]Let the old man keep on running I will run him off his feet! Everyone about your business! Clear this garbage off the street! \n[42]There, out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face... He knows his way in the dark Mine is the way of the Lord Those who follow the path of the righteous Shall have their reward And if they fall As Lucifer fell - The flame! The sword! Stars in your multitudes! Scarce to be counted Filling the darkness With order and light - You are the sentinels Silent and sure Keeping watch in the night - Keeping watch in the night... You know your place in the sky You hold your course \n[43]And your aim And each in your season Returns and returns And is always the same And if you fall As Lucifer fell You fall In flame! And so it must be, and so it is written On the doorway to paradise That those who falter And those who fall Must pay the price! Lord, let me find him That I may see him Safe behind bars! I will never rest till then! This I swear This I swear by the stars! \n[44]One day more to revolution. We will nip it in the bud. We'll be ready for these schoolboys. They will wet themselves with blood! \n[45]I will join these people's heroes I will follow where they go. I will learn their little secrets, I will know the things they know. \n[46]One more day to revolution We will nip it in the bud We'll be ready for these schoolboys - \n[47]I can find out the truth! I know their ways, Fought their wars, Served my time In the days Of my youth. \n[48]Listen, my friends, I have done as I said. I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel. \n[49]I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light - \n[50]Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court! \n[51]The law is inside out. The world is upside down. \n[52]You've hungered for this all your life. Take your revenge. How right you should kill with a knife. \n[53]Don't understand... \n[54]Valjean, take care! I'm warning you. \n[55]Once a thief, forever a thief. What you want, you always steal. You would trade your life for mine. Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert! \n[56]I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed! \n[57]The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice! \n[58]One more step and you die. \n[59]Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind!
