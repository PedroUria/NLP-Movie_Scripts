{"dialogues": {"MARGARET": "\n[1]I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me what I want to hear.   Give it to me. \n[2]You should get paid extra for being so darn funny. Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out the door. \n[3]This is Margaret. \n[4]You've been thinking about our talk because I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth, McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically whores himself.   Know what they have in common?   A Pulitzer.  Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty years, but that's how long it's been since you've written a book this good. \n[5]I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books, I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature.   Do the publicity. Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears \"yes.\" \n[6]You're making the right decision!   Great news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm going to lose you... Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their mind. \n[7]Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,      6. \n[8]I got Frank to do publicity. \n[9]When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here? \n[10]We're going to his office.   Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office... \n[11]That's cute.   You gonna call her today? \n[12]Are you bored here?   Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day? \n[13]You have another late night out? \n[14]I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday. \n[15]You'll magically unwrinkle? \n[16]You have magic pants? \n[17]Does this work on more than just your pants? \n[18]Buy me some. \n[19]I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work.   If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it? \n[20]Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word.     8. \n[21]Hey, Bob. \n[22]I'm lettin' you go, Bob. \n[23]You're fired. \n[24]This isn't working out. \n[25]I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity.   You said it was impossible. \n[26]I just talked to him.   He's in. \n[27]No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even call to ask him. \n[28]All you had to do to was pick up the phone. That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to find a new job, and then you can say you resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are sealed. Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door. \n[29]What's he doing? Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door. \n[30]Oh Bob, don't do it... \n[31]What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized way out of this. \n[32]Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent.   I'm firing you because you don't work hard.   So if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk.   Because if you say one more word, Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we perfectly clear? Bob nods. \n[33]Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll     10. Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones. \n[34]We need to call his authors and explain what happened.   And get Frank's publicity schedule figured out pronto. \n[35]I gave you the weekend off? \n[36]She tell you to quit? \n[37]Who is this guy? \n[38]Go get him.   But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office. \n[39]Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up. \n[40]Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember. \n[41]Don't have it... \n[42]Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend.   Without a doubt the worst ever written. \n[43]It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability.   The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language. \n[44]Did you see the pass letter I wrote him? \n[45]You wrote the book. \n[46]You're Dante Dickens? \n[47]I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.     13. \n[48]Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for citizenship. \n[49]Yes.   And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down. \n[50]I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States? \n[51]\"Affect me at work?\"   I'll lose my job! \n[52]Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it. \n[53]14. Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick. \n[54]Well then, get it published at another house. \n[55]All? \n[56]I'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book. \n[57]I will never publish your book.   Ever. \n[58]This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss. \n[59]Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere! We're getting married! Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about. \n[60]We are! \n[61]Stop playing around, honey. Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused. \n[62]Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him about us.   About us getting married. \n[63]We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When it's right, it's right. \n[64]Nope.   True love.   Got it bad. \n[65]Of course we are. \n[66]What? \n[67]C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice. Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents. \n[68]Are we done here? \n[69]No one.   With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew. \n[70]My parents are dead! \n[71]We're telling his family this weekend. \n[72]Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...  ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.     18. \n[73]At Richard's parent's house. \n[74]In his hometown. \n[75]Why don't you tell him? \n[76]Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska. That's where Richard is from. Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up. \n[77]I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for that? Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.     19. Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his appointment book and writes down some information. \n[78]There are no \"T's\" or \"I's\" in \"Love\" Mr. Gilbertson. Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work. \n[79]Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus, that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this INS interview. Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice. \n[80]So you need to figure out the travel, schedule a justice of the peace for next week, and get my lawyer on the phone. Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face. \n[81]But first, run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold. Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move. \n[82]Hello?   Richard?   Richard! Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left. \n[83]Richard, come back here. Margaret tries not to make a scene. \n[84]Richard.   Richard. Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception. \n[85]Come back to the office! Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face. \n[86]Well, we need to talk. \n[87]Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time.   Sometimes you need to sack up. \n[88]You wanna be an editor?   You need to make     21. \n[89]I'm doing what? \n[90]You work for me! \n[91]Look, I came to this town alone and with nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No way. \n[92]Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend, and I'll make you editor.   Deal? Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it. \n[93]And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a- bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even have hotels in Alaska? \n[94]Are you done with the press release? \n[95]Well let's finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk.   Okay? Dejected, Richard goes back to work. \n[96]So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet points. \n[97]Don't make me hate you. Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes through.   The attendant gives Richard a look. \n[98]I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on that book. \n[99]Edited it.   It was one of my favorites. \n[100]You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines? \n[101]Ex-girlfriend, huh?     24. \n[102]There you are.   Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag. \n[103]I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret. \n[104]Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard. \n[105]You mean him? The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record straight. \n[106]No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant. \n[107]Well, he's... indispensable.     25. The Handsome man isn't buying it. \n[108]And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go. Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along. \n[109]I have to go now. \n[110]Have a great life. Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she takes it. \n[111]Me neither. Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the exit.   Everyone else follows her lead. \n[112]Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel? \n[113]Surprise?   Another surprise? \n[114]I'm really not good with surprises. \n[115]Are you witches? \n[116]The Dragon Lady!? Richard shrugs. \n[117]I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile. \n[118]I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going. \n[119]Who are you people? Richard lets Margaret wonder. \n[120]I thought it was the dragon lady? \n[121]Uh huh.     32. Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps on her. \n[122]What a great name.   Balzac's \"Lost Illusions\" is one of my favorite novels. \n[123]Thank you.   Where's Richard's room? \n[124]Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie. \n[125]Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his breathing at night. \n[126]I'm about 15 seconds from bitch. \n[127]What is going on here? \n[128]You had no idea they knew about us getting married? \n[129]Well, we just gotta tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. \n[130]Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em the truth.   About us.     34. \n[131]What do you mean no way?   This is crazy. \n[132]Well I don't like this. \n[133]Selfish? \n[134]How is it selfish to tell the truth? \n[135]Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me. \n[136]Why did you tell me that you were poor? \n[137]Well, you never told me you were rich. \n[138]I don't know, how about, \"Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry.\" \n[139]No I wouldn't. \n[140]I'm not anti-rich. \n[141]I earned... \n[142]Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant. \n[143]Sure of that? \n[144]Well, come on.   If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show. \n[145]I went to Union college in upstate New York. It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink. \n[146]Lime? \n[147]Since I graduated college. Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't say thank you. \n[148]Oh, who's counting... Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her. \n[149]Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or seventeen years.   Exactly.     37. \n[150]Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th. I'm a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile. \n[151]I need some protein. \n[152]Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet. Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple. \n[153]I'm editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret. \n[154]You're a Gertrude? \n[155]I'm sure it's been a curse. \n[156]Not exactly... \n[157]Can I tell this one, honey?     40. \n[158]I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday.   Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, \"shhhh.\"   So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says \"I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?\" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. \n[159]I said yes. The group gives a collective \"ahh\".   Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand. \n[160]Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so embarrassed. \n[161]Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside. \n[162]Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear. \n[163]Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear.     42. \n[164]I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind.   Our job is to help you succeed.   He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass. She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off.   Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone. \n[165]Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened. Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up. \n[166]Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house. \n[167]Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this.   This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.   She runs. \n[168]... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is- always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks. \n[169]43. Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering. \n[170]Take the dog!   Take the dog! \n[171]This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon, bring back the phone. Richard calls out from the house. \n[172]The eagle took my phone! \n[173]Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take the dog, so I saved it, then it came back and took my phone.     44. \n[174]Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I need it! \n[175]Oh. \n[176]I'm not going anywhere. \n[177]Definitely not a salmon. The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation. Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.     45. \n[178]What's going on? \n[179]What's that smell? Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about an inch away from her face. \n[180]Ahhh!!! Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone. After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior. \n[181]Good lord. \n[182]Want me to do it? \n[183]What?   I'm just working on my tan.  It's been a long day. Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging. \n[184]50. \n[185]Chicago, right? \n[186]And now you're back? \n[187]Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss... \n[188]For you to get divorced? \n[189]Are we talking about the same guy? \n[190]Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused. \n[191]I mean he was a total player.   Before we started dating.   Six months ago. \n[192]That surprises you? \n[193]We don't really talk much about stuff like that. \n[194]No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting married.   I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed. \n[195]I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed to you in high school? \n[196]You must have... \n[197]I would hope so. \n[198]I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers. \n[199]We are awful people. \n[200]I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad. Margaret just smiles. \n[201]Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He looks genuinely unnerved. \n[202]Richard, is that you? \n[203]Richard, are you... Then out of nowhere, Balzac  startles Margaret. \n[204]I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you. Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself. \n[205]Will you just hand me a towel! Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes.. \n[206]You're flashing brain! Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way, and she wraps herself in it.     56. \n[207]You can cover up any time! Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by the window. \n[208]Explain yourself! \n[209]You didn't hear me? \n[210]I didn't jump you.  I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know you were here. \n[211]I was running from the dog! Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously. \n[212]Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself. \n[213]Go take a shower.   You stink. \n[214]I'm never gonna to get to sleep. Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black. \n[215]Oh.   Well.   Thanks. Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling. \n[216]Can we not talk about this? \n[217]It wasn't weird. \n[218]Because we're... like teammates. \n[219]We are teammates.   And teammates see each other naked in the locker room.   All the time.   It's not a big deal. \n[220]Good night, Richard. The two lay awake in silence for another beat. \n[221]Yes? \n[222]Okay... \n[223]Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow. \n[224]Who is it?     59. \n[225]Uh, sure.   Just a second. Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head. \n[226]Your mother. Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts his arm around Margaret. \n[227]You don't have to go to all this trouble. Really. Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret. \n[228]Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had someone make me breakfast in bed since I was a little kid. Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll. \n[229]You just take all this for granted?   Your family, this house... Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret. \n[230]Why are you doing this to them? \n[231]Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me here. \n[232]I didn't make you do anything.   You could of said no. \n[233]I get why a not rich person would do this. But you've got everything.   It doesn't make any sense. \n[234]I wish it wasn't my business.   But unfortunately, it has become my business, because I made a deal with someone I thought I could trust. Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated. \n[235]Fine. \n[236]I'll be ready in 20 minutes. Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls. \n[237]These are really good. She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves. \n[238]That's great to hear. \n[239]But I don't... \n[240]Is this really necessary? \n[241]Why is he handcuffed to the machine? \n[242]Nice. From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out. \n[243]You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a vegetarian for six months in college. Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines. \n[244]Gimme that. Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish. Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon. \n[245]Is that why you're still pissed at him? \n[246]You loved this? \n[247]You wanted this? \n[248]I wasn't gonna forget. Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence. \n[249]What kind of things changed? \n[250]You mean, like, Gertrude? \n[251]Told me what? Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away. \n[252]The creepy teenage proposal? \n[253]You were a freak by the way. \n[254]And she was right to break up with you. \n[255]For a little while?   Don't sell yourself short. \n[256]So you moved to the open arms of New York City? \n[257]With scheduling my pilates? \n[258]...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To Kill a Mockingbird. \n[259]So we're \"getting married\" so you can give daddy the finger?     67. \n[260]I guess that's a compliment. \n[261]Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're more screwed up than I am, Paxton. \n[262]One more question... \n[263]That wasn't my question. \n[264]Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone. \n[265]Hey. They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word. \n[266]You know him? \n[267]Of course he was.   How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne. \n[268]Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout. \n[269]Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff? \n[270]That must have been handy in High School. \n[271]Should you leave the cart? \n[272]I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me. \n[273]I told you never to talk about that. \n[274]Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade? \n[275]The Y. \n[276]Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang. \n[277]I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair. \n[278]You know.  Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live... Richard shakes his head. \n[279]Well they were good. \n[280]I really like \"The O.C.\".   Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really like it. \n[281]Allergic to pine nuts. \n[282]Afraid of penguins. \n[283]Haven't slept with a man in a year and a half. \n[284]Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that gets a Holy shit?   I've been busy! \n[285]That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants. \n[286]Yeah, well, I'm not good at that. \n[287]No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces. Top notch. \n[288]Yes.   You will. \n[289]I need a computer and the internet.   Now. \n[290]No, no, no.   I need on now.   I've got a Booker prize winning author demanding I send him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that \"makes\" him do publicity. The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese. \n[291]Listen to me asshole... The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear. \n[292]I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in Alaska! \n[293]I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone     73. \n[294]I give you my word as an editor and a friend... The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS. \n[295]Five more minutes!   Please!     75. Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway. Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to apologize, but needs to keep working. \n[296]Sorry. \n[297]Hey guys. Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but look guilty as hell. \n[298]Yeah.   We'll see what he says. \n[299]You ready to get back to the house? \n[300]Well let's go.   See you at the wedding, Gertrude. Gertrude just smiles. \n[301]So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies. \n[302]That was it?   I was gone for awhile... \n[303]I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy. \n[304]What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old. \n[305]What, ah, are you doing? \n[306]Ya know, I've got to get back. \n[307]I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher. \n[308]OK, OK.   I \"accept your circle.\" Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire. \n[309]I'm gonna head back. \n[310]I think I am. Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her. \n[311]Me what? \n[312]Chant what? \n[313]I can't... \n[314]I don't know any chants! \n[315]Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low noise. \n[316]...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... \n[317]82. They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it. \n[318]...to the wall... More sand.   More fire. \n[319]...to sweat drop down my balls... Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say? \n[320]...to all these bitches crawl... Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken out into a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lil John song.   She continues to dance. \n[321]...To all skee skee motherfucker... Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off. \n[322]...all skee skee got damn... From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out. \n[323]He told me I had to chant! \n[324]Just buttoning up here. \n[325]Yeah, it's a little snug. \n[326]It's a lovely dress. Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying. \n[327]It's beautiful. \n[328]How'd they stay together? \n[329]No, no, no.   I can't.   Really. \n[330]Well.   Thing is... Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't. \n[331]...the dress is just a little tight. \n[332]We need to talk. \n[333]Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away from here.   From everyone.   Now. \n[334]No!   I did that.   It did not help. \n[335]We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here. \n[336]Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel. \n[337]It doesn't matter. \n[338]Where are we? \n[339]I'm fine. \n[340]Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine. \n[341]This coming from the sociopath. \n[342]I'd never bring me here. \n[343]I mean to Alaska. \n[344]You're sick.   Doing this to them. \n[345]They love you.   Do you get that? \n[346]And you're still willing to lie to them? \n[347]Didn't know what? \n[348]I didn't know! \n[349]You think I'm stupid? \n[350]I forgot!   OK?   I forgot! \n[351]What it was like! \n[352]To have a family!   I forgot what it was like to have a family.   I've been on my own since I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces...     89. Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat. \n[353]I'm going to take a walk. \n[354]Alone.   I need alone time. \n[355]I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time. I need a second. \n[356]Stop right there! Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put. \n[357]I'm going to be over there.   Away from you. Just sit down, turn around, and act like you're not here. Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks away from him on the glacier. \n[358]You can do this.   Couple more hours, and then you'll never see these people again. Eventually you'll write a letter. Apologize.   Send the necklace back. \n[359]No talking!     90. \n[360]Again, you're not supposed to be... Margaret doesn't finish her sentence. \n[361]Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!! Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that -- Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight. \n[362]Oh, thank God! Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING. Margaret is really scared. \n[363]Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing? \n[364]Don't do that.     91. \n[365]The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do that! \n[366]Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way. \n[367]I'm really cold. \n[368]\n[369]You said it was \"no biggie\". \n[370]Yeah.   I'm fine. Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully. \n[371]You shouldn't of laughed at me. \n[372]Yeah.   While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark. They might kiss. \n[373]And? \n[374]Yeah.   I was. \n[375]Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain her composure. \n[376]You wanna call it off?     93. \n[377]Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we get back. \n[378]It's fine. \n[379]It's OK.   Tell him. \n[380]He's only doing it because he loves you. \n[381]Just stop.   Think about this. \n[382]Matches the shoes. Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers. \n[383]Nice song. Richard shrugs his shoulders. \n[384]I guess so. Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up, Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same guy from the liquor store and the strip club. \n[385]You look disgusting. \n[386]Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. \n[387]Ramone. \n[388]No. \n[389]I have something to say.   It's not a question though. \n[390]Uh.   Um.   No. \n[391]Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the \"wedding.\" \n[392]Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.     99. \n[393]I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me. \n[394]Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.  Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't blame him.   This is all my fault.  Could you get the band started?   And give these people something to drink.  And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport. \n[395]Take care of him. \n[396]Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good news.   Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up. \n[397]Yup.   He's in.   For now.     100. \n[398]Yeah.   Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags. \n[399]Thanks.   Fun weekend. \n[400]Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them. \n[401]It was getting too messy.   We weren't going to be able to keep it up. \n[402]I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I think she meant what she said.   She's a great girl, you should stay.   It's the right thing.   You're perfect for each other. \n[403]Don't worry about me.   I'll survive. \n[404]Yup.   This is it.     101. Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard. Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself. \n[405]Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good person.   You deserve it. She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but Margaret denies it. \n[406]Goodbye, Richard. \n[407]I'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now? \n[408]I'll publish your book. Gilbertson smiles. \n[409]Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat. \n[410]Tell him I'm not here. \n[411]Oh, good lord. \n[412]What the hell are you doing? Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress. \n[413]About what? \n[414]As boss and assistant. \n[415]Things change? \n[416]Is that the best you got? Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say \"see, that's what I said.\" Richard composes himself. \n[417]What's your point? \n[418]This wasn't supposed to happen. Richard looks Margaret in the eye. \n[419]I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved. Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him. The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson. \n[420]Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might affect you at work? Gilbertson has no retort.     115. \n[421]Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish your book after all. \n[422]Absolutely not.   But who knows?  We might by the time you get out of jail. Gilbertson makes a \"go to hell\" face and shuffles off. Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles. \n[423]I've got some explaining to do. Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of Richard's family. \n[424]Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for years, but we've just recently begun to see each other romantically.  I want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska.  I'm not sure when you are going to see him get married, but I promise as long as I'm with him, he'll be happy. Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen. ", "RICHARD": "\n[1]Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the model on the walls and is really, really hot. \n[2]Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late. Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds his pants on the floor and puts them on. \n[3]Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard. \n[4]Baby, I just can't do this anymore.     2. \n[5]You're just too much for me.   And I'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job. \n[6]Let's not end it like that. It's been an amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you. And you should know that you have the nicest ass I've ever been with. \n[7]I do.   It's magnificent. \n[8]I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body.   Richard shakes his head \"no\" and smiles. \n[9]I really gotta go. \n[10]Jillian, you are the best. \n[11]See ya tomorrow. \n[12]4. Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard. \n[13]She doesn't exactly consult with me on these things. \n[14]Welcome to my nightmare. The doors close as... \n[15]You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. \n[16]Nice job. \n[17]I'm sure.   You want him on the phone? \n[18]What? Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed. \n[19]Uh... \n[20]7. Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried because he doesn't know where she's going with this. \n[21]Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long. \n[22]Yes. \n[23]No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles. \n[24]Anything that's wrinkled. \n[25]Will do. Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point. \n[26]Got it. \n[27]He's up and about to pop. \n[28]No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this weekend. \n[29]It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday. But no big deal.   You were right before, I need to stay focused.   Professional. \n[30]Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.  Mom, she's making me work this weekend. It's not like I volunteered.  I'm sure dad is pissed. Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up. \n[31]I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye. Richard hangs up the phone. \n[32]Sorry about that.   Damage control. \n[33]No.   No.  Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is. Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.     11. \n[34]Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson? \n[35]He said you knew each other.   You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We rescheduled on him four times. \n[36]I'll charge up the cattle prod. \n[37]Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs you right away. The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face.     15. \n[38]Who's getting married? \n[39]You and him? \n[40]Assistant. \n[41]Uh-huh. Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm around her.   Richard is truly afraid. \n[42]I'm, uh, marrying my boss? Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together. Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head. \n[43]Plum. \n[44]No.   Plum is \"smokier\" than purple.     17. \n[45]Tulips.   But only when they're in season. \n[46]Miss Mittens. \n[47]Nope. Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad. \n[48]We are? \n[49]Sitka. \n[50]Alaska. \n[51]Assistant. \n[52]I quit. Richard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand.     20. \n[53]You shut up.   You just lost your \"I get to tell Richard what to do\" privileges. \n[54]You want to talk with me?   Fine.   Grab your broom and let's go. Margaret is dumbstruck.   The receptionist is shocked.   The elevator arrives and Richard gets in.   Margaret follows. As the doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist. \n[55]Watch my phones! \n[56]Your plan is psychotic. \n[57]Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice? \n[58]OK.   Fine.   Then if we \"make this happen\"? You're promoting me to editor. \n[59]We go to Alaska and lie to my family?   I risk going to jail?   Well, you're making me editor for that.   I mean, did you think I'd do this out of the kindness of my heart? \n[60]You know, during my employee orientation, the HR rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you. \n[61]Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that sounds like your problem.   Not mine. Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand. \n[62]No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really. And you have to poop in a bucket.   But otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.   But with bears. \n[63]Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents? Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question. \n[64]Almost. \n[65]I told \u00e2\u0080\u0098em we've been dating for six months. We've kept it a secret from everyone...  ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate. Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor. \n[66]Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's     23. Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass. The impatient attendant is getting frustrated. \n[67]I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a little flustered too.   Haven't been home for awhile, hope they like her! The gate attendant smiles. \n[68]OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks. Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors. \n[69]Hey, he's reading... \n[70]Oh, you can tell him the truth. \n[71]That's me. Richard turns to close the overhead compartment. \n[72]What are you guys doing here?   What's with the sign? \n[73]Didn't tell you what? \n[74]Uh.   Margaret?   You need to come over here. Like now.   Honey. The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for Margaret to come over.   Margaret winces. \n[75]Everyone, this is Margaret. \n[76]Now, ah, where did you hear that?   The whole \"getting married\" thing? \n[77]What, ah, did you tell him? \n[78]No.   Really.   What did you say? \n[79]It wasn't a secret.   We didn't tell anyone.     28. \n[80]No, I didn't mean... \n[81]She's not good with surprises. \n[82]Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise. Richard points to a small island about a mile away. \n[83]Hey dad. Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff. \n[84]You too. \n[85]Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion. Grandma Annie interrupts. \n[86]C'mon dad... \n[87]Don't listen to him, Margaret. \n[88]Calm down. \n[89]Hell if I know. \n[90]You think I'd bring you here if I did? \n[91]Tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em what? \n[92]Wrong answer.   No way. \n[93]No, crazy was lying to the federal officer. \n[94]Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony!   For one second could you not be so selfish? \n[95]Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day? \n[96]Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone.   We need to protect the people downstairs.   We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind. \n[97]What've I lied to you about? \n[98]I never said that. \n[99]When does that come up?     35. \n[100]Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew. \n[101]Come on!   You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti- rich. \n[102]Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it worse?   You have money! \n[103]...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah. You need new material. \n[104]You were going to promote me anyway. \n[105]Nope.   Not at all. Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror. \n[106]Be right back. Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, \"What was that?\" \n[107]She's been there since she was nineteen. \n[108]There's some salmon. Margaret shakes her head no. \n[109]Crab? Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter. Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding. \n[110]Uh, sure.   Honey. \n[111]I'm so proud of my girl.     38. From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts. \n[112]Gert!? Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved. \n[113]What are you?   What are you doing here? \n[114]From Chicago? Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has forgotten about Margaret completely. \n[115]You what? \n[116]Did your husband move up here too? \n[117]Oh my God.   I'm sorry. \n[118]Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. \n[119]Uh, uh, um, I... \n[120]Uh.   Sure. \n[121]I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude. \n[122]Margaret Mill's phone.  One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. \n[123]It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem. \n[124]Go where? \n[125]Um.   She's outside. Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window. They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head. \n[126]What are you doing? \n[127]Are you drunk? \n[128]Did the dingo eat your baby, too? \n[129]Relax.   I've got your information backed up on the laptop.   I'll just get you a new phone and switch the number.   No problem. \n[130]Now come on.   You're going somewhere with my mom and the girls. \n[131]You want a new phone?   You're going. \n[132]Why's that, Mr. Maguire? \n[133]Sorry \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout that. \n[134]You're right.   Don't know what I was thinking... \n[135]That's great for them. \n[136]Good.   Busy.   You know. \n[137]Congratulations. \n[138]Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been thinking about this moment for a long time. \n[139]Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's in New York.   We have jobs. \n[140]It's just what? \n[141]Again with the secretary thing!   I've told you, I'm an assistant!     48. \n[142]Well if I'm \"just a secretary\", why would you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like you're doing great without me. \n[143]Then how is it?   Explain it to me. Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening. \n[144]This man was a doctor? \n[145]I'm not sure this is coming out right. \n[146]Stop being so dramatic. \n[147]So this is all about what you want? \n[148]And me in New York with Margaret?   That isn't serious?     49. \n[149]Things change, dad. \n[150]Things change. \n[151]Yes.   Things change. \n[152]Nice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby moments more often.   This is great. Richard drops his club and walks back to the house. \n[153]I didn't know you were home!   I was outside chopping wood! \n[154]I had my iPod on!  Why did you jump me? Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts. \n[155]You didn't see me? \n[156]Wait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me? \n[157]Mmm-Hmmm. \n[158]Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there. You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual harassment.     57. Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his neck.   He gently puts him outside their room. \n[159]There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before she makes a coat out of you. Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without looking back, Richard gets the final shot. \n[160]Puppy hater. \n[161]It was kinda weird seeing you naked. \n[162]I'm just saying.   It was weird. \n[163]How was that not weird? \n[164]We're like teammates?     58. \n[165]Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the bed? \n[166]Margaret? \n[167]Don't take this the wrong way. \n[168]You're a very beautiful woman. Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard. \n[169]What the... \n[170]Come on in mom! Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee. \n[171]Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls. \n[172]I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new phone. \n[173]No problem. \n[174]I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught us.   Damn, that was close. Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay attention to Margaret. \n[175]I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these. Margaret looks at Richard with disgust. \n[176]Huh? \n[177]You made me bring you here!   You told me I     61. \n[178]And what?   Start over at the bottom again? No way. \n[179]Know what?   This is none of your business. \n[180]You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show you why you're here. \n[181]We leave in a half hour. \n[182]Yes sir, it is! \n[183]See ya on the line, Bek Bek. \n[184]Put this on.   I'll meet you outside. \n[185]Ah.   Put it on. \n[186]You'll thank me later. Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her     63. \n[187]So his hands don't go too far.   So he doesn't... Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces. \n[188]Ah, it's been a while. \n[189]Okay, okay. Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly demonstrates with a knife. \n[190]You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt the knife, and then pull with the grain of the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine.     64. Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort. \n[191]Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein.   Then send her down the line. Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before offering a knife to Margaret. \n[192]Wanna try it? Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch. \n[193]If it's too gross for you... \n[194]I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me to earn my stripes before I took over. \n[195]Nah, I loved it here. \n[196]The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the slime line.   I loved this place.   The people.   Growing up, running this place was all I wanted. Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish. \n[197]I wanted to run this place. It was comfortable here.   It was what I knew.  Don't forget the spine.     65. \n[198]But then things changed.   And it wasn't so comfortable anymore. \n[199]Stuff. \n[200]Yeah... Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something. \n[201]Oh my god.   She told you didn't she? \n[202]About the... you know. \n[203]Ah, shit! \n[204]OK, get it all out. \n[205]You done? Margaret nods yes.     66. \n[206]I know now that it was the right thing, but it screwed me up for a little while. \n[207]When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore. \n[208]At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then I fell in love with it. \n[209]With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd always read a lot, but until I worked for you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I realized that we could find the next Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or... \n[210]Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that? Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of passion for the job. \n[211]So when I tell my folks that I want to spend my life finding books?   My dad goes ape shit.                                                             \"How dare you forsake your family... you'll come crawling back to us... you're nothing without our help.\"   I left that night and we didn't talk for a year. Haven't been back here since. \n[212]No. Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look. \n[213]Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with you...   I get the promotion and I get to show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make a good prop. \n[214]So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I trustworthy again? \n[215]Yeah.   Thanks. \n[216]Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian. \n[217]I know.   Just lashing out. Margaret smiles. \n[218]Hey Ramone. \n[219]He was my shop teacher. \n[220]Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of the year. \n[221]You got the phone I called about? \n[222]Thanks, Ramone. \n[223]It's our stuff.     69. Richard points to the \"Paxton General Store\" sign. \n[224]You have no idea. \n[225]It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such a prude. \n[226]I doubt it.   When I started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things. \n[227]I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal. \n[228]Where? \n[229]Margaret 1, Richard 0. \n[230]At Woodstock?     70. \n[231]What'd they sing again? \n[232]You had a lot of soul there, Canada. \n[233]Wow.   I'm getting shut out here. \n[234]Knew that. \n[235]Huh. \n[236]Holy shit!   You are a lesbian! A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty look. \n[237]My bad. The mother walks on.   Margaret is mortified and walks faster.     71. \n[238]That's a really long time. \n[239]I knew it had been slow going, but I figured there was a booty call in there somewhere. \n[240]I find that hard to believe. \n[241]I'll have to take your word for it. \n[242]How, exactly, do you define top notch? Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.   In an instant, she's all business. \n[243]C'mon.   I got an idea. Richard leads Margaret to the door.   As they are leaving Margaret shouts out. \n[244]Thanks for letting us use your computer. \n[245]Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting?   It's been years. \n[246]She'll be out of there in two shakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of second graders.   He stops transfixed. \n[247]Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in. \n[248]Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs. \n[249]Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this after school for a week? \n[250]Was not! \n[251]C'mon!  I had the shot.   I took it. Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times. \n[252]What?   You loved my Top Gun. \n[253]That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous. Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Gertrude is not impressed. \n[254]That cuts deep.   I'll have you know that     76. Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down. \n[255]Uh, is something wrong? \n[256]It's been awhile, but I can still tell when something's wrong with you. Gertrude doesn't want to say anything. \n[257]What is it?   You know I hate it when you get all quiet. \n[258]Better way to say what? \n[259]Are you apologizing for high school? \n[260]Oh, thank God.   I thought this was like, something big. \n[261]I coulda used this about five years ago, but I'm all good now, promise.   Thank you for saying that, though. Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point.   She pulls herself together. \n[262]77. \n[263]Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Rewind. \n[264]My wedding day isn't the best time for you to bring up the idea of us dating? Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up. Bringing this up is very hard for her. \n[265]Why are you doing this? \n[266]No, I don't.   I don't know it. Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he opens his mouth, he can't find the words. Then, from the door, an interruption. \n[267]Uh, you all done?     78. \n[268]Great.   Great. \n[269]Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh. \n[270]Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head. \n[271]Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do this.   You should really go try on the dress for my mom. \n[272]Whatever. Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but doesn't push it.     79. \n[273]I'm a little busy. \n[274]Go for another run. \n[275]I'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping... \n[276]OK, high maintenance.   Let's go. \n[277]You don't know where we're going. Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off. \n[278]The north pole.   Congratulations, we made it.  It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better let me take it from here. \n[279]Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields?   And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer. \n[280]Lady, you've got issues. \n[281]It doesn't stop there. \n[282]Oh, please. \n[283]You drove! \n[284]Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.     88. \n[285]I explained to you... \n[286]Of course. \n[287]Like you didn't know. \n[288]That we were going to lie to them. \n[289]Well that makes you either stupid, or ignorant. \n[290]No, but what's behind door number two... \n[291]Forgot what? \n[292]What what was like? \n[293]We need to head back... \n[294]What? Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look. \n[295]But... \n[296]Margaret! \n[297]Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous. \n[298]Margaret? Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her. He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the direction he last saw Margaret. \n[299]Margaret?   I know I'm breaking \"the rules\" here, but where are you? He takes one more step before he hears... \n[300]I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll get you out of there.   You've broken through an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No biggie. \n[301]Don't do what? \n[302]It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to be careful here though, I don't want us both to fall in.   Stay still, OK? \n[303]So, I'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out.   OK? \n[304]Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice. \n[305]So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits. I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't freak out. Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word. \n[306]When I get you all the way out, I need you to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you over there. Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her \"over the threshold\" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks once they're safe.     92. \n[307]I've, uh, never done that before. \n[308]Yeah.   Well.   You OK? \n[309]You woulda laughed at me. \n[310]Gertrude wants me back. Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down. \n[311]Well.   It seemed like you were having... second thoughts. \n[312]Maybe we should do it.   Come clean. \n[313]If you do. \n[314]Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk. \n[315]What did you do? Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself. \n[316]What did you do, dad?! \n[317]You made a deal with him?   On my behalf? \n[318]That's none of your business. \n[319]The hell it is.   It is not fine! \n[320]You do not get to make this decision.   This is my decision.  The truth is... I've been working for Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we started dating.   I recently asked her to marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at     95. \n[321]Come on, we gotta get ready. Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court. \n[322]What was I thinking?   They act like they're nice, but really, they're evil. \n[323]Are you defending him?   Are you defending the king dick? \n[324]Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Without this, I might've ended up back here. Up at the house, Debbie opens the door. \n[325]Coming mom!  Time to sack up. Richard winks and goes inside.   Margaret follows, not sure. \n[326]You look gorgeous. \n[327]So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl? \n[328]What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner. \n[329]Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand. \n[330]Now wait... \n[331]So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now. \n[332]Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird? \n[333]Great exit back there. \n[334]Same old, same old, around here. \n[335]I'll let her know.  Why did you tell them all that? \n[336]Don't start lying to me now. Margaret stops for a moment. \n[337]But... but what about you?   What are you gonna do? Margaret wants to keep the conversation short. \n[338]So what?   This is it? \n[339]Thanks. Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss. When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed. Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong. \n[340]Waddya mean? \n[341]I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused. \n[342]You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought about being with you for a long time.   A long time.   When you said those things at the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you say those things.      103. \n[343]But as crazy as this seems.   I know now... that we're just not meant to be. Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched. \n[344]Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret? I felt sick.   For the three years we worked together, I wanted to be as far away from her as possible.   But now that she's gone? I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me. What is that? The question hangs in the air. \n[345]I think I have to find out. \n[346]If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry. \n[347]I'm so sorry.  But, I gotta go. \n[348]Are you OK? \n[349]What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see Margaret. \n[350]Who you gonna report her to, mom? \n[351]I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And she didn't violate me. \n[352]I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful thing to do.   But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me.   I think she's... the one. \n[353]No, I didn't.   Not until she left. \n[354]I don't know.   I've got to get to the airport to find out. Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.     105. \n[355]But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any second.   I might not make it. \n[356]I don't have time to explain this to you. \n[357]I don't care. \n[358]I don't care.   I love you and want you to understand.   But I'm not asking your permission here.   I'm doing this. \n[359]I promise, Grandma. \n[360]The best way? \n[361]Hey Chuck, it's Richard. \n[362]Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could you stop it for me? \n[363]Oh, c'mon Chuck! \n[364]Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath. \n[365]You've made that crystal clear. \n[366]Shit!   She's never going to pick up... \n[367]Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor... \n[368]Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane. The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she doesn't know either. RICHARD  (cont'd)  This certainly isn't how I wanted to do this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So here goes. \n[369]I know you're used to being on your own. And that you're comfortable with your life the way it is.   And that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together.   I know, because I felt the exact same way. \n[370]And you know what else I know?   I know that I'm tired of being alone.   And I think you're tired of being alone too.   So come on.   Talk to me.   Please. The Handsome Man turns to Margaret. \n[371]We need to talk. (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the plane with the passengers watching. \n[372]Have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years? \n[373]Things change, Margaret. \n[374]Yeah, things change. \n[375]Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore? Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.     113. \n[376]Because I am sick that you left.   And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together? Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it. Gilbertson panics. \n[377]But it did. Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed. ", "GEOFFREY": "\n[1]So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot about you.   All of it bad. Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical sling backs. \n[2]I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he was marrying the devil woman. \n[3]Either way. \n[4]Welcome home.   Good to see \u00e2\u0080\u0098ya. \n[5]Been a while. \n[6]And don't let him outside, or the eagles will snatch him. \n[7]I mean it.   They come out of that rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry. \n[8]Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long? \n[9]No.   How many years is that?   Exactly. Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look. \n[10]I was never good with big numbers.   That makes you... thirty six now? \n[11]Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he roll over when you whistle? Debbie hits Geoffrey. \n[12]Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence. \n[13]Feels like yesterday to me. \n[14]Yeah.   How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly. Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in. \n[15]So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around? \n[16]...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water. \n[17]She just does.   I stopped trying to figure out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr. Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is. \n[18]Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's, uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going. \n[19]So.   How's work with you? \n[20]I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan? \n[21]We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore.   We're going global. \n[22]I could really use your help. \n[23]I know.   I know.   It's just... \n[24]You're only a secretary. This pisses Richard off immediately. \n[25]Just because you call yourself an \"assistant\" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary. \n[26]It's not like that and you know it. \n[27]Last week, a man stuck his finger up my butt... \n[28]...and it got me thinking about you. \n[29]Just shut up for a second, okay?   I want you to have what I built.   But I'm running out of time to show you things. \n[30]I'm not being...  I need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious. \n[31]That's not what I said. \n[32]One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the next day she's the love of your life?   How is that serious? \n[33]Things change? \n[34]Things change? \n[35]Things change.   That's your explanation? Know what I think?   I think you banged your boss and fell in love, that's what I think. Some sorta mommy complex. \n[36]Excuse me?   I'm watching that. \n[37]Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you please move. The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself. \n[38]Stop looking at me like that! \n[39]Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey Paxton... Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the rest of the conversation. \n[40]My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head.   As you know, things have been a little crazy around here.   You should join me. \n[41]You closed minded southerners amuse me. Never willing to leave the nest and try     80. \n[42]Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle. Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents. \n[43]Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After a few moments, Margaret stops. \n[44]We're not done. \n[45]Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around. \n[46]I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased. \n[47]Thank you.  Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k... Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still painfully awkward.     81. \n[48]...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Geoffrey speeds up the dance. \n[49]Now you. \n[50]Chant. \n[51]Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the way.   You'll feel better. \n[52]Close your eyes.   Chant. Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes, but can't figure out what to say. \n[53]Chant! \n[54]Chant! \n[55]Chant! The drum beat continues. \n[56]Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything. Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing. \n[57]Don't make fun of my heritage!   And it was helping.   Don't you feel better?   I feel better. \n[58]Fine. With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end. \n[59]Come with me. \n[60]Not now.   C'mon. Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do. Geoffrey storms off and they follow. \n[61]I haven't told your mother about any of this, and I don't plan to.  I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside. \n[62]I called him yesterday.   He told me that you were lying, and that he was going to catch you.   That he was going to send you to prison. \n[63]You were making a mistake... \n[64]What are you doing, Richard? \n[65]What are you so God damn happy about? \n[66]What?! \n[67]Are you buying this horse shit? \n[68]Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I won't let you throw your life away for some woman. \n[69]Excuse me? \n[70]Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts. \n[71]Mom, are you OK? \n[72]Richard!   She has something she wants to say to us! Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through the oxygen mask. \n[73]I... I promise. \n[74]What... what is going on?  Did you fake a heart attack? \n[75]So, you know I think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right? \n[76]Good.  Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits for an answer. \n[77]Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something.   But that's what I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask you, \u00e2\u0080\u0098bout one of your planes... ", "GERTRUDE": "\n[1]Your dad made me come. \n[2]No.   I live here now. \n[3]I moved back about six months ago.   I'm teaching second grade.   At Baranof. \n[4]Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced. \n[5]Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.     39. \n[6]Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert. \n[7]A family name from hell. \n[8]Oh Please.   Ancient history. \n[9]So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight? \n[10]Is that a salmon down your pants? The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced. \n[11]They can be a little overwhelming, but they're great people. \n[12]Around the solstice they don't watch the clock.   Pretty much party \u00e2\u0080\u0098til they fall over. \n[13]I actually missed it when I was in the states. \n[14]Yeah.   Since college. \n[15]Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love it.   Think I'm back for good. \n[16]Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators? Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman. \n[17]Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I never thought I'd end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school. That was always Richard's plan. \n[18]No.   I was going to teach, he was going to run his dad's business.   He was like a little old man.   Had it all worked out. \n[19]What do you mean? \n[20]51. \n[21]Did he ever tell you why we broke up? \n[22]Oh.   Well I should shut up... \n[23]He proposed to me.   When we were seniors. Margaret laughs. \n[24]He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee.   It was so cute. \n[25]... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up with him on the spot. \n[26]After getting rejected the first time, I can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you. Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her. \n[27]Anyway.   The idea that my little old man could be a player...   It's just not the Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an honest man of him again.     52. Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off. \n[28]Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls. \n[29]Class, this is my old friend Richard. \n[30]Richard and I used to be in this very same classroom together.   We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher. \n[31]That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick. The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her. \n[32]Marcia? \n[33]OK, everyone is excused for recess. All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude. \n[34]It's still not a nice thing to say.   And actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and...  ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep that between us. \n[35]That was your fault. \n[36]You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend herself. \n[37]No Top Gun.   Please. \n[38]No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend. \n[39]Really.   Stop. \n[40]No.   Nothing's wrong. \n[41]I wish there was a better way to say this. \n[42]I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking up with you.   I'm sorry. \n[43]Yes. \n[44]This is something big. \n[45]I think...  I want you back. \n[46]Oh God, he's making me say it again.  I want you back.   Like... we should be together.   All the time. \n[47]I know this isn't the best time to bring this up. \n[48]I'm not talking about dating!   You should move back here.   We can have the life you always talked about in High School.   I'm ready for that now. \n[49]I know that the timing here sucks.   But we are meant to be together.   I know it.   I think you know it too... \n[50]Oh.   Hey Margaret. \n[51]Yeah.   See you at the wedding. \n[52]Promise. Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone. \n[53]So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a million questions for you tomorrow... Gertrude sits down next to Richard.     102. \n[54]...but for now I thought we'd just sit here and drink beer.   OK? Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer. \n[55]You have been practicing. \n[56]Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man whore down there. Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light. \n[57]You're gonna have to put that in check if you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are the only two real options up here... and I'll kick that bitch's ass. Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to joke.   Gertrude notices. \n[58]So no jokes yet?   Too soon? \n[59]That kiss didn't seem \"confused.\" Richard takes a beat to collect himself. \n[60]I don't know. \n[61]Find out what? \n[62]Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?  I guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile. \n[63]Uh-huh. Richard gets up. \n[64]I'm fine.   Really.   Go. Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.     104. ", "DEBBIE": "\n[1]So you're \"just dating,\" huh?   I can't believe you didn't tell us! \n[2]Annnie! \n[3]Oh, that man from the government.   Gilber- something.   Said he was checking up on you two.   Said it was technicality, because Margaret was from Canada. \n[4]Well for one thing, that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married! \n[5]Just that you were coming up here this weekend.   That we hadn't seen you in a while, and that we'd heard about Margaret for years, but that we'd never met her. Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands. \n[6]The way that Richard talked about you?   I'll admit, I didn't see this coming. \n[7]So why all the silly secrecy? \n[8]Well, is your family just anyone? \n[9]I should be mad at you two.   But, but... I'm just so excited! \n[10]Well you two... \n[11]When Gilber-something told us you were getting married... \n[12]...God rest their souls... \n[13]...we decided to give you a wedding. \n[14]...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight. Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks. \n[15]We've planned everything. Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher. \n[16]We'll show you around later. \n[17]Balzac!   Down!   No! Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small talk. \n[18]Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis. Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to illustrate how Balzac really got his name. Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel. \n[19]No one on the island wanted him when he was born.   We figured he deserved a home. \n[20]You'll be sleeping here. \n[21]Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you     33. \n[22]Oh, we took down his \"shrine\" years ago. And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that you two haven't slept in the same bed before.   Richard can sleep here too. \n[23]It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a great grandchild. Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother. \n[24]I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her old self. \n[25]He's just being a good host. Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard. \n[26]What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret. Margaret doesn't miss a beat.     41. \n[27]Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass. While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says \"I've got this under control\".   The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear. \n[28]Where's Margaret?   We need to go. \n[29]It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town. And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've planned everything. \n[30]Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my Balzac. \n[31]Work it Hank! \n[32]Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK? With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear or see the girls. Annie shakes her head.   Something is up. \n[33]And don't play dumb.   What did you do? Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.     53. \n[34]It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in bed.   Can I come in? \n[35]Well, it's your special day. Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement. \n[36]You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've got your dress fitting, have to get the house ready, and then your wedding. \n[37]Will you pick up some champagne while you're there? \n[38]And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of work to be done!     60. \n[39]Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of your life.   You are coming into this family, and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If your parents were with us, they would do the exact same. Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard jumps out of bed and goes to the food. \n[40]Geoffrey! Margaret stops chanting \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lil John. \n[41]He does this to keep in touch with \"his people\".     83. \n[42]Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and help us with this wedding. Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and the drum beat stops. \n[43]I am so excited.   Aren't you excited? \n[44]Come over here. Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.     84. \n[45]You're so beautiful, and such a great match for my Richard.   I know I've just met you, but a mother can tell.   When he looks at you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy I get to share your day. \n[46]You're right. Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again. \n[47]There you are!   You two almost gave me a heart attack.   C'mon, get dressed! \n[48]She violated you.   We should report her. \n[49]Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome. \n[50]What is going on, Richard? Richard slows down and explains to his mom. \n[51]But you already thought she was the one. \n[52]Really?   Does she think that too? \n[53]He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the airport! \n[54]He's not sure he's going to make it! \n[55]Oh, Geoffrey! ", "GRANDMA ANNIE": "\n[1]It's nice to meet you.   Now, do you prefer being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady? We've heard it both ways. Everyone laughs.     27. \n[2]It's not like he hasn't told her that he used to call her the Dragon Lady.   They're getting married. \n[3]Oh, we cancelled your reservation.   You're part of the family now.     Family doesn't stay at a hotel.   Also, we've got another little surprise for you two. \n[4]...you're getting married this weekend! \n[5]The whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says \"what are you talking about?\" \n[6]29. \n[7]...or friends... \n[8]Engagement party tonight... \n[9]Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good luck.   It's an Alaskan thing. \n[10]I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time left.   Richard lives so far away, and I never see him.   Now I find out he's getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up. The crowd cheers. \n[11]To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday.   Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at Richard. \n[12]Help him with the bags Geoffrey.  Let's get you two settled. As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots Geoffrey a look that says \"be nice\". \n[13]Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a story like this. \n[14]You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud.   I love you Richy. \n[15]Just sit there dear. \n[16]Ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years. No one has the heart to tell him to hang it up. \n[17]Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret.     46. \n[18]Is she singing about balls? \n[19]Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do this!  He's an eighth Tlingit, dear. \n[20]This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made it by hand.   Amazing how things come back into style.   How does it fit? Margaret speaks through the door. \n[21]Drum roll! Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds. Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except... \n[22]Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were. \n[23]Debbie, please.   We've got work to do. \n[24]You go work downstairs, I'll finish this. Debbie tries to calm down, but can't. \n[25]Go! Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go. \n[26]Had to get rid of her before I gave you this.   Don't think she woulda recovered. Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays on Margaret's neck. \n[27]You needed something blue.   It's silly, but I didn't want to take any chances. \n[28]It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue ones like this are very rare.   My great grandfather gave it to my great grandmother when they were married.   They were quite a scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she was Tlingit.      85. \n[29]Back then, you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married.   It almost broke them up. \n[30]Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did, none of us would be here if they hadn't. Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror. \n[31]I want you to have it. This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing from Annie. \n[32]I don't want to hear it.   It's yours. Grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like we'll always be a part of your life, even after we're gone. Take it. Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time feels like a complete and total fraud. \n[33]Are you feeling all right, dear? Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply. \n[34]Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk. \n[35]We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.     86. \n[36]If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is perfect. \n[37]Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes stink.   You ready? \n[38]Is that your song, dear? \n[39]It's me, Ramone. Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They whisper while they walk up to Ramone. \n[40]That's all we ever wanted. Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer. ", "HANDSOME MAN": "\n[1]You wrote it? \n[2]Well you did a good job.   It's great. \n[3]My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a lot for work.   I'll read anything... \n[4]OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But let's keep that between us. Margaret smiles and makes the \"my lips are sealed\" motion.   Just then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags. \n[5]Did you two want to sit together? \n[6]Your boyfriend? Margaret points to Richard indignantly. \n[7]You're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska? Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer. \n[8]You're awfully nice to fly him first class. Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard. \n[9]That's sweet. Richard goes over to the group.   Margaret keeps walking. \n[10]What kind of sick shit is this? Margaret nods.   This would be a tough one to explain. \n[11]Is this another gay assistant? Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat. \n[12]Do you really feel like you're alone?     112. \n[13]Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And you're under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible intoxication.     114. The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers. \n[14]Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need to get this unruly passenger off the plane ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain turn this bird around. There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes. \n[15]Told you I was a romantic. \n[16]Uh, sorry, but excuse us. The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson down the steps. ", "RAMONE": "\n[1]You are a naughty devil. Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns, Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies. \n[2]Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo. Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.     68. \n[3]Charged up, ready to go, number changed. Ramone throws Richard a phone. \n[4]No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back. Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay. Margaret is confused. \n[5]97. \n[6]Mi amo.  We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments.   To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word \"unselfish,\" but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. \n[7]...of Richard and Margaret's true love... \"True Love\" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices. \n[8]...before their family and friends. \"Family and Friends\" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated. \n[9]For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today.     98. \n[10]And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention. He's not sure what to do. \n[11]Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself. \n[12]Then why is your hand up? \n[13]Can it wait \u00e2\u0080\u0098til after? ", "ANNIE": "\n[1]We're not saying anything until you let us meet Margaret.   Now, where's our girl? Richard looks around.   Margaret keeps her head down and tries to avoid eye contact. \n[2]Why is Richard chopping wood? \n[3]Boys!   Stop it! Stop it!   Stop it! But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.   She grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth, causing a loud crash.   Geoffrey and Richard run over. \n[4]I'm having a... I need to go to the hospital.   Fast.     106. \n[5]Listen to me.   You two need to stop fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it.  Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if you don't agree with him. \n[6]And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family. \n[7]OK, then. Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.     107. Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th pilot. \n[8]I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go to the hospital.   Take us to the airport, please. Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even. \n[9]We didn't have time for your squabbling, and I knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport.   It seemed like the best way. \n[10]And remember, you two promised me that you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding about that. \n[11]Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your mother!

He doesn't do publicity. \n[6]But... \n[7]9. \n[8]\n[9]This is because I'm your competition. Because I threaten you! ", "FLIGHT ATTENDANT": "\n[1]Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me? Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson. \n[2]There's someone on the radio for you. The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at the front of the plane, outside the cockpit. \n[3]Uh, a Richard Paxton? Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt. \n[4]I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you. \n[5]Sir, you need to sit down. \n[6]Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your seat. Other passengers yell \"sit down asshole\" at Gilbertson. \n[7]Sir, this is your third and final warning! ", "IN THE BATHROOM": "\n[1]Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative hand towel.   Shit. \n[2]Margaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel. \n[3]Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting for her.   How did she miss that? \n[4]Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason. \n[5]Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat, ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then she spots the bathroom mat. \n[6]Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat. Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top. Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the door behind her and... ", "CHUCK": "\n[1]Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff. \n[2]Tower.   Talk to me. \n[3]Hey man.
