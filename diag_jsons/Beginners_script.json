Pop. What? \n[156]Prednisone makes you crazy. \n[157]Pop, you should rest. 10/29/07 48. \n[158]Nothing, you're pretty. \n[159]Yeah. \n[160]You're kidding right? \n[161]She did not. \n[162]This is what it looks like when Anna tells me about being Jewish in 2003. And when I tell her that my mother was Jewish. And then my father turned in his gay badge when my mother turned in her Jewish badge. And they got married in 1955. \n[163]My mother didn't know she was Jewish until she was 13. It was 1938. This is what people looked like. \n[164]And lions and giraffes. This man was Man of the Year. \n[165]Her father tried to hide that they were Jewish. This is the swim team that asked her to leave once they discovered that she was Jewish. \n[166]This is what pretty looked like in 1938. \n[167]My father realized he was gay when he was 13. It was 1938. \n[168]This is what pretty looked like. 10/29/07 50. \n[169]This is the only place my father could hide and have sex in the Fifties. \n[170]My father said if you got caught my the Vice Squad you could lose everything... This is everything. \n[171]My father laid down on a couch like this and told the psychiatrist all his problems in 1955. The doctor told him that homosexuality was a mental illness, but it could be cured. \n[172]Not everyone got cured. \n[173]This is where my parents lived in 1955. \n[174]And this is the home where the first gay rights group was secretly meeting. \n[175]While they were reciting their vows, here in this church... \n[176]Allen Ginsburg was writing his famous poem, Howl, blocks away in this room. \n[177]Yeah. Right. \n[178]Here, Pop. \n[179]I know, I know. Come on. \n[180]Alright. \n[181]But what about this chair?

You can't hide this from him. He loves you. \n[194]Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay? \n[195]He's that bad? \n[196]\n[197]Oui? \n[198]Oui Papa. \n[199]Doing what? \n[200]You should tell mom about that, not me. \n[201]Just as it was going so well. \n[202]Hey Anna? \n[203]How do you feel about vandalism? 10/29/07 58. \n[204]You okay? \n[205]Okay. \n[206]Yeah. \n[207]I'm trying to impress you. \n[208]Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. \n[209]Uh, do you mind? \n[210]Yeah. \n[211]Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick. \n[212]He did a lot of shopping. Bought all these books. \n[213]He was obsessed with Staples. \n[214]He bought a lot of plants. \n[215]He had a lot of parties. \n[216]I thought I was making dinner? \n[217]He had these political letter writing parties, there was an out gay congressman he was supporting... 10/29/07 63. \n[218]He started telling everyone that he was getting better. \n[219]Why're you telling them you're \"turning the corner\"? \n[220]You have stage 4 cancer? \n[221]Pop. There is no stage 5. \n[222]What does it mean? \n[223]What movie are we watching? \n[224]Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is. \n[225]He hired a secretary that he could dictate to. \n[226]You re-wrote Jesus' death? \n[227]Anna? \n[228]If this is too much, then we should just stop. \n[229]No! 10/29/07 67. \n[230]\n[231]\n[232]\n[233]He talks to you too? \n[234]Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes. \n[235]You okay?  You did really well. \n[236]humans going around and around. \n[237]If I leave him on his own, he loses all control. \n[238]Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car. \n[239]She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog. \n[240]You're gonna call the authorities? \n[241]Sorry, excuse us, sorry. \n[242]He shouldn't do this to you. \n[243]Your leaving soon? \n[244]I think you should come to my house and move in with me. \n[245]Yeah, a lot. \n[246]Yes . \n[247]But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now. \n[248]Cause I'm falling in love with you. \n[249]This is what the sun looks like and the stars. This is what it looks like when we eat. When we tell each other the stories in our heads. \n[250]I was born in 1965. Anna was born in 1971. This is what the sun looked like. Her pets. Her parents. She left home when she was 16. She lived here and here and here. \n[251]She had three serious relationships. She left all of them. I had four serious relationships. I left them too. Or let them fall apart. 10/29/07 72. \n[252]We didn't know how we learned the stories in our heads but sometimes they stop running and I can really see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears. Her feet. This is what it looks like when she says, I love you, in 2003. \n[253]This is what it looks like when she cries. When she tells me there's always a new empty room waiting for her. They used to make her feel free. Now they make her feel the opposite of free. \n[254]Next one. \n[255]Yeah, everyone knows that, here. \n[256]Everyone knows about that Pop. \n[257]No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love. \n[258]But you were gay that whole time. \n[259]For 44 years? \n[260]What about sex? You guys had sex? \n[261]And mom? You wanted mom too right? \n[262]Sex. \n[263]Life. \n[264]Healing. \n[265]Sunlight. 10/29/07 75. \n[266]\n[267]Spirit. \n[268]The first Gay Pride flag was made in 1978 by a man named Gilbert Baker. He gave a meaning to each color. \n[269]...'It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen to people who break easily... \n[270]...Generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. But these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'\" \n[271]Yeah? Is that a good idea? \n[272]This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. \n[273]Here, this could be your... \n[274]Your gonna need a big CD box. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet. \n[275]I'm sorry. \n[276]Well, that went well. \n[277]Come on Arthur. \n[278]This is the living room. \n[279]Dining room. \n[280]There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. \n[281]These're the stairs. \n[282]They go up. \n[283]I emptied these for you. I'll get your case. 10/29/07 79. \n[284]Are you okay? \n[285]Are you? \n[286]Why were you crying yesterday? \n[287]Yeah. \n[288]Well are you happy here? \n[289]I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. \n[290]I can barely remember you from when I was little. \n[291]Let's go home. \n[292]Let's go. \n[293]Anna? Where where you? \n[294]Hey. \n[295]You're going to take care of Elliott. I'll be back in a couple of days. Good luck. \n[296]Okay? Thanks. \n[297]Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. \n[298]You, you're in LA? \n[299]You said you were coming here?! \n[300]Fuck. I'm in your building. \n[301]Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here. \n[302]Maybe because I, I don't really believe that it's gonna work. And then I make sure it doesn't work. \n[303]Great. You look great. \n[304]Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag. \n[305]You will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card, phone account, utility, gym membership, every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes. \n[306]You will have all their mail forwarded to your address. You will write their obituary. You run it with a photo in the paper for two dollars a word. You will wonder if it's right. You'll throw a lot of their stuff away. You'll bring a lot of their stuff to your house. This is the photo my mother kept in her bedroom. \n[307]When I was a kid I thought that was my arm giving her daisies. Now I make a new mistake and think it's her arm giving me the daisies, saying, here, here's simple and happy. That's what I meant to give you. \n[308]Hey. \n[309]Arthur... \n[310]Thank you... Thanks. 10/29/07 92. \n[311]What? \n[312]No. No, it's because my father loved you so much. \n[313]Arthur... hey. Hey, how've you been? \n[314]Hey. \n[315]Come in, come in. \n[316]Yeah. \n[317]Sure. \n[318]Chest... \n[319]I like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff. \n[320]What happens now? \n[321]How does that work?

He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away. \n[97]It was so violent, we need new stories. \n[98]Again! \n[99]\n[100]\n[101]\n[102]Lord. \n[103]Here, that means gay pride. \n[104]No they don't. \n[105]Don't be ridiculous. \n[106]Did you know, about me? \n[107]We loved each other. \n[108]I learned how not to be. \n[109]I knew I was gay, though, at dinner parties I was looking at the husbands not the wives. 10/29/07 74. \n[110]I couldn't have survived if I didn't know that.
