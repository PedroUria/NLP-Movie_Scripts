Say \"girlfriends\". \n[5]Parker, you've so got this. \n[6]`Cause you're a girl. \n[7]He's not going for it. \n[8]Minimum. \n[9]She had to come skiing with us? \n[10]I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all. \n[11]I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with \n[12]For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes. \n[13]No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet. \n[14]It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything. \n[15]You did great. \n[16]I would have asked for change. \n[17]I would have definitely asked him for change. \n[18]I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. \"Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!\" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here. \n[19]\n[20]Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck. \n[21]Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board? \n[22]Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead. \n[23]Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer. \n[24]At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss. \n[25]\n[26]Oh no. She broke the rule. \n[27]Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights? \n[28]So it doesn't bother you when I do this? \n[29]Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers. \n[30]\n[31]\n[32]Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing. \n[33]\n[34]\n[35]Need some help? \n[36]Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help! \n[37]I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even \n[38]Yeah, I'm fine. \n[39]Joe. \n[40]I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass. \n[41]Seriously, that guy was such a dick. \n[42]Last one to the bottom is buying dinner! \n[43]\n[44]Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill \n[45]No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point. \n[46]-no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that. \n[47]Parker, I didn't not want you to come. \n[48]Exactly. Remember? I was like \"Hey man, why doesn't Parker come \n[49]What did you say?   You said chicken. \n[50]You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, \"Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing...\" \n[51]What? \n[52]Wait up. \n[53]Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky he didn't make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend's size. \n[54]No way. \n[55]Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes. \n[56]\n[57]Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or \n[58]Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen? \n[59]Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good. \n[60]Whew.   You! That's so like you! \n[61]Remember \"429\". \n[62]Just remember \"429\". \"5022\". \"5022.\" \"5022.\" \n[63]Hey man, do you have a pen? \n[64]Seriously. For a hundred bucks \n[65]Wachusett still has night skiing. \n[66]\n[67]There's a Papa Gino's on our way \n[68]\n[69]Don't you mean, \"baby\"? \n[70]\n[71]\n[72]I told you that? \n[73]Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan. \n[74]The chick on the Jaws poster was \n[75]I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot. \n[76]That's why I only swim in pools. \n[77]Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them. \n[78]But they say that when you jump \n[79]What? \n[80]Easy.   The Sarlaac pit. \n[81]The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever. \n[82]Shut-up. \n[83]This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and \n[84]Come on now! This is messed up. \n[85]I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie. \n[86]What did you say to the guy? \n[87]Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this. \n[88]This is so messed up. \n[89]Free lift tickets. \n[90]We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even \n[91]That makes two of us. \n[92]Well, what do you want me to do?   I gotta go. \n[93]It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway. \n[94]\n[95]\n[96]I'm pissing. \n[97]Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back. \n[98]There.   Much better. \n[99]\n[100]\n[101]\n[102]\n[103]What is this asshole doing? \n[104]Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the \n[105]OK, top 3 breakfast cereals of all time. Go. \n[106]I'll go first. \n[107]Crunch Berries... \n[108]\n[109]...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes. \n[110]There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right? \n[111]Top 3 celebrities you'd do. Me first again? Fine... \n[112]\n[113]Great. Best Christmas present you ever got? Go. \n[114]Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh? \n[115]\n[116]Dan...woah. Let's talk about this. \n[117]You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops? \n[118]Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't know. \n[119]\n[120]How are you going to find your way in the dark? \n[121]Walker, no. \n[122]Dan, say something.     Are you alright? \n[123]Oh, shit. \n[124]What are you doing? \n[125]You'll just get hurt, too.   Stop. Calm down. \n[126]OK. Alright. You gotta stay \n[127]If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK? \n[128]Buddy, can you move at all? \n[129]You can't, like...I don't know, slide down the hill or something? \n[130]Alright, alright. Um...? \n[131]Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down. \n[132]\n[133]Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing. \n[134]Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding. \n[135]Are you sure you can't try and get \n[136]Alright.   Hold on. \n[137]Maybe...if I could climb up to the lift cable? Maybe I could like, scale across to the other chairs until I find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground? \n[138]I can't even do a pull-up. \n[139]There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it. \n[140]Even if I made it across to the \n[141]OK. The chair that's two back. Does it look like it's near the pole? \n[142]Shit, that's far. \n[143]Just.   Just give me a second. \n[144]Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death. \n[145]Yeah, man. We didn't go anywhere. I think...I think I'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close enough, maybe... \n[146]It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now. \n[147]Just hold on to my legs. You can't really stop me from falling...but it's, you know...psychological or something you know? \n[148]OK...OK...just give me a second. \n[149]Us? Maybe. But not him. \n[150]Shh! \n[151]It's alright man. It's just a \n[152]Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England? \n[153]Wolves around here are pussies. They aren't even that big. \n[154]Parker- coming through with the \n[155]OK...here we go. \n[156]Holy shit, is that high up. \n[157]Nothing.   Just be quiet. \n[158]Please stop talking. \n[159]Woa-! The whole back of this thing is ice. \n[160]Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should \n[161]Are you alright man? \n[162]See? What did I tell you? They're more scared of you than you are of them. \n[163]It's just a dog. That's all it is. \n[164]No, no. You'll be alright. That's probably really bad. I gotta move, so I need you to- \n[165]Hey...go like this. \n[166]\n[167]Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere? \n[168]\n[169]I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. \n[170]Just try and cover your face.    Try and stay warm. \n[171]I'm trying man, I'm trying. \n[172]Stop talking. \n[173]\n[174]I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this. \n[175]\n[176]\n[177]Shh. \n[178]\n[179]Please no.     Please no... \n[180]Don't look down. \n[181]Don't look down there, Parker. \n[182]\n[183]\n[184]\n[185]I should...try and... \n[186]You can't be fucking serious. \n[187]He said he could do it. You didn't \n[188]You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him! \n[189]Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I \n[190]What?   Say it. \n[191]Say it!   It should have been me? \n[192]\n[193]You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass \n[194]\n[195]And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD! \n[196]-Fuck you. \n[197]I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Parker. \n[198]5...5...shit, what was it?    5520? 5020? \n[199]5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like \"Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?\" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve. \n[200]She will.    Shannon's got a great \n[201]\n[202]\n[203]429-5022. \n[204]I will. \n[205]Says who? \n[206]\n[207]No cats.    Just a dog.   Steve. \n[208]What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's? \n[209]She won't starve to death and you're not going to die. \n[210]The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine. \n[211]I know.   But you'll see her again. \n[212]I...thought I was dreaming.   This. I thought this was a dream. \n[213]Your frost-bite.   It's getting...worse. \n[214]Don't.    It's bad. \n[215]\n[216]They'll fix me, too then.   Just \n[217]\n[218]I don't know. Mountain maintenance. Besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us. \n[219]Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please! \n[220]\n[221]Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down. \n[222]Help me. \n[223]\n[224]If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you. \n[225]Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this. \n[226]Alright. \n[227]Hey...hey Parker... \n[228]Parker wake up. \n[229]Shit, I thought you stopped breathing... \n[230]Nothing. \n[231]How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here? \n[232]\n[233]I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight. \n[234]I have no strength. \n[235]Damn it. \n[236]What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength. \n[237]Even if it was a foot deeper- it \n[238]Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing. \n[239]How am I supposed to answer that? \n[240]I had a serious girlfriend once. \n[241]\n[242]This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I \n[243]She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates \n[244]Same old shit. No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named \"Dean\" had left her notes and shit. \n[245]I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention. \n[246]\n[247]I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life. So I left. \n[248]Yup. Told her to go laugh with \"Dean the Frat guy\". I was out. \n[249]Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I \n[250]I can't. She's dating Dean. \n[251]There was nothing either of us could have done. \n[252]\n[253]Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little... \n[254]Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass. \n[255]And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying \n[256]You have no idea. But then, the teacher... Mrs... What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. And so she \n[257]For a week! For my whole first week of school I'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass! \n[258]Douchebag.     I never let him forget it. \n[259]But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit. \n[260]So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this \n[261]Help me up. \n[262]\n[263]Rrruh! \n[264]Shit!    Hold on, just hold on! \n[265]Rrrugh! \n[266]\n[267]Got it. \n[268]Motherfucker. \n[269]I've got an audience. \n[270]No.    No it's not. \n[271]\n[272]Not yet.   Halfway. \n[273]Please. \n[274]Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way. \n[275]I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense. \n[276]\n[277]Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna get you home, OK? \n[278]Rrrrugh! \n[279]Shit. \n[280]\n[281]\n[282]\n[283]Yaaaaugh! \n[284]Rrrrugh! \n[285]\n[286]\n[287]\n[288]\n[289]Come on!     Try something, fucker! \n[290]\n[291]\n[292]\n[293]\n[294]Parker, I'm gonna go get help! Don't move and I'll be back as fast as I can! \n[295]Just don't move!     I'm getting help! ", "PARKER": "\n[1]Are you sure about this? \n[2]Is um... is that her? \n[3]-What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing. \n[4]Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid. \n[5]Why me? \n[6]My charming smile? \n[7]Hey. \n[8]Could I bum a smoke? \n[9]Thanks. \n[10]I'm Parker. \n[11]Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason. \n[12]Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid... \n[13]My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so... \n[14]No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know? \n[15]Like...fifty? \n[16]I did good, right? \n[17]There isn't any. \n[18]He wasn't going for it at 50. \n[19]\n[20]It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right? \n[21]Oh, now I'm \"baby\"?     You never call me pet names. \n[22]He calls me \"Parker.\" \n[23]Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like \"honey\" or \"sweetie\". \n[24]You don't touch my face enough either. \n[25]\n[26]\n[27]I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right? \n[28]You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts. \n[29]What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight. \n[30]\n[31]But, I haven't read a- \n[32]No. \n[33]Quit it! \n[34]I'm not afraid of heights.   I just \n[35]Points for calling me \"baby\" but you just made that statistic up. \n[36]\n[37]Why do I have to wear a helmet? \n[38]But you guys don't wear them. \n[39]I only see little kids wearing them. \n[40]You're just doing this to make fun of me. \n[41]Aww, check out Lynch. \n[42]Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom. \n[43]I know you are. \n[44]Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too. \n[45]You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go- \n[46]I told you I didn't have to come. \n[47]It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on \"guy time\". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages. \n[48]She does not. \n[49]I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today. \n[50]\n[51]What if we promise to run straight \n[52]Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number! \n[53]Nope. \n[54]I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving. \n[55]You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like, \n[56]Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real \n[57]Jesus! \n[58]Shit.   Do you hear that? \n[59]Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. I'm not even kidding. \n[60]Bur! \n[61]It's gonna start again, right? \n[62]That's not morbid. \n[63]She was? \n[64]I think burning to death would be the worst. \n[65]I remember watching TV for like 3 \n[66]OK, then Lynch. What is the worst \n[67]No, you have an answer for \n[68]The what? \n[69]\n[70]\n[71]No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here. \n[72]What if they don't start it again? \n[73]Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut \n[74]\n[75]Don't yell at me. \n[76]What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us. \n[77]No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday. Its fucking Sunday and they aren't \n[78]We're gonna die up here. \n[79]\n[80]\n[81]\n[82]\n[83]\n[84]Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!! \n[85]Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be. \n[86]I can hold it. \n[87]I can hold it. \n[88]Oh, thank God. \n[89]\n[90]Why isn't he stopping? \n[91]No!   No! \n[92]\n[93]My face is burning. \n[94]No it isn't. \n[95]Stop. \n[96]Please, stop. \n[97]Everyone went home.    They left us up here. \n[98]\n[99]\n[100]Shayna.   My puppy. \n[101]Shit! \n[102]Shut-up. \n[103]-what, what are you doing? \n[104]No.    No, don't leave me up here. \n[105]\n[106]No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt. \n[107]DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god! \n[108]Can you move? Dan? Hold on. Hold on, baby. \n[109]I gotta...I have to get to him. \n[110]Calm down?! Talk to me, Danny! \n[111]How bad is it? \n[112]\n[113]Can you stop the bleeding? \n[114]Here... \n[115]\n[116]Here, take my coat. \n[117]No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please- \n[118]Are you sure. \n[119]You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs? \n[120]I don't know. I can't see. \n[121]What if you fall, too? \n[122]Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here. \n[123]We're right here, baby. \n[124]Just hang in there, Dan.     It's gonna be OK. \n[125]What can I do to help? \n[126]I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours. \n[127]Baby, is that you? \n[128]It could be worse, right? \n[129]It could be the Sarlacc Pit. \n[130]\n[131]What?   What's wrong? \n[132]Oh shit! \n[133]\n[134]Are you keeping warm down there? \n[135]\n[136]What? \n[137]I don't..I can't see anything.    I \n[138]But it itches now... \n[139]Careful. \n[140]Don't look down. \n[141]Do you got it? \n[142]What's wrong? \n[143]I got you. \n[144]What's wrong? \n[145]What happened? \n[146]\n[147]Why did you let him jump? \n[148]It was too far. \n[149]\n[150]\n[151]But you... You should have... \n[152]I didn't say that. \n[153]No, no, I- \n[154]I'm sorry. \n[155]That's not fair! \n[156]I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm just- I'm just- \n[157]429... \n[158]5022. \n[159]Who's gonna pay for the house. \n[160]What does she do. \n[161]Orthodontists make a lot of money. \n[162]I bet you guys will be really happy. \n[163]Who names their dog \"Steve\". \n[164]Steve's a \"people\" name. \n[165]\n[166]\"Here, meet my cat Chris.\" \n[167]Shayna must be so hungry. \n[168]\n[169]No one else has a key to my place. \n[170]I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas. \n[171]Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. \n[172]It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again. It's the same routine every year. I just want to see my Mom and Dad. \n[173]Uhh... \n[174]Ruuugh! \n[175]Shhhh. \n[176]What? \n[177]Really?    How bad is it? \n[178]It's not as itchy any more. \n[179]You have some dark spots on your face, too. \n[180]For what? \n[181]No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead. \n[182]Besides.   No one knows we're here. \n[183]Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today? \n[184]I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute. \n[185]No.     I can't. \n[186]No. I'm fine. \n[187]\n[188]What's wrong? \n[189]Yeah. \n[190]It was all that pizza talk. \n[191]\n[192]Maybe later. \n[193]There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now. \n[194]What do you want me to do? \n[195]\n[196]How come you never have a girlfriend? \n[197]I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship. \n[198]High School doesn't count. \n[199]Who? \n[200]\n[201]So then... what happened? \n[202]Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous? \n[203]So she dumped you for a frat guy? \n[204]That's messed up. \n[205]You just walked out? \n[206]That sucks. \n[207]You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that. \n[208]I should have done something. \n[209]I sat here and let him die. \n[210]He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry. \n[211]Sounds like Dan. \n[212]And so he had to sit with you? \n[213]I loved him so much. \n[214]Yes. \n[215]Yes. \n[216]Are you OK? Do you have it? \n[217]Oh my god! \n[218]Joe!    JOE! \n[219]Please God...please God....please God... \n[220]You can do it. Please do it. \n[221]\n[222]The chair is gonna fall! \n[223]You made it! \n[224]What? \n[225]Oh shit. \n[226]Sorry. \n[227]Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall. \n[228]\n[229]\n[230]... \n[231]\n[232]\n[233]\n[234]Hurry.   Please. \n[235]\n[236]\n[237]\n[238]Lynch. \n[239]\n[240]Joe...? \n[241]Please.   Stop. ", "DAN": "\n[1]The shift change is late.   Just wait. \n[2]We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it. \n[3]Shit. \n[4]It's cool, it's cool. Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him- \n[5]Parker, listen, listen. It's so \n[6]-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets. \n[7]Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me. \n[8]You've got this.    You can totally do this. \n[9]The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no. \n[10]A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. Just... \n[11]There. \n[12]Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it? \n[13]-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more. \n[14]You said you didn't mind? \n[15]\n[16]Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you... \n[17]She's getting better. Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem. \n[18]Good work!     See?   They always go for it. \n[19]Oh, so where's my change? \n[20]You gave him the full hundred? \n[21]\n[22]Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby. \n[23]I'm just not a `pet name' guy. \n[24]It's your name. \n[25]See? At least I don't call you \"O'Neil\". \n[26]Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. Sweetie. \n[27]You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike. \n[28]Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board? \n[29]That's what they said about rap. \n[30]Used floss? Where do you come up with this shit. \n[31]No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you? \n[32]Gimme a drag. \n[33]No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this \n[34]It's alright. \n[35]Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off \n[36]Actually, I paid good money. \n[37]Safety first. \n[38]\n[39]No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet. \n[40]\n[41]I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it. \n[42]I'm tough. \n[43]\n[44]We gotta take a weekend trip up \n[45]Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like \n[46]Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few. \n[47]It was his idea that we invited you in the first place. \n[48]-I was like, \"OK that would be cool\". \n[49]No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell. \n[50]Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom \n[51]She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer. \n[52]\n[53]But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs! \n[54]\n[55]What? \n[56]Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have. \n[57]Wicked fast. \n[58]We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind! \n[59]I know right? They're supposed to \n[60]\"429\". \n[61]What did He-Man have to say about that? \n[62]Why didn't you have some pizza? \n[63]Check it out! \n[64]We are so hitting that jump. \n[65]It's just wind, Parker. \n[66]Who invited you? \n[67]It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax. \n[68]Oh, come on. \n[69]\n[70]\"Get off me, you're crushing my \n[71]What do you think the worst way to die would be? \n[72]I think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go. Not if it was like one of those \n[73]But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. That would be worse than actually \n[74]\"I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!\" \n[75]Give it a minute. \n[76]\n[77]Are they fucking kidding? \n[78]\n[79]No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now. \n[80]\n[81]Will you stop?! \n[82]Me?   Nothing! \n[83]I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here. \n[84]They just lost power or something. \n[85]It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to. \n[86]Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out. \n[87]I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night? \n[88]We won't be stuck here all night. \n[89]It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it. \n[90]Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this. \n[91]\n[92]Then how are you going to piss? \n[93]\n[94]I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the \n[95]Put the safety bar down, Joe. \n[96]Put the bar down. \n[97]\n[98]What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO- \n[99]\n[100]The power is coming back on soon. \n[101]It has to. \n[102]Anyone know what time it is?    I \n[103]Dude, quit it. \n[104]Someone has to jump. \n[105]We can't just sit up here until next weekend. We'll die. \n[106]Shhh.   It's OK. \n[107]You're not gonna die, baby. I \n[108]It's alright. It's alright. \n[109]Hey.    It's snowing. \n[110]Disneyworld in 8th grade. \n[111]I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help. \n[112]Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite. \n[113]I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you. \n[114]Do you have a better idea? I'm telling you, I've totally jumped off of a lift before. \n[115]\n[116]I can do this. \n[117]I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom. \n[118]\n[119]One. \n[120]...Two. \n[121]Remember when I was saying how I jumped off one of these things before? \n[122]I totally lied. I'm scared shitless right now. \n[123]\n[124]\n[125]My legs.    I broke my fucking legs. \n[126]Stay there. Don't get off the \n[127]It's bad. It's really fucking bad. \n[128]I can't even stand up. \n[129]My legs are shattered, asshole! I'm bleeding to death- NO, I CAN'T \n[130]...so much blood. \n[131]With what? \n[132]I can't see. \n[133]What do I do with this? \n[134]I'm so cold. \n[135]No! Don't you take off your coat! \n[136]-Parker, keep your coat on. \n[137]Shit! \n[138]I...I've got it. \n[139]Yup. \n[140]\n[141]You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole.

Please do it now. \n[146]What? \n[147]Oh, motherfucker. \n[148]\n[149]I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. \n[150]How the hell...could this be worse? \n[151]You can do this, Lynch.     You've got it. \n[152]You guys. \n[153]\n[154]There's a wolf down here. \n[155]\n[156]\n[157]\n[158]I don't know.

The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air. \n[4]\n[5]\n[6]Parker you just broke the first rule. \n[7]don't like them. \n[8]He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame. \n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them. \n[13]\n[14]\n[15]Parker and Dan are beaming at him.   He knows he's beat. \n[16]\n[17]\n[18]Come on, just one more run. \n[19]you'd think he could cut us some slack. \n[20]\n[21]`roller skating rink birthday party pizza'. \n[22]HEYMAN  runs by him on his way to the lodge. \n[23]Nothing. He sighs. Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few \n[24]\n[25]\n[26]days straight after 9/11. That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside \n[27]Why hasn't it started again? \n[28]\n[29]off the lights and scare the customers? \n[30]\n[31]\n[32]For a whole week? \n[33]Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them. \"Ping-ing\" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces. The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather. \n[34]\n[35]\n[36]Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a halt. The three kids cheer. \n[37]inches. Desperately, Lynch throws his goggles at the Snow Cat. They land just shy of the driver's side window. \n[38]\n[39]Apple Jacks... \n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]You don't get a fresher run than this, right? \n[44]You're gonna be OK, baby. \n[45]\n[46]strong for me, Parker. Can you do that? \n[47]\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]\n[51]Maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know? \n[52]\n[53]\n[54]\n[55]\n[56]\n[57]Yeah.   I'm alive. \n[58]\n[59]You gotta move faster up there. \n[60]\n[61]\n[62]\n[63]Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo through the night. The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and \n[64]\n[65]But you want to! It's OK. I get it. It should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right? \n[66]chest, letting it all out. Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her.    He puts his arm around her. \n[67]job. \n[68]You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say \"Here's my dog Steve.\" \n[69]\n[70]The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness. Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls... \n[71]\n[72]\n[73]\n[74]\n[75]\n[76]onto the ground. Lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as Parker holds him steady. \n[77]wouldn't break that fall. I should have just climbed across last night. I had strength. I had adrenaline. \n[78]\n[79]\n[80]screwed up. \n[81]\n[82]\n[83]\n[84]Arrrrr! \n[85]Take that Jenny Bluth! \n[86]Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right? Shit. \n[87]\n[88]\n[89]\n[90]A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth. \n[91]Parker sobs. \n[92]\n[93]\n[94]She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years. Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath \n[95]BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers blaring. Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road. There are no more cars to be seen. She is alone. \n[96]", "R": "\n[1]us since last semester.

Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right. \n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]Are you gonna be here next weekend? \n[17]\n[18]\n[19]stay open until 10 on Sundays.

Do me a solid? \n[23]minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him. A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio. \n[24]Yes. Anyone got any jokes? \n[25]surfers where they get hit from behind and they don't even know what happened. You know. Cause it like came up \n[26]to know that jumping was a better way out? \n[27]\n[28]\n[29]I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second. They didn't go home. That's retarded. \n[30]\n[31]I have to pee. \n[32]Sorry. She's the one who said we'd be here for \"a week\"! \n[33]Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder. \n[34]Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them. Dan's head snaps up. \n[35]\n[36]\n[37]Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down. \n[38]Finally. \n[39]\n[40]I don't want to die up here. \n[41]\n[42]Don't leave me. \n[43]\n[44]we drop  from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below. \n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n[48]\n[49]Moments pass with only their breathing. \n[50]You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it. \n[51]What's going on up there?     You guys? \n[52]\n[53]Lynch tries to control the panic. \n[54]\n[55]protection. \n[56]Dan doesn't take his eyes off of the wolf.      He is shaking in fear. \n[57]\n[58]Ow!   It feels like...like sunburn. \n[59]\n[60]Slippery. \n[61]\n[62]\n[63]bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below. Dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony. \n[64]\n[65]\n[66]\n[67]Lynch makes something up...but continues to have no expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered. \n[68]Why not?    Steve's a good name for a dog. \n[69]And so will you. So will we. \n[70]\n[71]\n[72]Just don't touch your face, OK? When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it. \n[73]\n[74]\n[75]Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing. It appears she is not. \n[76]\n[77]\n[78]No, post-high school.   Freshmen year. \n[79]No. I dumped her. We were in the cafeteria, right? And I was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. And I \n[80]\n[81]like a total pussy. \n[82]for Dan. Alright? \n[83]\n[84]\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD into the snow. \n[89]\n[90]The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill. \n[91]\n[92]The morning sun hits Parker's pale face.   Is she dead? Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the night. She looks to the tree-line around her. \n[93]\n[94]the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an unnatural angle. Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it. \n[95]She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. Parker and the pack leader lock eyes. Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food. Back to his family. Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side. She is free.

It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame. Hey, you remember the numbers I told you? \n[20]\n[21]pizza myself. \n[22]\n[23]Last chair is through. \n[24]What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity? \n[25]from beneath them.

It was like- \"move her to the side and keep the line going people\". But no. They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to- \n[28]\n[29]\n[30]open again until Friday. We'll be stuck here all week. \n[31]I have to pee wicked bad. \n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]look like it's going to stop. \n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]won't let you die. OK?

We're gonna die up here. \n[47]She takes off her scarf and tosses it below. It blows away into the trees.       It doesn't even make it halfway. \n[48]\n[49]down the hill, buddy? \n[50]next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground? \n[51]\n[52]\n[53]coyote or something.

Only Lynch and Parker's faces. After what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from below begin to dissipate. Eventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away. \n[64]try and stop him! I can't believe this?! You're blaming me? \n[65]\n[66]\n[67]She...an orthodontist. \n[68]\n[69]\n[70]\n[71]\n[72]\n[73]\n[74]\n[75]\n[76]Parker holds onto his legs tightly. \n[77]She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes.     The box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry. She starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack. \n[78]\n[79]kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. So I was like, \"who are you laughing at?\" You know? Like \"what the hell is going on?\" And she's like, \"Dean's making fun of \n[80]\n[81]\n[82]Lynch bites his severely chapped lips. \n[83]\n[84]\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]Oooof! \n[89]\n[90]\n[91]his body on top of it. Pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill. \n[92]The sun is coming up. She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise. \n[93]\n[94]She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can. \n[95]All that she can do is clutch the ground. And then... Another car approaches in the distance. She holds her hand up weakly.

The lights go out. \n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me I'm gonna puke. \n[32]I'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing. \n[33]\n[34]bottom. It's headlights shine across the trees in front of it. \n[35]Panic sets in yet again. \n[36]It's nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so you're gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side. \n[37]Though we can briefly see the light shine off of the three kids, unless you knew they were there or were looking for them...you would have missed them, too. As the windshield turns the other way, one of Lynch's skis slams into the ground, just out of the headlight's view. \n[38]\n[39]\n[40]I'm so scared. \n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]\n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n[48]You need it! \n[49]No, man.   I can't move.   I can't move. \n[50]ladder on it. \n[51]maybe I can jump to it. \n[52]\n[53]That sounded like a fucking wolf. \n[54]\n[55]Dan takes his gloves away from his face...only to freeze in horror. Not even 10 feet away, stands a WOLF. Silently the wolf watches him from the bushes.   Lightly growling. \n[56]\n[57]He won't be back. \n[58]\n[59]\n[60]\n[61]What? \n[62]\n[63]Silence once again. Finally, Lynch let's go of Parker's head. He sobs into his own frozen gloves as Parker hysterically screams out into the night. \n[64]I'm not...I'm not blaming you. \n[65]we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home! \n[66]\n[67]Yup. \n[68]\n[69]\n[70]together, but neither is moving. In fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles. The dark splotches of frost-bite on Parker's nose and cheeks have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black fungus on her skin. \n[71]\n[72]don't touch it. \n[73]\n[74]An empty lodge. An empty parking lot. A still chair lift. All covered in white, still snow. \n[75]Nothing. \n[76]\n[77]\n[78]totally just felt it with her, you know? We were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. She was way into Aerosmith. I had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. How cool is that? \n[79]you.\" So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my \n[80]\n[81]says, \"Well Dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know?\" You know, like, \"Maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with?\" And the fucker points right at me and says \"him\"! I had never seen this kid before in my life, you know? But for whatever reason, he \n[82]\n[83]\n[84]\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]waits. \n[89]through it. He moves quickly back up to the area underneath the middle chair. The leader growls. Drool drips down from beneath it's hungry mouth as it takes a step back. \n[90]\n[91]\n[92]\n[93]\n[94]", "D": "\n[1]\n[2]So what happened to the other fifty numbers in between there? Like, I don't know, $51 or maybe even $75? \n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]Cause they're still learning, too. Come on, I'm not gonna argue about this. \n[9]See?   Chick magnet. \n[10]I'm Shannon, by the way. \n[11]Finally, Parker comes to a stop on her own next to Dan and he claps for her. \n[12]all day but do you think we could get one real run in before we leave tonight? \n[13]with us?\" And you were like- \n[14]\n[15]the lift line. \n[16]\n[17]\n[18]down. Like the quickest run ever. \n[19]\n[20]Rifkin takes his place. \n[21]Last run. Gotta make it count. \n[22]A low, distant thunder roll echoes far away. \n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]everything. What's your biggest fear? \n[27]\n[28]What if everyone went home? \n[29]We need to get down from here. We can't just sit up here. Why isn't the goddamn chair moving, Dan? What the hell?! \n[30]if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here- we can jump. I see people jump off of chair lifts all the time. \n[31]How am I supposed to go? \n[32]\n[33]\n[34]Dan begins to cheer. \n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]don't wear a watch. \n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]If we can wait `til morning I bet someone will come up here. Like a snow groomer or some shit. \n[43]\n[44]Parker calls down to him. \n[45]chair. \n[46]\n[47]\n[48]\n[49]Lynch holds his head. \n[50]\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\n[54]\n[55]\n[56]\n[57]\n[58]don't know, it's too dark \n[59]\n[60]\n[61]them...we reveal Dan splayed out on the ground below. Out of the darkness of the bushes...a pack of SIX WOLVES slowly and silently descends on him from all angles. \n[62]Lynch holds her head in a vice grip. He presses his forehead into hers. Her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves. \n[63]\n[64]He wasn't going to listen to me. \n[65]You're sorry? Maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing... maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life... maybe my best friend \n[66]They only speak to be speaking. \n[67]\n[68]\n[69]I want to see my Mom and my Dad. I want to open presents in the morning and then wait for my grandmother to show up so we can \n[70]Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and nose. Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens. \n[71]\n[72]Well, it's morning. Maybe someone will come up here now. \n[73]\n[74]\n[75]What? \n[76]Then don't do this. \n[77]\n[78]What happened? \n[79]girlfriend...but I couldn't see him. \n[80]\n[81]points right at me. \n[82]OK....let's try this again. \n[83]\n[84]\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]towards Lynch's body. One step at a time. \n[89]\n[90]Lynch tries to fight off the wolf with his free arm. Finally, he is able to plunge the ski pole deep into the wolf's body. \n[91]heard now. Parker sobs quietly to herself. \n[92]She raises the safety bar. There is no more time to think. \n[93]\n[94]As she makes her way she spots a tree... with bright red blood splayed out in the snow around it. Cautiously she slows herself down. ", "E": "\n[1]\n[2]You gave me two 50's. What was I supposed to do, ask for change? \n[3]\n[4]Aww! \n[5]Have you ever sniffed your floss? It's nasty. \n[6]\n[7]\n[8]Even extreme boarders wear helmets. Nobody makes fun of them. \n[9]\n[10]\n[11]Look at you! See?   Having fun? \n[12]\n[13]\n[14]Hell yes, I said chicken, but that's not the point. The point is you can go a few more hours without hearing from Annette. \n[15]\n[16]something? That way I'll...know how to catch up with you and stuff. \n[17]You're only open three days a week. You can't afford to close early. \n[18]\n[19]That guy? Who cares? Steroids shrink your dick. Wait, shit. What were my four numbers? \"5022\". Parker, will you remember \"5022\"? \n[20]As Jason runs away he turns back. \n[21]\n[22]\n[23]white noise of the motorized cables goes away, leaving them in silence. The wind blows hard against them. \n[24]light of converging white strings. Even in this darkness, the menacing clouds are visible over the trees. \n[25]getting eaten. Knowing that this animal is coming for you but you can't get away. And that it's going to eat you. Like you're gonna get eaten alive? Have you guys ever seen that footage of the great white jumping out of the water to eat that seal? \n[26]\n[27]At first no one can speak. Dan reacts first. \n[28]They didn't go home. Stop freaking me out. Remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. This is horse shit. \n[29]\n[30]\n[31]Well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you. \n[32]mountain. That's so nasty. \n[33]Lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from Dan. The hail/sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence. Another loud thunder clap hits.   This time, much closer. \n[34]\n[35]STEVE  concentrates on the path.   The roar of his engine is almost deafening. His radio chimes in. \n[36]10-4. \n[37]Lynch throws one of his ski poles but doesn't even come close. Parker sobs hysterically. \n[38]locker real quick and I'll find out. \n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]Really?   And why would they come groom the snow on a day when they aren't open, Joe? A day when they still have a full work week before they open again? \n[43]\n[44]Dan's cries turn to quiet breaths below them. It is tough for Parker and Lynch to make out what exactly is happening. \n[45]Dan can see that his legs are shattered and that he is bleeding. Bone protrudes from his bloody ski pants. \n[46]\n[47]Just feel for it, OK?       Here it comes... \n[48]Dan takes off his snowboarding gloves and ties the elastic strings together. His fingers are so numb that it takes several tries. Once tied, he tries to stretch the gloves around his left knee, but it is useless. \n[49]Once again, Lynch starts looking all around.   Above, below. \n[50]\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]is becoming. \n[54]What can I do? \n[55]\n[56]THWOCK! Parker's snowboard comes down and skids away into the trees, pushing the wolf further back. The wolf darts back into the bushes. Though it can no longer be seen, we can hear it moving away through the brush and back into the darkness. Growls come from the surrounding bushes as the wolf angrily retreats. \n[57]I can't feel my legs anymore. Is that bad? I mean, it doesn't hurt as much...but that's bad right? \n[58]No!   Stop touching it.   Don't touch it. \n[59]\n[60]Oh god. \n[61]\n[62]Shhhh. Don't listen to it.        Don't listen. Don't listen. \n[63]in the distance, birds take off in fear. \n[64]said it was too far a drop! But I didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it! Don't you fucking blame me! You've been his girlfriend, for what? A year maybe? I've known him my whole fucking life! \n[65]wouldn't be dead right now! \n[66]\n[67]of food\" on the chair high above. Another wolf lays down in the snow by a tree. They wait like vultures. \n[68]The poor thing. She's just a puppy. She won't understand that I died. She's gonna think I left her. That I forgot about her. All she wants is for me to come home. She's probably waiting by the door for me right now. Every sound she hears in the hallway she's probably cocking her little head to the side, waiting to see if I'm going to walk in. But I won't. I won't ever walk in. And Shayna's going to starve to death. The poor thing is gonna wither away and die waiting by the door for me and it's all my fault. \n[69]eat. She's always late. But she brings all of the desserts. And she makes this special hot apple cider thing with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's so good. And after dinner my Dad always passes out on the couch `cause it's his one day off and he's had too much eggnog. And my sister, my Mom, and I watch A Christmas Story until the marathon is over. And that's how you know Christmas is really over. When Ralphie gets his Red Rider carbine-action two-hundred-shot range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming. \n[70]Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in. She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar. She pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal. Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar up about half an inch with it. \n[71]\n[72]\n[73]\n[74]Lynch is sleeping. His head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had. Parker is ancy.    She looks all around.   Thinking. Finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed. Her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. Slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and Lynch. Below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears. Parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears. She is emotionally degraded and devastated. As her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it. She doesn't even feel it. \n[75]He notices her skinned cheek.    Her ear tips are now completely blackened. \n[76]\n[77]\n[78]and that stuff you read about. \n[79]\n[80]No, you didn't. We didn't let him die. There was nothing we could have done. He jumped down there to try and save us, OK? \n[81]\n[82]metal is bending with a light squeaking sound. \n[83]\n[84]\n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]\n[89]The wolf leader advances on Lynch. Lynch makes it to the ski pole just in time and brandishes it defensively at the creature. \n[90]The wolf SHRIEKS in pain and scampers away towards the safety of the pack. The impending wolves, stop their slow march and wait.   This food still has some fight left in it. \n[91]\n[92]She is going to die one way or another. Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the chair. Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side. CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap. Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair. RRRRRUUUUUURRR! A gust of wind pushes against the chair, straining the arm. \n[93]\n[94]", "SHANNON": "\n[1]Do you think? \n[2]Ryan, what the hell? \n[3]No he didn't. I can take care of myself! \n[4]I am so sorry about that. He can \n[5]\n[6]Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that. \n[7]Well it was nice to meet you. \n[8]Joe! \n[9]Hey.
