{"dialogues": {"BEN": "\n[1]Things end, Caroline. That's just a part of life. It's how we deal with things ending that's important. \n[2]Well, he did take out a restraining order against you. I have to be honest, that's usually not a good sign. \n[3]Well, Caroline, I think the first thing you have to do... ... is stop whining about this pathetic loser! You're a tragedy queen! 'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives a shit! Get a fucking life! You are, without a doubt, the most boring human being I have ever met! Please, say something interesting before I lapse into a goddamn coma! \n[4]Lost in his fantasy, not really listening.    He comes to attention and tries to cover. \n[5]Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting on your whole -- situation. It's very interesting what you were just saying. I want you to think about it, and I'm going to think about it, so we'll both think about it and we'll continue next week when I get back from my vacation. \n[6]Or not. \n[7]I know. I couldn't get rid of my last patient. I think she was a tick in a past life. \n[8]Michael! What did I tell you? You can't listen to my sessions! It's private stuff. \n[9]Funny how that happens when you lie on the floor and put your ear up against it. \n[10]Fine. He moved up to striped bass. Put on your cummerbund. Boy, have you grown. Did your mother move next door to a nuclear power plant? \n[11]We have to dress up because Grandpa can't have a good time unless everyone else is extremely uncomfortable. Forget the tux. Regular clothes. \n[12]Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff? \n[13]She's not supposed to do that, you know. \n[14]Your mother and I, when we got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't put you in the middle, or use you as a go-between to talk about each other. So just do me a favor and tell your mother to shut her big mouth. Did she say anything about me getting married again? I think she could be feeling a little anger about it. \n[15]Okay. Listen, for two seconds, pretend I'm not your father. I'm just some guy, okay? \n[16]Yeah. I hate her! I really hate her! Okay. Dad again. Let's go. \n[17]Look at this. Everybody's nuts. Ooh, I hate walking into that house late. \n[18]No. Don't. I'm not going to be analyzed by someone who up until a few years ago believed in Santa. Sorry, but we only have room for one Dr. Sobol in this family. \n[19]Can we talk about something else? \n[20]Does your mother talk about anything else or is it just me twenty-four hours a day? \n[21]That's your mother's fault!   Your mother did that! Damn! \n[22]I'm sorry.   It's totally my fault. \n[23]I was talking to my son.   I took my eyes off the road -- \n[24]Well, I should have been watching. Let me give you my insurance information -- \n[25]Really? It looks like your whole rear end might be screwed up. \n[26]Maybe we should call the police? \n[27]Right!   Fuck 'em. \n[28]At least take my card. You might look at the damage in the morning and change your mind. \n[29]Ph.D.    Psychologist. \n[30]What do you mean you're not coming? It's my wedding. \n[31]Every time? This is a once-in-a- -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing. \n[32]Dad, you're not coming to my wedding? \n[33]Yeah, that's the word on the street. The self-help book business is full of vindictive pricks. \n[34]I'm sorry, but I've been alone for eight years, now I've finally met someone I want to spend the rest of my life with and I would really like you to meet her before we get married. You're going to be her family. I think it's better she knows that up front. \n[35]I'm joking. \n[36]The mayor's here? \n[37]Nothing.   Everything's fine. \n[38]It's great. Just great. I've got some very interesting patients -- extremely interesting. Fascinating actually. \n[39]Thanks, Mike. \n[40]I'm just not sure I could spend my life dealing with people whose biggest crisis is how to fire the maid. \n[41]Trout! And don't minimize my practice. \n[42]You always turn it back on me. Why do you do that? \n[43]Why do you think I think you do that? Go ahead, now you ask me why I think you think I think you do that. \n[44]Thomas Wolfe was right. You can't go home again -- because your parents still live there. \n[45]Carl, I'm detecting a pattern here. You seem to settle too easily for things. \n[46]No, well, there you go. You just did it again. I suggested something and you immediately agreed. \n[47]Why do you think you do that? \n[48]Well, sometimes people do it because they fear rejection or disapproval, but you can't let that worry you, Carl. And you can't agree with things just for the sake of agreeing. Stand your ground. Don't let people roll over you. \n[49]Excuse me!    I'm in a session here. \n[50]You're... You're one of the guys I rear-ended the other night. \n[51]What are you doing? \n[52]The hell he is. He's not going anywhere until we're done with his session. \n[53]Don't take it, Carl. \n[54]He's not leaving. \n[55]Listen, if you're upset about your car, I can understand that. But you don't just barge in here -- \n[56]Yes. \n[57]Okay. \n[58]Yes.    And no.    Sometimes.   Never. \n[59]Sure. \n[60]Yeah.   He's my favorite. \n[61]Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy my insurance information, but he wouldn't take it. Seriously, I tried several times because it was all my please don't kill me. \n[62]Yes.   Big Yankee fan. \n[63]Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your fault, but your friend, he interrupted a patient's session and that's -- not good. I think this is a matter for our insurance companies, don't you think? \n[64]Then what -- ? \n[65]Whatever makes you comfortable. \n[66]I won't discuss a patient with anyone for any reason, unless I know the patient may be a danger to himself. Like if I'm concerned a patient might kill himself... \n[67]-- or kill someone else. \n[68]Why don't you tell me why you think you need therapy? \n[69]Right.   I'm sorry. \n[70]I'm very sorry. \n[71]Why don't you tell me about your friend? \n[72]Panic attacks. \n[73]Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing -- chest pain attacks. \n[74]I'm going to go out on a limb here. I think your friend is you. \n[75]Medication could help, but if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you're going to want to get some kind of therapy. \n[76]With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd have to look at my schedule. I'm very heavily booked right now and I'm going on a short vacation tomorrow. \n[77]I don't really share that information with... \n[78]Miami Beach. \n[79]Well, I really didn't do anything -- \n[80]Could we define 'fag,' because some feelings may come up -- \n[81]Yes. \n[82]I hope you didn't leave any food in your room. I don't want to come home and find a science fair. \n[83]Yeah? \n[84]Michael! That's it!      I am sealing that vent. \n[85]I didn't ask to see his Mafia decoder ring, but yeah, it was him. And you cannot tell anyone he was here. You understand? \n[86]What? \n[87]Hi, everybody. \n[88]I missed you too. Michael, say hello. \n[89]Mike, you want to go look at the camera? \n[90]'Cause I bet there's all kinds of cool video stuff over there. Why don't you check it out? \n[91]Michael?   He's crazy about you.   I am too. \n[92]Of course. \n[93]That's not going to be us. \n[94]Yes, I'm brimming with passion. I'm up to here with passion. \n[95]The sweating shouldn't be a problem. The tearing sounds painful. \n[96]Mom? \n[97]I did nothing? What did you expect? I saw you for five minutes. I don't work miracles, Mr. Vitti. And I'll tell you something else. I don't appreciate it when someone breaks into my hotel room and kidnaps me. I don't go for that. I have a family and a life and a serious practice, and I don't have time for your bullshit! That got away from me near the end. \n[98]You mean sexually? \n[99]You flew fifteen hundred miles and dragged me out of bed in the middle of the night because you couldn't get an erection? \n[100]You can take a pill for that, you know. \n[101]Did you see that embroidered on a pillow somewhere? \n[102]I don't believe this. All right. Has this happened before? \n[103]So twice? \n[104]Listen, being unable to perform three or four times -- \n[105]Five times -- it isn't the end of the world. \n[106]Okay. \n[107]What happens next week? \n[108]It's impossible. I can't do anything that fast. And even if I could, what's my goal here? To make you a happy, well-adjusted gangster? \n[109]I'm sorry.   I can't help you. \n[110]Mr. Vitti, when I got into family therapy, this was not the family I had in mind. I'm turning you down. \n[111]I'd like to go now. \n[112]All right. What happened with your wife tonight? \n[113]You have a girlfriend? We could do two months on that alone. \n[114]Okay. Do you have marriage problems? \n[115]Then why do you have a girlfriend? \n[116]Why can't you do those things with your wife? \n[117]Okay, okay. Have you been under a lot of stress lately? \n[118]Well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, I'd say that's probably it then. \n[119]I doubt if there's anything physically wrong with you. \n[120]There's a lot more to it -- \n[121]Well, I didn't need to know that. \n[122]I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with -- \n[123]You don't hear the word 'no' that often, do you? \n[124]All right. I'm here for two more days. When we get back to New York, I'll treat you exclusively for two weeks. I just need to figure out what to tell my other patients. \n[125]No thanks, I'll handle it.   Now can I go? \n[126]Okay, listen. I'm going to tell you the truth. I had a serious patient emergency. \n[127]Just one. He followed me here from New York. I had to go. \n[128]Paul Vitti! Paul Vitti. \n[129]I know.    But don't worry. It's not like   he's a real patient. He's got   this idea in his head that I'm   helping him. It's crazy. \n[130]No. \n[131]I'm not! \n[132]Listen, it's been taken care of. I told him I couldn't see him again. He understood and it's over. \n[133]I don't understand. They jump out of the water, they splash, they eat fish. It's not a real stretch for a whale. If they did a number from West Side Story, then I'd be into it. \n[134]You've got to admire the openness. \n[135]I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm going to get a hot dog. Who wants a hot dog? \n[136]No, I'll go. You're pretending to have a good time. I don't want to spoil that. Be right back. \n[137]What is this?    Are you guys following me? \n[138]Is this a joke? \n[139]No, he and I discussed this. I told him I'd see him when I got got back to New York. \n[140]No, I'm not going, and if you bother me again I won't treat him at all. Understand? That's it. End of story. \n[141]They threw me in the shark tank, Paul. The shark tank! \n[142]What, that you're a scary guy? I get it. \n[143]Yeah, I get that way when a shark tries to chew on my ass. \n[144]I don't want to calm down. My girl friend saw me all wet? I told her I fell into a tank with the manatees. I lied to her last night, now this. I don't like it. \n[145]I'm glad you're entertained. What's the problem? \n[146]Okay.   What's going on? \n[147]I'm redefining 'weird' on an hourly basis. What were you thinking about when you started feeling anxious? \n[148]Which family? This one? \n[149]I want you to draw a picture of a house. In the sand. \n[150]A house. \n[151]I'll tell you after you do it. \n[152]Where are the people? \n[153]I know. But usually when people draw a house they draw people. Where are the people who live in your house? \n[154]Okay, forget the house. I'm going to say some words, and you say the first thing that comes into your mind. \n[155]Home -- \n[156]Mother -- \n[157]Father -- \n[158]Wife? \n[159]Son? \n[160]Son? \n[161]How do you know that? \n[162]Gracias. \n[163]Nice to meet you. \n[164]Nice family.    Cuban fishing boat captain? \n[165]About this? I think she'd be more worried about your career choice. \n[166]You know, normally a patient wouldn't smoke or drink during a session. \n[167]So tell me about your father. \n[168]He passed away? \n[169]How? \n[170]Were you and your father close? \n[171]Why was that? \n[172]You fought about it? \n[173]And then? \n[174]How did that feel? \n[175]Well, think about it. Were you angry, were you afraid? Sad? \n[176]Any feelings of guilt? \n[177]I'm just speculating, but maybe in some way you wanted him to die. \n[178]Well, you said you were fighting. You were rebelling against his authority. There may have been some unresolved Oedipal conflict. \n[179]Oedipus was a Greek king who killed his father and married his mother. \n[180]It's an   instinctual developmental drive.    The young boy wants to replace   his father so he can totally   possess his mother. \n[181]It's a primal fantasy -- \n[182]It's Freud. \n[183]Can't wait, Scott.    Can I call you 'Scott?' \n[184]Captain. \n[185]Yes, thanks for going to all this trouble, and I have to thank you and the Captain for something else. \n[186]For this. \n[187]Technically, it wasn't considered a marriage. It was like the Korean War -- more of a police action. \n[188]You're right.    Sorry. \n[189]Mr. Vitti! How are you? Mrs. Vitti! Honey, it's the Vittis! \n[190]Mr. and Mrs. Vitti, this is Laura, my fiancee. \n[191]And this is my son Michael. \n[192]Michael! \n[193]Mr. MacNamara -- uh -- \n[194]Mr. Vitti, this is Laura's father. \n[195]I've just got to talk to him for a sec. You okay? \n[196]Great. \n[197]I feel like I'm having one right now. How could you interrupt our party? \n[198]Just tell me the dream. \n[199]I don't know what it means.   What does it mean to you? \n[200]Then get Jelly. \n[201]Mr. MacNamara. \n[202]Nothing. Your father thinks I'm in the Mafia. \n[203]Let's get married. \n[204]That's it.   I've had it with you! \n[205]What happened? I just saw a man fall seven stories into a platter of poached salmon! That's what happened. \n[206]Yes. Everything! They're still picking the capers out of his forehead. \n[207]You're telling me it was suicide? \n[208]Oh, yeah, here it is. \n[209]slip of paper, pretends to read \n[210]Onto me? What are you talking about? Being an accessory to murder was not part of our understanding. \n[211]Laura! \n[212]Honey, why don't you wait downstairs? \n[213]I'll be right there. Everything's going to be all right. I promise. \n[214]Are you happy now?      You ruined my life! \n[215]Is that all you know? Do you hear yourself? I knew this would happen. \n[216]This whole thing has been one big disaster from the minute you walked into my office. We're finished! You hear me? I am no longer your doctor! \n[217]Of course because of this! You don't have even the tiniest shred of human decency. All you know is threats and violence and that's all you'll ever know and I can't be around that! \n[218]Closure. \n[219]A blocked wish -- \n[220]Yeah, right up until the shoving the balls. You can't keep doing this! You want to get physical? Take a walk. Get a punching bag. Hit a pillow. \n[221]Feel better now? \n[222]Call the Vatican. Ask them if anything's missing. \n[223]He felt bad. It's a wedding gift. \n[224]Hey, don't blame me. You didn't want to finish the ceremony. \n[225]I just want to marry you. \n[226]Come on. Next Saturday. It's all set. I even asked for a room with a low ceiling, just to discourage the jumpers. \n[227]Us three, a clergyman, and any family members who've completed their crisis counseling. \n[228]We'll do a neck check at the door. \n[229]Obsessive-compulsive disorder? \n[230]Michael, go to your room. \n[231]Go! \n[232]So.   FBI. \n[233]I'm a psychotherapist.    Paul Vitti is my patient. \n[234]Right.   Was.   That's what I meant. \n[235]Right. \n[236]That was a gift to celebrate the completion of his therapy. We got our television from an agoraphobic, so it's not that unusual -- you know, maybe you should discuss this with my attorney. \n[237]Well, yeah, but don't forget, the man is a sociopath. You've got to expect that kind of behavior -- \n[238]Excuse me, fellas. My folks are here and I'd like to -- well, die would be my first choice. Can I go out? \n[239]Honey, maybe the federal agents would like something to drink? Could you see what we have? \n[240]I tried, guys. \n[241]Hi!   What a surprise. \n[242]What can I tell you, Mom? It looked much smaller in the store. \n[243]I think it'll affect the tides. What are you doing here? \n[244]Yeah, but she and Michael are spending some time alone, you know, getting to know each other. That's important. I don't want to disturb that dynamic. \n[245]No. \n[246]Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to discuss that. \n[247]You, know, I always wanted to be great, but then I realized that I might have to settle for just being good enough. Now I've got this guy who's hurting and I'm thinking that if I can help this guy, maybe I can be a little bit great. \n[248]Didn't you read your own book? Instead of trying to run my life, why don't you just close your eyes, take a deep breath, tell me what you feel, tell me what you want. \n[249]You wrote it. \n[250]Is that really it? \n[251]You know why I became a shrink? Because I grew up with a great one walking around the house. \n[252]Yes, and because of you. \n[253]Okay, so you were saying? \n[254]No. If he said anything about a bloodbath, I probably would've remembered it. Bloodbath is one of those words that, you know, stands out in a conversation. \n[255]And if I don't? \n[256]You mean if I change my mind. \n[257]Laura -- \n[258]Laura, that was really -- \n[259]I'm going to buy some fruit. You want anything? \n[260]Listen, Paul, please don't send me any more gifts. \n[261]That's not the point.   It's a boundary issue. \n[262]Don't buy me a Rolex. \n[263]Listen, I really need to talk to you. \n[264]How did he die? \n[265]Do I need to know that? I'm having nightmares as it is. \n[266]Last night I dreamed we were walking down the street, I stopped to buy some fruit, and they shot me -- like Brando in The Godfather. \n[267]You dropped your gun, then you ran over to me and started yelling, 'Papa, Papa!' \n[268]Don't you see? You called me 'Papa.' It's all about your father. \n[269]Yes, but that's what your black milk dream was about, too. \n[270]Freud believed you're everyone in your dreams. \n[271]Let's say you are the baby. What kind of milk did you get from your father? \n[272]That's the whole point! We have to start talking about your father. You know what it's like dealing with you? This is you. You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a mess. I'm in pain. Okay, Paul, I can help you. Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti. \n[273]Let's not. \n[274]Yes, he's still alive. \n[275]That's not important. \n[276]What? \n[277]He's a psychiatrist. \n[278]We're running out of time, Paul. Let's not waste it talking about my problems. \n[279]No! \n[280]I'm not upset! \n[281]We have three days left. If you want to spend it screwing around, I can't help you. Call me when you're ready to get serious. \n[282]What do you want me to do? \n[283]You want me to sit in front? Paul usually sits in front. \n[284]Federal case? I'm not making a federal case? Let's go. \n[285]Wow, this is really good. Delicious. I love Italian food. I've never been to Italy but I'd love to go. I've been to France. And Jamaica. That's nice, but I'm sure it's very different from Italy. A whole different, uh -- So what's everybody doing this summer? \n[286]What? The first thing or the second thing? \n[287]Stevie Beef. Interesting name. When he was younger they probably called him Stevie Veal. You guys come here often? \n[288]Wait a second. Paul's father was murdered? \n[289]Paul, too?   He was there? \n[290]Bathroom. \n[291]I gotta -- you know -- poop. \n[292]Ahhhh! \n[293]I have to talk to you -- in private. \n[294]Why didn't you tell me about your father? \n[295]You said he died of a heart attack. \n[296]What's the problem?   Your father was murdered! \n[297]There's a big difference.   Why didn't you tell me? \n[298]That is not a little thing! \n[299]And you didn't think this was important enough to tell me? \n[300]You know what? I think you want to talk about it. \n[301]I think you do. \n[302]Then why did you choose this restaurant? \n[303]Of all the places we could've gone, why this one? \n[304]No, we're here because you wanted me to know about your father. You're reaching out to me. \n[305]I think we have some major trust issues here. \n[306]Jimmy, you can have shotgun this time. I don't mind. \n[307]My legs are short, it's fine in the back. \n[308]You know what? It's late. I think I'm just going to call it a night. Why don't I just grab a cab and head on home. \n[309]No really, it's all right. \n[310]You know, we call this a transference neurosis. It's when the patient starts acting out his problems with his therapist instead of out in the world. It's usually considered a good sign. Not for me, in this case, but -- \n[311]Don't kid yourself, Jelly. It doesn't get more personal than this. \n[312]Because you're a paranoid? No, actually you're a reverse paranoid. You think you're out to get everybody. \n[313]I betrayed you? What are you talking about? Who's got the gun? \n[314]They played me a tape! You said you were going to kill me. \n[315]It doesn't matter. I didn't betray you, Paul. Yes, they made me wear a wire, but I took it off, because I think I know how to help you now. \n[316]Yes, you do. \n[317]I think you do. \n[318]Okay. Can I ask you one last question? \n[319]What did you order? \n[320]What did you order? \n[321]That night. What were you eating the night your father got killed? \n[322]You don't remember? \n[323]What did your father have? \n[324]Try. \n[325]It's a simple question.    What was your father eating! \n[326]Good.    And you. \n[327]The food was on the table? \n[328]Did you see the guys coming? \n[329]Did your father see him? \n[330]Why? \n[331]He walked over to the table? \n[332]Did you say anything? \n[333]And you were mad at him. \n[334]And then. \n[335]And you blame yourself? \n[336]But you were mad at him. \n[337]You didn't kill him, Paul. You were angry but you didn't kill him. That's the life he chose. \n[338]Say it now, Paul. Talk to him. What do you want to tell him? \n[339]You have to.   Tell him, Paul. \n[340]It's okay, Paul. You can let go of it now. \n[341]You couldn't save him, Paul. He was trying to save you. That's what you fought about. He didn't want this for you, and you don't want it for Anthony. You don't want him to grow up the way you did -- without a father. \n[342]Your father's not dead, Paul. He's alive -- in you. And he's trying to tell you something. \n[343]Oh, my God! \n[344]Paul!   They're shooting! \n[345]Paul! For God's sake, shoot somebody! \n[346]Goddamn it! \n[347]Oh my God!    Did I do that? \n[348]I don't think I can see you anymore. \n[349]This was big tonight. You might feel a little raw for a while. \n[350]So good luck.    It's been -- \n[351]What kinds of things does he want you to say, Elaine? \n[352]Let me suggest something, Elaine. If the man wants you to say things ... damn it, you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if that's going to get the job done. Break out the wine, baby. Smoke a joint. Do what you have to do, because life is too short. It's just too fucking short. \n[353]No! \n[354]No, not you.    I was talking to him. \n[355]It's not important.     Yes. \n[356]Yes to the thing before. To her. That's a yes. Pick it up from there. \n[357]Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job. \n[358]Have you ever seen an episode like this? \n[359]Never mind. \n[360]Can't someone else in the family go for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie the Lip? What about you? You go? \n[361]Me?   You must be a moron. \n[362]You just said it yourself. \n[363]I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going. I'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. My wife is waiting -- \n[364]You can't shoot me, Jelly. \n[365]This is insane. \n[366]Then what? \n[367]I'm a psychologist.   Believe me, I can be vague. \n[368]I can't do this. I'm telling you, I cannot do this. \n[369]These are the bosses? That one looks like my Uncle Max. \n[370]I can't do this. \n[371]Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr. Vitti's health outside the family. You know better. \n[372]In answer to your first question, my name is Ben Sobol -- -- leone. Sobboleone. They call me -- 'The doctor.' As for your second question. I'm here representing Paul Vitti. As his conser -- conghili -- \n[373]Don't you ever correct me again! As his consigliere, I'm intimately involved in all aspects of the family business and I'm prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti on all matters. \n[374]Which thing are you talking about? The first thing or the second thing? \n[375]Well, I don't see how we can discuss the first thing without bringing up the second thing. Didn't you talk to the guy? \n[376]The guy with the thing. \n[377]How should I know? You brought it up. This is the whole problem. You can't have an intelligent conversation with the man. \n[378]It's not important what I think. What do you think? \n[379]I don't know.    Why would you? \n[380]Have you always had a problem dealing with your anger? \n[381]What do you think I'm talking about? \n[382]See, you're angry again. Do you feel you have to get angry to be heard? \n[383]Interesting. Do you feel you're not worthy enough to be talked about? \n[384]What do you think it means? \n[385]Could you pass the fruit, please? \n[386]What are you doing here? \n[387]Well done. \n[388]Good thinking. I was going to bring a machine gun but I don't have one. Of course, we haven't opened the wedding gifts yet. \n[389]Paul -- I tripped. \n[390]Paul, what would you say about what Donny's feeling? \n[391]And be patient, Donny. Most people's problems take months, sometimes years to resolve. \n[392]That should be plenty of time. \n[393]You know they found Primo Sindone dead in a field near LaGuardia. \n[394]Okay, just checking. \n[395]We don't say 'cured.' We say you had a 'corrective emotional experience.' \n[396]No.   You. You. \n[397]Happy? \n[398]What? \n[399]What do you say, Tony?   One more? ", "VITTI": "\n[1]I don't know. I don't like it. What do we need a meeting for? Let everybody worry about their own business. \n[2]What are we gonna get, a fuckin' web site? \n[3]Yeah, I remember. \n[4]Wait a second. I'm just gonna grab a toothpick. \n[5]So what did you find out? \n[6]What? \n[7]What? \n[8]Why the fuck would I want to kill Dominic? He was like a father to me. \n[9]Oh, is that what they figure? \n[10]I didn't kill him! I told you that! Don't you hear? \n[11]Nicky, you know me, right? \n[12]And you know what I'm gonna do to you if you lie to me, right? \n[13]I'm only gonna ask you this one time. Who killed Dominic Manetta? \n[14]Don't fuckin' lie to me! \n[15]You little rat bastard... \n[16]Forget about it. He doesn't know anything. \n[17]Get him outta here. \n[18]Yeah, thank God. All I know is if I didn't have some veal stuck in my teeth, I'd be laying there with Dominic. \n[19]If they did, we're heading for one big fuckin' war. Talk to Zello and Baldassare. Find out what you can. We got two weeks. If the other New York bosses are against us, I want to know it before I walk into that meeting. \n[20]I'm a little choked up here.   I gotta get some air. \n[21]I feel like shit. This whole thing is like a huge fuckin' headache. \n[22]Get the car. \n[23]How could it be fine? I've had like eight heart attacks in the last three weeks. \n[24]What? \n[25]Look at me. Do I look like a guy who panics? \n[26]Where did you go to medical school? I had a heart attack, you quack bastard. \n[27]pumping up the cuff with the squeeze-ball \n[28]If anyone asks you, you never saw me, and I was never here. Is that clear? \n[29]Good. Take the chart. \n[30]Jelly, I need you to do something for me as my friend. \n[31]You have to find me a doctor. \n[32]Not that kind of doctor.   I need a head doctor. \n[33]Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud. Do I have to spell everything out? \n[34]I need you to find me a psychiatrist. \n[35]Is he any good? \n[36]He had a card? That's a real fuckin' achievement. \n[37]It's not for me. It's for a friend. This friend is having some problems, so I'm going to ask the shrink some questions and get some answers for my friend. \n[38]And nobody can know. If anyone hears I'm talking to a shrink, it could be interpreted the wrong way. You know what I mean? \n[39]What? \n[40]You know who I am? \n[41]No you don't. \n[42]You've seen my picture in the papers? \n[43]Jelly, wait outside. \n[44]Sit down. \n[45]Tony Bennett, huh? \n[46]I was just gonna ask if you liked baseball. \n[47]I don't care about the car. \n[48]A friend of mine is having a problem and he might have to see a shrink, so I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Do we sit? \n[49]Okay, the first thing I gotta know about is privacy. You must hear a lot of weird shit in here. How do I know you won't go testifying -- not testifying -- but, you know, talking about it to somebody else. \n[50]Not fuckin' likely -- \n[51]So who starts? \n[52]I don't need therapy. I'm helping out my friend. You didn't hear me say that? \n[53]You guys are supposed to be so great when it comes to listening. You can't remember what I said two seconds ago. \n[54]I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not thrilled with the level of service up to this point. \n[55]He's a powerful guy. Never had a problem dealing with things, you know? Now all of a sudden, he's falling apart. He cries for no reason. He's having trouble sleeping. And then he started having these attacks. You know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest pains -- like you think you're gonna die. \n[56]What's with all you doctors and the fuckin' panic? Did I say panic? \n[57]Right. So the question is, what can he do to make it stop? \n[58]You -- you -- you -- you have a gift, my friend. Go on. \n[59]With you? \n[60]Where you going? \n[61]Where? \n[62]You know, this could be good. Just getting that off my chest, I feel better already. It's like a load is off my shoulders. Thank you. \n[63]You did something. The load? Off. Where is it? Don't know. You're good, Doctor. I'll be in touch. But listen to me. If I talk to you and it turns me into a fag, I'll kill you. You understand? \n[64]I go fag, you die. Got it? \n[65]What are you talking for?   I'm trying to do this here. \n[66]I got things on my mind.    Stop talking. \n[67]No, I wasn't thinking about my wife. Now I'm thinking about my wife. Goddamn it, Sheila, why can't you keep your mouth shut! \n[68]You no-good little two-bit piece of shit bastard! \n[69]I got news for you. I'm still fucked up. Whatever you did the other day, it didn't take. You did nothing for me. \n[70]I couldn't get it up tonight. \n[71]No, I mean for the big game against Michigan State. Of course sexually! \n[72]Doesn't that prove I'm motivated? \n[73]No, that's a cheat. You start with the pills, next thing you know you got implants with pumps. I think a hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not at all. \n[74]Are you gonna help me or not? \n[75]The dead dick thing? Never. Well, one time. Tonight. And another time. \n[76]Do the math. Two times. There was another time. But it was after a big meal, so, you know, that don't count. \n[77]Five. \n[78]Maybe not to you -- look at you -- but if I can't get it up, that makes me less of a man and I can't have that. \n[79]In my business I deal with animals. They may seem dumb to an educated guy like you, but make no mistake about it, Doctor, animals are very cunning. And they sense weakness. Right now I'm an injured animal. It's only a matter of time before one of the lions out there catches the scent. Then I'm dead. That's the way it is. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand the life I live and you don't understand me. \n[80]I have until the end of the week to get strong or they're gonna eat me up. If they don't kill me in the meantime. \n[81]I can't tell you and you don't want to know. \n[82]Look, the other day I saw a commercial on television, some kid playing with a couple of puppies. I cried for 45 minutes. Slap a pair of tits on me, I'm a woman! \n[83]You're turning me down? \n[84]You with your schmucky little office in your schmucky little house out there in Schmuckville -- you're turning me down? What, so you can spend more time listening to housewives piss and moan about how nobody fucks them right? \n[85]You see this? This is what I'm talking about! I'm a dead man! \n[86]You call yourself a doctor? You should be ashamed. A real doctor couldn't turn his back on a person who's suffering! \n[87]I wasn't with my wife. I was with my girlfriend. \n[88]What, you're gonna start moralizing with me now? \n[89]No. \n[90]I do things with her I can't do with my wife. \n[91]Hey. That's the mouth she kisses my children good night with. What's the matter with you? \n[92]You mean like seeing your best friend murdered? Yeah, I got stress. \n[93]It's just stress? \n[94]You.   You. You're very good. \n[95]No, you're right. You're right on the money. I can feel the juices rushing back to my manhood as we speak. \n[96]This settles it. You're my shrink. \n[97]Listen to you. The honesty. Nobody -- and I mean nobody -- talks to me like this. I'm ready. Let's do it. \n[98]I hear it all the time. Only it's more like, 'No, no, please, no!' \n[99]You want me to clear your schedule for you? \n[100]Thank you. \n[101]They were trying to make a point. \n[102]You're in a mood, you know that? \n[103]Okay.   Okay.   Calm down. \n[104]Manatees.   That's a funny word. Manatees. \n[105]Oh, I can tell you really care. \n[106]I had an episode. Not an actual panic attack, but I started panicking a little thinking I might have one. Does that seem weird to you? \n[107]I don't know. The usual bullshit. Family problems. \n[108]No, regular family. \n[109]What kind of house? A warehouse? A whorehouse? My house? What house? \n[110]Why? \n[111]This is good. I come to Florida and draw pictures in the sand like a jerkoff. \n[112]There.   You happy? \n[113]What people?   You told me to draw a house. \n[114]Well, you see, they'd come out and say hello, but the whole family's in the Witness Protection Program. It's very sad. What the fuck you want from me? \n[115]Good, more games. Shoot. \n[116]-- plate. \n[117]-- fucker. \n[118]-- forgive me for I have sinned. \n[119]Love. \n[120]See this? Again with the crying. Let's get out of here. We're being watched. Don't look. There's Feds on the roof of the hotel. \n[121]I'm a criminal. It's my job. \n[122]Look at this, the whole crew. You all right? Good flight? \n[123]That's okay. Marie, this is a friend of mine, Ben Sobol. He's -- from the boat. A fishing boat captain. Cuban refugee. \n[124]And this is Theresa and Anna -- \n[125]-- Anna, and the big guy, Anthony. \n[126]Jesus, Theresa, you are not wearing that suit to the pool. \n[127]I want you to wear one of those Arab bathrobes with a veil over your face, is what I want. \n[128]Okay, babe.    Hey, Anthony.   Guess what I got? \n[129]Marlins and the Braves -- right behind home plate, tonight. \n[130]Of course, you and me. Have fun at the pool. Stay out of the deep end. And don't swim for a couple hours after you eat. \n[131]Send Jimmy down with them. \n[132]I can't tell Marie you're a shrink. She'd worry, you know. \n[133]Just keep going with the therapy. \n[134]That's an interesting fact I'll have to remember if I'm ever on 'Jeopardy.' \n[135]My father. He was a big man in the neighborhood -- very well respected. Everybody loved him, God rest his soul. \n[136]No, I just like saying 'God rest his soul.' Yeah, he passed away. He died when I was about twelve. \n[137]Heart attack.    Sudden thing. \n[138]Close? Yeah, you know, pretty close. I guess we weren't getting along that great right then. \n[139]I was hangin'   out in the neighborhood.    I had a borghata -- like a kid   gang -- hooligan shit, nothin'   big. But my father didn't   like it. \n[140]He slapped the shit out of me. \n[141]And then that night he died. \n[142]It felt great! How did it feel? I don't know. \n[143]Yeah, I guess. \n[144]About what?   I didn't kill him. \n[145]Why would I want my father to die? \n[146]English. \n[147]Fuckin' Greeks. \n[148]Are you saying I wanted to fuck my mother? \n[149]Have you seen my mother? That is the sickest fucking thing I've ever heard. \n[150]Well, then Freud's a sick fuck, and you are too for bringing it up. \n[151]Senor Sobol! \n[152]Look at everybody. Everybody's smiling, everybody's happy. Nice. This is Marie, my girls, my boy, then all these guys. \n[153]Nice to meet you. \n[154]Whoa.  He's a bruiser. You're sure this is your kid? You're a pound and a half soaking wet. I've had lobsters bigger than you. You ever want a job, you come talk to me, right? \n[155]Excuse me. Is that polite? Is it? I'm trying to be nice here. Do I walk up to you and go, 'You're whoever you are. The prick'? \n[156]Yeah? Okay, well, sorry. But you should know, there is no mob, and, P.S., I personally have never been convicted of a crime. We're nine for nine, right? \n[157]I heard about the wedding. Here you go. A little something for the bride and groom. God bless. You should live and be well. \n[158]Yeah, you can. Now, if you don't mind, I just need to borrow this guy for a couple of minutes, then that's it. I'm out of here. Okay? \n[159]Of course. I wouldn't do anything to screw up your wedding. I gotta talk to you. Come on. Have a great night, everybody. Nice to meet you. \n[160]Watch that door. And don't listen to what we say. \n[161]Okay, listen. I had a really weird dream last night. \n[162]You know, you're very rigid about certain things. \n[163]Okay. I'm asleep. I hear a baby crying. I go to the refrigerator, I get a bottle of milk, I take it to the baby, but when I go to give it to him, I see that the milk is black. \n[164]Okay, get out of here! \n[165]What's it mean? And I don't want to hear any more filth about my mother. \n[166]This is what I'm paying you for? I say something, you say it right back to me? I could get Jelly to do this for nothing. \n[167]Why don't you look over that way before I have to bust your fuckin' head open? \n[168]Tell Mikey to take Marie and the kids right to the airport. You get the car, bring it around to the back and wait for me. \n[169]What happened? \n[170]Did he break anything? \n[171]Hey, people get depressed, they jump. It's a human tragedy, but it's not my fault. \n[172]I think he left a note. Jelly, did they find that note? \n[173]Enough talking. We got to get out of here. The place is crawling with feds. I'm going back to New York and I suggest you do the same. They're probably onto you too now. \n[174]Hey, why you busting my balls? I didn't kill him. I can't speak for everyone in the room, but -- The son-of-a-bitch came after me! It was self-defense. Trust me, Doc. In this one, we're the good guys. \n[175]Great.  Another country heard from. Get her outta here. \n[176]That's a beautiful dress. \n[177]You're upset. \n[178]What, you think I wanted this? I'm the victim here! I swear, I'm going to kill that son-of-a-bitch! \n[179]Just 'cause of this? \n[180]What do you want me to do? \n[181]Primo, it's Paul Vitti. \n[182]Not good. Whoever killed Dominic is shooting at me now and I'm having a lot of feelings about it and I'd like to get some kinda -- \n[183]-- closure on this. \n[184]I feel very angry, you know. Very, uh, enraged. Mad. Real mad. \n[185]Why am I telling you? Like you had nothing to do with it? \n[186]Okay, whatever, I just wanted to tell you how I feel because I know that anger is -- \n[187]-- a blocked wish, and I'm getting my wish unblocked and I'm looking forward to getting some closure -- \n[188]-- and if you make one more move on me I swear to God I'll cut your fuckin' balls off and shove 'em up your ass! \n[189]Good? \n[190]There's your fucking pillow. \n[191]Yeah, I do. \n[192]What's the point here? \n[193]It's none of anybody's business what I say in there. \n[194]So what do you want me to do? \n[195]What do you mean, end it? \n[196]You want me to whack my doctor? \n[197]No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear? \n[198]No, go ahead. \n[199]Papa!   Papa! \n[200]You look lousy. You all right. \n[201]You didn't like the fountain? \n[202]Boundary issue? I say if more people gave from the heart, we'd all be better off. Let's see your watch. Piece of junk. You're getting a Rolex. \n[203]Who said anything about buying it? \n[204]Tommy Angels. We grew up together. Worked for a crew out of Jersey City. \n[205]He was on his way to talk to a federal prosecutor. Got hit by a truck -- twice. \n[206]Good scene.    Was I there? \n[207]I was Fredo.    I don't think so. \n[208]You're losing it, Doc.   You may need therapy yourself. \n[209]Him I don't know. Let's get private. \n[210]What're you, nuts? It was your dream. \n[211]Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my dream, I'm bringing the baby the black milk. \n[212]Yeah, well, that guy I don't need to hear about. I can't even call my mother on the phone after that thing you told me. \n[213]Could we stop talking about my father? \n[214]Very good. Now I'll do you. 'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said this would be easy. Let's see how you like it. Let's talk about your father. \n[215]Is he still alive? \n[216]What kind of work does he do? \n[217]You paused. \n[218]You paused. That means you had a feeling. What does he do? \n[219]Ooh, you're fucked up.   Next patient, please. \n[220]Your father's a problem? \n[221]That's what you just said!   You seem upset. \n[222]Hey, I'm good at this. \n[223]Say hello to your father for me! \n[224]You want me to whack my doctor? \n[225]No. Nobody touches him. You hear me? Anybody lays a finger on him, I'll kill 'em. Is that clear? \n[226]You want me to whack my doctor? \n[227]I'll kill 'em. \n[228]I know this guy. He would never talk to the Feds. \n[229]Come on.   You don't know this guy. \n[230]This is Ben. He's a friend of mine. Say hello to Carlo Mangano. \n[231]Carlo was on my father's crew. He's always been like a -- I don't know -- like a cousin to me. \n[232]I know, that's what I'm saying. It's like a family thing. The closeness. \n[233]I know. So did you take care of that thing I asked you about? \n[234]It's okay. \n[235]How about that other thing? \n[236]Did the guy give you a problem? \n[237]What did he say? \n[238]Did you tell him you weren't going for it? \n[239]You always gotta nip that shit in the bud. \n[240]Including the second thing. \n[241]Exactly. Don't repeat any of that to anyone. \n[242]That's Stevie Beef over there. I gotta go say hello to him for a second. Come on. \n[243]Leave us alone. \n[244]What about him? \n[245]So what's the problem? \n[246]Heart attack, murdered, what's the difference? He's dead. \n[247]Because it's private. You think I tell you every little thing? \n[248]Okay, you want to know? Analyze this. I was twelve years old, the whole family was having dinner together right over there, two guys walked in and shot him dead right in front of us. Okay? \n[249]What am I supposed to do? Spend the rest of my life crying about the past? Forget about it. \n[250]No, I don't want to talk about it. \n[251]No, I don't. \n[252]'Cause I like it, okay? \n[253]White clam sauce. The best. \n[254]I'll reach out to you -- \n[255]Do what he says. \n[256]Leave us alone. \n[257]You know why I have to do this, don't you? \n[258]Don't bullshit me! You betrayed me! You stabbed me in the back. \n[259]You think I'm an idiot? Don't insult my intelligence. You cooperated! You talked to the Feds! \n[260]Never.   I never said that. \n[261]I don't want to know what you think. \n[262]No, I don't! \n[263]It's over! Don't you get it? I took one chance and that's it. \n[264]What? \n[265]What? \n[266]When? \n[267]How the hell do I know? \n[268]It was 35 years ago. \n[269]I told you!   I don't remember. \n[270]What's the matter with you? \n[271]Penne. \n[272]Ravioli. \n[273]They were just serving it. \n[274]One of them.   Dressed like a busboy. \n[275]No, but I knew he looked wrong. \n[276]His pants. They looked too good for a busboy. \n[277]I watched him the whole way. \n[278]My father was so mad at me. \n[279]I couldn't say anything. \n[280]I never saw the second guy.    My mother started screaming. \n[281]I coulda saved him. \n[282]I killed my father. \n[283]I never got to say good-bye. \n[284]I can't. \n[285]I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \n[286]Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it? You can give me back the gun now, Doctor. \n[287]It's okay. I wasn't really gonna whack you. All right, maybe I was gonna whack you, but I was real conflicted about it. Progress, right? \n[288]Yeah, I figured. \n[289]Yeah. \n[290]No, I'm great. Never felt better in my life. When this meeting is over they won't know what hit 'em. \n[291]Shouldn't you be outside playing or something? \n[292]How long you gonna sit there? \n[293]I'm done. \n[294]Primo! \n[295]Wait outside with the car running. \n[296]Saving your ass. Sit down.    I'll take it from here. \n[297]I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was late. Those of you who know me will know I meant no disrespect. If it's all right with you, there's something I'd like to say, then I'll leave you to your business. \n[298]About two and a half weeks ago, somebody killed my friend, Dominic Manetta. \n[299]What I really came here to say is that I've come to a very important decision in my life. I want out. \n[300]I'm going away for a while, but I will respect the oath I took the day I was made, and whatever I know about anyone else's business, I take with me to the grave. You have my word. \n[301]As for my own organization, I know Carlo Mangano would like to be the new boss. \n[302]That's why he betrayed Dominic and me to our enemies and sent his own man to kill me in Miami. \n[303]But I leave it to my people to deal with that and choose their own boss. And even though it's my right, I won't take revenge, mostly because I'm in a good place mentally and feeling good about me. \n[304]I realize that, so as an extra token of good faith between us, I've taken the liberty of writing down everything I know and putting it in a safe deposit box in case anything happens to me or my family. \n[305]Let's move. \n[306]I don't want to do this, Primo. \n[307]Not anymore. Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were? \n[308]I don't think so. Mo-Mo! \n[309]Bigs! \n[310]Eddie! \n[311]It's over, Primo. Now get the fuck outta here. \n[312]I can't believe it. You took a bullet for me. What doctor ever did that much for a patient? I'll never forget that. \n[313]Yeah. You tripped over your unconscious. \n[314]And how does that make you feel? \n[315]I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't you? \n[316]Donny, when you're thirsty, you don't go to the wall -- you go to the well. You know what I'm saying? Your mother may never be able to listen to you, but you have friends here who will. Okay? \n[317]I heard. I had nothing to do with it. There were guys lined up from Canarsie to Atlantic City who wanted to whack that bastard. \n[318]You know, Doc, I don't think I ever thanked you properly for curing me. \n[319]You, you, you're very good. ", "JELLY": "\n[1]The word is Primo Sindone must have ordered it, but, uh -- \n[2]A lot of people think you set him up. \n[3]So you could be the big boss. Everybody figures you're lookin' to wipe out the competition before the big meeting. \n[4]It's alright with me if you did -- \n[5]That's all right, sir. It's our fault for being in front of you like that. \n[6]It's okay.   Forget about it. \n[7]No, it was like that before. \n[8]Why?    Fuck the police. \n[9]You're a doctor? \n[10]A shrink. You talk to a lotta nuts, huh? \n[11]Pings and knocks. Cheap gas. Hey, how do those minivans handle? \n[12]Take it easy, Doc. \n[13]You feel all right? \n[14]You havin' one of those mindgrains? \n[15]Anything. \n[16]We just came from the doctor. \n[17]You're gonna change your face like Sonny Black? Don't get his nose though, he looks like a pig. \n[18]It saves time. \n[19]Wow. This is like the Psychic Network or something. I just ran into a psychiatrist. Actually he ran into me. \n[20]Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy. He had a business card and everything -- \n[21]What do you need a shrink for anyway? \n[22]Got it. \n[23]Of course. Absolutely. Can I ask you one thing? \n[24]This friend.    Is it me? \n[25]Dr. Sobol? \n[26]Yeah, I know, I'm sorry. \n[27]Bingo. Get outta here. \n[28]Upsa-daisy.   You got a coat, nutbar? \n[29]He's leaving. \n[30]I'll give you a hundred bucks to get out of here. \n[31]A hundred and fifty. \n[32]You're not that fuckin' crazy. \n[33]Dr. Sobol. Dr. Sobol. \n[34]Mr. Vitti wants to see you.   I have your robe. \n[35]No, I think they use the men's room next door at the Burger King. Mr. Vitti wants to see you. \n[36]You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's. That means you're on call twenty- four hours a day just like the rest of us. \n[37]Don't be a skavootz. It is what it is. If he needs you sooner, you go. \n[38]Already done. \n[39]That's right. \n[40]My ears are sealed. \n[41]That's fuckin' weird. \n[42]Sorry. \n[43]I'm gonna get something to eat. You want like a sandwich or somethin'? \n[44]A half a sandwich. \n[45]I'll be back in about twenty minutes. \n[46]No, but they will in a minute. \n[47]It's Dr. Sobol. He says he needs to see you right away. \n[48]Sit up front with Jimmy. \n[49]Paretti's has a very special meaning to Paul. \n[50]Hey! \n[51]Hey, just shut up. \n[52]He don't like to talk about it. \n[53]I'll go with you. \n[54]at the urinal, reacts to Ben's cry. \n[55]You need more roughage. A bran muffin in the morning would help with that. \n[56]Sorry, Doc.    It's not personal, you know. \n[57]What's wrong with you? Don't you have any respect? This is a very difficult thing for Paul. \n[58]Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart. \n[59]He FIRES back at Handsome Jack. \n[60]He reloads and FIRES again. \n[61]He sees Handsome Jack emerge from cover and takes him out with FIVE QUICK SHOTS. \n[62]No, Doc. That one's mine. You got the Chevy Camaro and the side-by-side refrigerator-freezer. \n[63]How you feelin', boss?   You need anything? \n[64]Doc, we're going to need to hurry it up here. Hi, kid. \n[65]Haul ass, buddy. We got a problem. \n[66]Ooh, she's feisty. Watch out, Doc. Tick tock, let's go. Hurry up and pronounce them, huh? \n[67]Okay.   Kiss, kiss -- \n[68]I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Sobol, but duty calls, you know? \n[69]Nice, huh? \n[70]You're a pistol. I like her. \n[71]He's bad, Doc. Worse than I ever seen him. I think his inner child is all fucked up. \n[72]Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss Cartwright got bit by a raccoon. He got this fever and he was shaking -- \n[73]This is serious, Doc. If he doesn't make this meeting, they'll kill him for sure. \n[74]That would work except for one little detail. I'm a fucking moron. I'm known for it. You have to go. \n[75]Hey!   Watch that. \n[76]It's different when I say it. When you say it, it sounds very negative. \n[77]Doc. \n[78]Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't shoot you. But here's something about me you should know. I never got married, Doctor Sobol. I don't have a hobby. I never got a dog or a cat. I don't even have a goldfish. I live for one reason only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and he's what I'm thinking about when I close my eyes to sleep. If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would I do it, I would hope to survive so I could do it again and again until he told me to stop. This is all I know. This is all I got. So please don't think I won't kill you, because I'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one. You're going to that meeting. \n[79]Shut up. You're making him nervous. If he gets nervous and fucks up, they'll kill him for sure. Let's go over it again. \n[80]Mr. Vitti's been detained, apologies all around, blah, blah, blah. Then you say you're the new consigliere, and you're prepared to speak for Mr. Vitti. \n[81]Then you just keep your mouth shut, and hope nobody asks you nothin'. \n[82]Shut up. If you have to talk, just be vague. Can you do that? \n[83]Don't fucking whine! Whining's a dead giveaway. Come on! You're the consigliere, for Chrissake. \n[84]On his way.   Don't worry. \n[85]He's -- it's okay. Forget about it. \n[86]Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti has been detained and he sends his apologies for -- being detained -- and he apologizes for his -- detainment. \n[87]Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect. The thing is, he's not feeling well. He's sick and he -- didn't feel well -- \n[88]Consigliere -- ", "LAURA": "\n[1]So judging from the mob scene around the pool here today, I think you'd have to say that there's nothing 'off' about the 'off-season' in Miami Beach this summer. Now, on a personal note, this is my last report for W.V.B.F. I'm getting married to a wonderful man and moving to New York, so if you're up that way, watch for me on the W.P.I.X. news team. Thanks for everything, Miami. For the last time, this is Laura MacNamara, W.V.B.F. news. \n[2]Catch! \n[3]I'll do the re-asks, then you guys can just shoot the inserts and pack it up. Ben! \n[4]This is him, everyone!    This is the guy! \n[5]Oh, I missed you. \n[6]This is Michael? I don't think so. If I remember correctly, Michael was a little boy, and this, this is a great big kid. Hey, you. Tell us what you did with Michael Sobol. \n[7]Okay. Come on. Give me a break. I'm trying. \n[8]Sorry. Just smack me if I do that again. How are you, Michael? \n[9]Go ahead. If you break something, don't worry. I'm out of here. \n[10]You think he likes me? \n[11]You are? And you still really want to get married? \n[12]But what if you get tired of me? I know so many couples that were really happy, then they got married and just completely lost interest in each other. \n[13]I just don't want to lose the passion. \n[14]I want us to be like animals. You know just screaming and sweating and tearing at each other all the time -- \n[15]Oh my God. \n[16]What is wrong with you? I woke up, you were gone, no note or anything. I've been going out of my mind, Ben. I walked all over the hotel looking for you. I almost called the police! \n[17]You have patients in Florida? \n[18]Who is this patient? \n[19]Oh, Ben. \n[20]You're not going to treat him. \n[21]Tell me you're not. \n[22]That would be too scary. You don't want a person like that in your life, believe me. I've covered the mob down here. I've seen what they can do. \n[23]You sure? \n[24]I was so worried. \n[25]Come on. Get into it. \n[26]Just stop. We're having fun, right? \n[27]Would you like a drink, because I'm definitely having eight or nine. \n[28]Thank you very much. \n[29]Mr. Vitti, we can't accept this. \n[30]Okay. Then you leave us alone, right? \n[31]I've never been less okay. \n[32]What was that about? \n[33]Oh. \n[34]How could you do that? \n[35]Why, they're going to throw me off the balcony, too? I am thirty -- over thirty years old and all my life I have dreamed of walking down the aisle in a beautiful white dress and marrying the man I love. \n[36]Thank you, but it's not about the dress! We were supposed to get married! \n[37]Of course I'm upset! I'm going downstairs to pack, then I'm going to New York and I'm getting married with you or without you. Okay? \n[38]Well, we're not married, so I guess we'll have to send it back. \n[39]What did you expect? You think that's what I want to remember on our anniversary? 'Gee, honey, let's go look at the wedding video. There's my parents, there's your parents, and there's the guy who plunged to his death.' \n[40]I'm starting to think that's not going to happen. \n[41]And who's going to be there? \n[42]And no guests without necks. Everybody has to have a neck. \n[43]Was your patient. \n[44]But not like a real patient. \n[45]Yeah, maybe you should. \n[46]Too bad you didn't remember that when you were breaking in. \n[47]No. \n[48]A bloodbath? \n[49]Okay. Guess what, fellas? You don't scare me. \n[50]Sit down! There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us?

All I see is his man Jelly and some sawed-off little prick nobody knows. \n[18]Detained? What kind of bullshit is that? What's more important than this?
