Tector looks at him silently. 148 PIKE TURNS TO MOUNT THE HORSE. Placing his foot in the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on. The leather breaks and. he falls under the animal. Landing on his back, he lets out a loud shriek.     39. 1.9 THE OTHER N'EN LOOK DOWN AT HIM AS TEEM MOUNT. Dutch, help. 150 PIKE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET. None of them move forward to help him and he doesn't expect them to. He is visibly miserable as he recovers the reins of his animal and tears off the.broken leather. 151 LYLE AND TECTOR GRIN A LITTLE. Sykes turns away. \n[50]Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas. He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following. \n[51]We started together -- we'll end it together. \n[52]Your boy2 \n[53]He did fine --  Why didn't you tell me he was your grandson? \n[54]No ---he did fine...just fine. \n[55]So --? \n[56]How? \n[57]Ashamed of having us meet your people? \n[58]Far as Ifm concerned, you can go, \n[59]Looks like I'm outvoted. \n[60]Wants to visit his folks alone -- thinks we're a little rank for his people. \n[61]How do' you want it? \n[62]Hard to believe. \n[63]You know us, then -- \n[64]Like to ride with us, old man? And for a moment, the old man's eyes flash as he watches: 162- DUTCH AND THREEVILLAGERS SHOEING a very small, very mean 16L. mule. All four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling.. \n[65]The Federal. troops they don? t. protect you -- \n[66]-So Angel lives with a dream -- while Mapache eats the mango -- \n[67]Many times -- and with the mango too. \n[68]I never could carry a candle to you, old timer. \n[69]I dream when I sleep -- and eat when I'm hungry. \n[70]It doesn't make any difference, kid our business is in Agua Verde For a moment Angel looks like he will explode, then he lifts a bottle of tequi.lla in salute to Pike. \n[71]We'll go. have a drink, then try and sell the horses. \n[72]I seen one just like this in Waco... \n[73]No...alcohol:...or gasoline. 190 FREDDY SYKES EDGES UP CLOSE TO PIKE. He is anxious to make a. statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car. \n[74]No,. the old man's right. They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour...goin' to use them in the war, they say. (as T(ector looks at him astonished This could cover. 30 miles in an hour -- ' cording to the road, of course. \n[75]Not that easy -- these automobiles can't stand.any rough ground -- or hot sun like a horse ---they're for show mostly. 191 TECTOR TOUCHES A FENDER AND ONE of the guards spurs toward him, cursing in Spanish. Tector backs off,. hands in the air. \n[76]You're here with us,pardner -- any business you got with the general comes after we finish ours -- and that is selling horses.. \n[77]You make.one move to trouble and I'll -kill you -- understand -- we stick together. \n[78]Let's get some beer and talk to the general about his automobile and our extra horses,,.nice and easy.

He places a hand on Angel's shoulder. \n[84]His sweetheart -- \n[85]He didn't, he was. after the girl... Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z'amorra with a puzzled expression. \n[86]He went a little crazy when he saw her with you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina. \n[87]I. never heard of any American troops fighting down here... \n[88]We have vez\"y'few sentiments in common with our government. \n[89]Of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is the easiest to hit -- But I've got to figure where we can get out with. the wagon.     \n[90]Arms shipments are generally. kept secret ...how did you find out about this one? \n[91]I -- we can do 'it , , , But we're going to need special equipment. \n[92]With your permission ...I need a bath. \n[93]We better get him cleaned up...     \n[94]Por favor, General -- but I need him. \n[95]I choose my own... withyour permission. Zamorra joins Mapache, looks at Pike whose hand is close to his. gun, turns to the General. \n[96]Some day I'm going to build me one of these and live in it.  I don't know why I \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 didn' t just let him kill you. \n[97]Take them a large bag of gold when it's over. \n[98]Move them a thousand miles away and buy them a ranch --. two -- three, ranches. \n[99]Son -- twenty thousand cuts a lot of. family ties. \n[100]Twenty. \n[101]i. know. you will... Then. they all turn as: 233 TECTOR AND.LYLE AND THEIR LADIES enter, somewhat wet and stained with wine. \n[102]Pleasure-, Ma' ain. \n[103]I met a woman I wanted to marry... \n[104]Buenas no the s mi amor. Aurora swings and catches him full handed across the face9 the groceries scatter on the floor -- Pike bounces off the wall,. looks at her, tries to grin. \n[105]Your husband due back? \n[106]No! He picks up a pan with a hot handle, drops it, spilling hot stew or soup on his foot, hops around cursing looking at the shambles on the stove and on the floor.' 236DD AURORA STANDS LOOKING AT HIM WITH LOVE, then smiling softly crosses to the side-board and pours him a drink. He takes it, suddenly both are laughing. \n[107]She had a husband and I should have had enough sense to kill him. He wasn't around and I got careless. One night he.walked in on us - - got her with the first shot. He caught me here with the second then the damndd coward turned and ran. \n[108]Not yet but there-hasn't been.a day or an hour that I haven't thought about getting him - - he didn't want that woman he just. wanted to kill somebody - - well, he killed \n[109]This is the last go round - - this time we do it right. \n[110]Get the guns off and get on, out of here; He turns and scrambles down inside the cab. Outside the men quickly finish loading and the wagon pulls up alongside the cab. \n[111]Not yet - I want to return e. favor.. He.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2yanks the throttle into reverse and jumps off the locomotive onto the wagon. \n[112]Get on those rear. wheels'. The Gorch brothers scramble down into knee-deep water and begin to push. \n[113]Lyle; .Put your horse in the traces! 336 LYLE HANDS A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY TO TECTOR and nudges his horse forward.-As he swings off, it is obviaeas that he is a little drunk, \n[114]And we got a hell of a long way to go 'with a considerable number of people just waiting to take 'em away. \n[115]Agua Verde -- or before -- and when he \n[116]Last I saw he was ridin' four sticks of dynamite into the river. \n[117]Yeah he'll be along.     85. 338 HE CROSSES SLOWLY TO HIS HORSE, his weariness showing, puts his foot in the stirrup, hesitates. \n[118]Let's move.- And they do, still chuckling-as we.; \n[119]Are they bluffing. or did they really miss it? \n[120]A lot depends on how hungry they are...  You- stay up there and look for bighats.,..I'm going to start. ..'rigging the fireworks. Dutch: turns, crawls back and lifts the glassese Pikewalk down near the wagon and. prods. Angel., who.is sleeping _: his boot. \n[121]1. need some-help. 353 ANGEL QUICKLY GETS TO HIS FEET and follows Pike. to the wagon. Pike reaches into a box near the seat and removes a piece of fuse. \n[122]Get that case of explosives near the back. Angel climbs on the wagon. Lyle, hearing him,.crawls out from underneath. His brother also awakens and starts moving around. Sykes, hat. over his eyes, looks up but doesn't move.. \n[123]Protection. (as they look at \n[124]Now I'm goin' to make it real easy for something to happen. 35L PIKE SETS THE BOX ON THE GROUND and pries open the lid. He begins setting the sticks on the ground next to the box. Angel gets down and Pike hands.him a coil. of baling wire. \n[125]Wrap these in pairs and put a fuse cap between them. Angel takes the first two and starts to work on them. 355 LYLE WATCHES FOR A MOMENT THEN NUDGES HIS BROTHER and climbs 356 ANGEL AND PIKE ARM THE DYNAMITE STICKS in the shade of the wagon.. \n[126]You told them about our trail? \n[127].Whatever I don't know, I'm going to learn. \n[128]Hold up 1.. \n[129]Just hope. they don't belong to Villa. \n[130]Tell that one in front to come. over here ...Alone! \n[131]Tell him to-come closer! \n[132]You see this? He tickles. the end of the fuse-with the dead ash on his cigar. \n[133]Itts-a: very fast fus.e..,any trouble and no guns for the general. Herrera is solemn as he ponders for a moment, then begins to 'smile. \n[134]Nobody:..nunca nadiel \n[135]Now, \n[136]Go on back-and tell the General that one of us will. be there tomorrow for-the trade..1,any trouble -- no gunsb Herrera takes one last look at the guns. then he wheels his horse and. rides off.     \n[137]This isn\u00c2\u00b0t over yeti 376 HERRERA RIDES HIS HORSE TO THE BEND IN. THE RIVER then, reaching his men,\u00e2\u0080\u00a2reins his horse up and-turns him around. He whistles loudly and calls out : \n[138]Ride ahead a hundred yards and check the washes...  You and I will cover the flanks --  Keep on the gun -- watch the rim. \n[139]I'll tell you when -- \n[140]Where? Angel smiles, then turns and calls softly. \n[141]Cut him loose 388 ANGEL SPEAKS, LED BY IGNACIO, THEY QUICKLY FREE TECTOR and hand him his weapons with murmured apologies. Tector looks at them, whistles, softly. \n[142]Don't break that fuse... Angel lifts a crate. \n[143]They part of your village? \n[144]How long have they been around? \n[145]How long have they been following us... close? 391 ANGEL EASES THE RIFLE CRATE DOWN, TWO PEONS TAKE IT. He turns to Ignacio. \n[146]If they ever get armed and led, this whole country'll go up in smoke. \n[147]Don't worry we got ' em...hidden. As soon as I. get 'my share of the gold I'll tell you where four cases are... $2500 worth..  The others are waiting at the wagon and unless I r eturn pretty damn quick they. blow it. 'Zamorra smiles, admiring Pike's caution. \n[148]Quicker I get back, the quicker the next load'll get here. 399 HERRERA BRINGS A SMALL WOODEN STRONG BOX. Kneeling on the ground he opens it and counts out two small bags of gold, and hands them to Zamorra. Zamorra hands them to Pike. \n[149]About two.. miles up the arroyo ... three cases of rifles, one of ammunition, are in the brush behind it. \n[150]Our contract was 16 cases of rifles and 8 of ammunition -- for $10,000 -- not a machine gun. \n[151]I'll think it over. \n[152]Just carryin' all this weight. He hold's up two bags of gold. \n[153]You and your brother take in the next' load, and the machine gun - 'then Dutch and Angel.

No, I'm tired of being hunted -- we go back to Agua Verde and let the General take,.. care of those boys. \n[159]He's so tickled with the guns he'll be celebrating for a week and happy to do us a favor. Thornton ain't going after us in there. While they're busy pick- ing over Freddy) we'll.' take the back trail off this mountain and head for town. The others look at him silently. Finally: \n[160]We take one sack to pay our way. \n[161]I hate to see an animal treated like that. \n[162]Maybe we- could buy him. They are silent for a long moment. Finally: \n[163]We,could use another gun. 450 MAPACHE, ZAMORRA AND THE GERMAN ADVISORS NOW GROUPED around the fire see the men. \n[164]I want to buy him back... Dutch and the others look at him surprised, \n[165]I,'11 pay you his share of the gold. \n[166]I'll give half my share to get him back. \n[167]You've had your fun with him... \n[168]Want to go hunting, General? Mapache looks at him confused. \n[169]Why not?. The group moves through the celebration out the main gate and into the village beyond. \n[170]Let's get Angel... 462 TECTOR\u00e2\u0080\u00a2IMMEDIATELY REACHES.FOR HIS GUN and stands as if he has just been given an important order by a commanding offi- cer. Lyle rises more slowly, begins to check the.-loads in his pistols. \n[171]Yeah. 464 THEY CROSS TO THEIR HORSES, THEIR DRUNKENNESS LESSENING with every step. Pike and Dutch pull rifles. or shotguns from their saddle scab- bards as do . Lyle.and-Tector,. then they move up the village street.. \n[172]We want Angel; Mapache stares at them without answering.

They are silent -- finally: \n[17]Back off to what?  Any real ideas for a next one? Pike closes his eyes and leans back. \n[18]That kind of information is kind of. rough to come by. \n[19]You must have hurt that railroad pretty bad -- they spent a lot of time and money getting that ambush set up for us. \n[20]Pride, I guess \n[21]And you -- and me --did we learn -- being wrong today? \n[22]Where'd you find him? \n[23]Pike, I wouldn?t have it no other -way aither. \n[24]We're not going to find much down here., That damned Huerta' s scraped it clean. \n[25]If you know a shorter way..': show us. Angel looks away and is silent for several seconds. \n[26]That sounds right to me.. \n[27]And take what? Tector thinks this over, doesn't answer. \n[28]All soldiers - not a bounty hunter in sight. \n[29]That could run a horse right into the ground. \n[30]Angel -- who does this thing belong to? \n[31]The official carrazo of the Pache Generalisimo.

The mariachis are gather- ing around Mapache.. Lyle shifts in his chair to look at them. 198 MAPACHE IS LAUGHING AND DRINKING. The German. leans close to Zamorra and speaks in Spanish. \n[33]I'm down to about twenty in silver... \n[34]Generalisimo hell -- he's just a damn bandit grabbing all he can for himself. \n[35]No sir -- we don't.hang nobody or torture them -- I hope the people here kick him and the rest of the scum like him right into-their graves.     56.. \n[36]Que pasa:: \n[37]Era su novia; The Mexicans immediately respond to Dutch's explanation.

He drinks, passes the bottle to Dutch.. \n[52]You didn't catch up with him? \n[53]They're coming; 269 GORCH ON FRONT OF THE. LOCOMOTIVE WHIRLS AROUND and looks back for an instant as Dutch yells.
