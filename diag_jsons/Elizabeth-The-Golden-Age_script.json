{"dialogues": {"ELIZABETH": "\n[1]Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out by her own ungrateful nation. \n[2]Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is our guest. And she is under our control. \n[3]While she lives? \n[4]You'd have me make a martyr of her. What is her crime? \n[5]How many Catholics are there in England, sir? \n[6]What would you have me do? `Cut out' half the people of England? \n[7]If any of my people break the law, they will be punished. Until that day, I wish them to be let them alone. \n[8]Fear creates fear, sir. I will not punish my people for their beliefs. Only for their deeds. England love their Queen. My constant endeavour is to earn that love. \n[9]What people? \n[10]\n[11]\n[12]It's not her fault that she's next in line to the throne. Don't hide your face. \n[13]Isn't it customary to obtain a husband before producing an heir? We shall have to look out a husband for you soon, Bess. \n[14]Don't you want to be married? \n[15]Why stop there? Turkey has a Sultan. China has an Emperor. What sort of man do you want? \n[16]That's where you and I differ, Walsingham. I find the impossible far more interesting. And good legs. You'll want good legs. \n[17]So that you can kiss him without choking. There must be any amount of princes in undiscovered lands across the sea. Find me an honest one of those. \n[18]And they know very well that if I fall, they all come tumbling down after me. \n[19]Let's pray, Bess. May we have wisdom not to fear shadows in the night, and courage when the day of danger truly dawns. \n[20]Lines round my mouth. Where did they come from? \n[21]Smile lines? When do I smile? \n[22]Now you have smile lines too. \n[23]A puddle... \n[24]A puddle... \n[25]You have the plans for the new docks? \n[26]Let me think on it. What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed? \n[27]What again? \n[28]Still mad, you mean. (Looking around). Where's Bess? \n[29]Late again, Bess. \n[30]Given. Once. \n[31]My suitors. \n[32]More your age than mine, Bess. How old is he? \n[33]I become almost enthusiastic. Send for him. Where is he, then? \n[34]How much longer do you think I can play this game? \n[35]Indeed? \n[36]Well, sir. Who are you? \n[37]Ah, yes. Raleigh. I've heard of your voyage. What's your rank? \n[38]What do you want? \n[39]Yes, well, here you are. \n[40]Virginia? And if I marry? Will you change the name to Conjugia? \n[41]Who are they? \n[42]Have they no ruler of their own? \n[43]These gentlemen are welcome. See that they're treated well. \n[44]Let's see, shall we? What do you bring me? \n[45]Mud and leaves? \n[46]Continue. \n[47]The fruits of piracy after all, it seems. \n[48]Well, well. A political pirate. A logic-chopping pirate. \n[49]But not my best dressed. \n[50]I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. \n[51]They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it. \n[52]Bess. \n[53]He interests me. Talk to him. \n[54]Him. \n[55]His highness is tired after his journey. \n[56]young friend. But don't you sometimes feel an overwhelming desire to say what you're really thinking?) \n[57]\n[58]His highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to rest. \n[59]He's a sweet boy. I don't want him hurt by your schemes. \n[60]I suspect him of being a professional charmer. Am I right? \n[61]There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms? \n[62]Which I'm to pay for, no doubt. You like him, don't you? \n[63]So it is. We shall let him come again. \n[64]Let them wait! Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping. \n[65]The Queen does not have a private life. \n[66]The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage. \n[67]a hurry to grow old. Youth is so very precious. \n[68]Mr. Raleigh. \n[69]I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us? \n[70]I like you, Mr Raleigh. \n[71]You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him. \n[72]And what have you to say about it?       R \n[73]Is the mission not the man? \n[74]Go on. \n[75]Now you become dull. \n[76]You have - the stronger horse. \n[77]The Queen does not give way to others. \n[78]Have you ever known your place, Mr. Raleigh? \n[79]I'm surprised you're not married yet. \n[80]And can sailors not be lovers? \n[81]Ah, I see. You like love better than marriage. That I understand. \n[82]When I marry, I marry for my country. When I love, I love for myself. You have had many loves, I think. \n[83]You've yet to meet your equal? \n[84]You want a friend, not just an equal. You want someone to share your joy when you're happy. \n[85]Someone to cry with when you're sad. Someone to talk to when there's nothing to say. Someone to find by your side when you wake in the night. Someone who remembers what you once were, when you've grown old. \n[86]Ah yes. I know all about it. There. I'm rested now. \n[87]We can be something to each other, I hope, Mr. Raleigh. \n[88]Alright, then. I will. \n[89]See! You lie! You don't want me on your ship at all. You're a liar! \n[90]Would you like to go to sea, Bess? \n[91]Oh, do they? \n[92]Men have needs? \n[93]Then let them stay on land and see to their needs. Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we? \n[94]No, don't stop. I like it. \n[95]Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself? \n[96]Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen. \n[97]Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that? \n[98]And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no \n[99]Filled with declarations of love? \n[100]If she wants my love, let her deserve it. Refused. \n[101]Mr Raleigh. I've kept you waiting. \n[102]There is always other business. But I have been waiting too. \n[103]Yes, Walsingham? \n[104]Forgive me, sir. As you see, my time is not my own. \n[105]What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador? \n[106]It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and - \n[107]And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne. \n[108]I am to be assassinated. Does any of this sound familiar? \n[109]I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country. \n[110]You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets. \n[111]I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me! \n[112]What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen! \n[113]You ask permission to go. \n[114]You plan to return to the New World. To your colony. For two, or three, or four years. \n[115]That is a long time. \n[116]But you're quite wrong. You are needed here. I have decided to appoint you Captain of my personal guard. \n[117]Kneel. \n[118]Rise, Sir Walter Raleigh. \n[119]Well? You may express your gratitude. \n[120]If it's such an honour, why are you staring at your boots? \n[121]Now you stare at the wall. Am I so old and hideous that you can't even look me in the face? \n[122]My friend, forgive me. I'm a vain and foolish woman. At court it's all a game. I like to be admired. I require it. I grow accustomed to it. But it's all - nothing. \n[123]You come here as if from another world, and I - You have real adventures, you go where the maps end. I would follow you there if I could, believe me. \n[124]The storm clouds are gathering, my friend. Please don't leave me now. \n[125]\n[126]Princes of the female gender. \n[127]Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you. So what does it all mean? \n[128]Which empire is to rise, and which is to fall? \n[129]He means, Will I be assassinated? \n[130]You see, Francis? This is a mystery. He has no patience with mysteries. W \n[131]Francis. Leave us for a moment. \n[132]And the private life of this prince of the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this too a mystery? \n[133]Do the stars not foretell matters of state? \n[134]Have I reason to fear? \n[135]An art, not a science. I understand. \n[136]Let him throw you round, Bess. You can trust him. \n[137]Sometimes. Do you think that wrong? \n[138]To tell you the truth, Mr Raleigh, there are times when I'm tired of being always in control. \n[139]What? \n[140]Do you say so? \n[141]Bess, you must try a dance with Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us his skill. \n[142]Oh, it's very simple. \n[143]You stand like this, with your hands firmly clasped here - and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing her round - once, twice, three times - and you're back to the beginning. What could be simpler? \n[144]So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your position. I am to be obeyed. \n[145]Hold her tight. I don't want her dropped. Play! \n[146]Leave her alone, Walsingham. I want both of them left alone. \n[147]They say she's taller than me. Her hair is chestnut in colour. Her eyes are hazel. They say she's beautiful. But people lie. They say I am beautiful. \n[148]Yes, it's true. I've read her letters. I too was a prisoner once. I've feared for my life. I've done terrible things - just to live. \n[149]I can be merciful. But she protests her innocence, and that is a lie. Why will she not admit she has wronged me? \n[150]You used to be gentler, Bess. \n[151]Must die? Mary Stuart must die? Where is it written? Who dares to give orders to the Queen? \n[152]Don't preach at me, old man. Look at you! You can hardly stand. Go home to your wife. Go home to your bed. \n[153]The law is for common men, not for princes. \n[154]My friend. \n[155]Did Bess bid you come? Have you too come to tell me I must murder a Queen? \n[156]My duty? Was it my father's duty to murder my mother? I would be loath to die so bloody a death. \n[157]Yes, I am afraid. I am always afraid. \n[158]You understand me well. \n[159]Do we? Do we really? \n[160]I owe England my life. Don't ask for my soul. \n[161]I want it stopped! \n[162]No! It must be stopped! \n[163]Not me! \n[164]And I ordered her execution. I murdered God's anointed Queen. And now God's most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me. \n[165]Yes... Go... \n[166]`Think you that there is any certainty in the affairs of mankind, when you know that one swift hour can destroy the greatest among us?' \n[167]Boethius. \n[168]Thank you for coming at this late hour. \n[169]We're at war. Who knows when we'll meet again. If we'll meet again. \n[170]The same God in whose name Philip wages his holy war. Philip is a righteous man, and righteous men love to destroy. They burn whole worlds to make them pure, and leave behind - ashes. \n[171]He may. His Armada is invincible, they say. If London falls, I fall. If England is lost, I am lost. \n[172]Never? It's night. My thoughts turn dark. Don't you ever think that one day, perhaps one day soon, you too will die? \n[173]Today. Tonight. \n[174]I wish - \n[175]In some other time, in some other world, could you have loved me? \n[176]Then there's... something you could do for me - something I've not known for a very long time - if you felt so inclined - \n[177]A kiss? \n[178]Air! I must have air! \n[179]This Spanish Armada is at sea carrying an army of ten thousand men. The Duke of Parma has fifteen thousand men on the French coast. \n[180]But they don't yet have enough barges at Calais. We have a little time. \n[181]Our forces defend the Thames entrance at Tilbury. How many men? \n[182]You may observe, Walsingham, that I don't see my way with only one eye. Nor do I hop along on only one leg. Why then would I rely on only one source of information? \n[183]Where is she? \n[184]Bess! Bess Throckmorton! \n[185]Tell me! Is it true? Are you married? Are you with child? Are you WITH CHILD? \n[186]You traitress! You dare to have secrets from me! I am your Queen! You ask my permission before you rut - before you marry - before you breed! My bitches wear my collars! Do you hear me? How dare you be with child! \n[187]This is no time for mercy! That's what you said to me. I don't forget. But you showed mercy, Walsingham! Go to your traitor brother, and leave me to my business! \n[188]Is it his child? Tell me! Say it! Is the child his? Tell me! Say it! Is it his? \n[189]This gentleman has seduced a lady under my care. This lady has married without my consent. These are offences punishable by law. Arrest him. \n[190]The fall of an empire, you told me. Did you mean the English empire? Because by God, England will not fall while I am Queen! If that's your prophecy, sir, prophesy again! \n[191]I will not be a toy of the fates! Have I not faced an assassin's bullet and lived? \n[192]You're a wise man, Dr Dee. \n[193]My lords, I can offer you no words of comfort. \n[194]If this Armada succeeds there will be no more freedom in our land, and England will be no more. We cannot be defeated. \n[195]Labourers are to leave the fields and take up arms. The harvest must wait. \n[196]Release all prisoners. England is their country too. \n[197]Release Raleigh. He is forgiven... As I too pray to be forgiven... \n[198]Leave me. All of you. \n[199]Are our ships at sea? Has the fleet left Plymouth? That can't be so hard to know. \n[200]With what gain? \n[201]Then we must act. \n[202]My loving people! We see the sails of the enemy approaching. We hear the Spanish guns over the water. \n[203]Soon now we will meet them face to face. In that encounter, England lives, or England dies. I am resolved in the midst and heat of the battle to live or die amongst you all! \n[204]While we stand together no invader shall pass. Let them come with all the armies of Hell, they will not pass. \n[205]So let us sound the advance and go forward, together, you and I. I myself will be your general, judge and rewarder of every one of your virtues in the field. When this day of battle is ended, we meet again in heaven, or on the field of victory. \n[206]One empire will rise, and one will fall... \n[207]Francis. My old friend. \n[208]I know it, old friend. Don't leave me now. \n[209]You always did do as you pleased, whether I wanted it or not. I've no doubt you'll do as you please now. \n[210]When was the birth? \n[211]The mother is well? \n[212]And the child? \n[213]Your Elizabeth has a child. You must be proud. \n[214]And fulfilled? \n[215]And do you still dream of your shining city, your New World? ", "RALEIGH": "\n[1]Let England know we're back, Mr Calley. \n[2]She spoke to me. You have to give me that. \n[3]Two words. \n[4]Did you see the girl behind her? I've been at sea too long. \n[5]How am I to see him if you won't let me through? \n[6]And when will he come out? \n[7]I had less trouble than this boarding a Spanish ship! Everything is easier when you can kill people. \n[8]Walter Raleigh, your majesty. \n[9]A gentleman of Devon. \n[10]The honour to be in the presence of my Queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English people. \n[11]I ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of England. \n[12]Americans, majesty. They long to be your newest subjects. \n[13]None to match England's Queen. \n[14]I also come bearing gifts for your majesty, from the New World. \n[15]Mud, and leaves. \n[16]Patata, majesty. You eat it. Very nourishing. \n[17]Gold. You spend it. Very satisfying. \n[18]Courtesy of a Spanish ship, that found itself unable to complete its journey. \n[19]Philip of Spain is no friend of England, majesty. The more gold I take from him, the safer you will be. \n[20]And your majesty's most loyal subject. \n[21]What did you think of her? \n[22]But magnificent. \n[23]I'm glad to have the opportunity to thank you. Without your help, I'd still be in outer darkness. \n[24]Then I thank you for the very little. \n[25]No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command. \n[26]Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence. \n[27]That depends what you propose to do with them. \n[28]A simple sailor, dazzled by the bright lights. \n[29]\n[30]I don't presume to raise my eyes so high. \n[31]It seems you're determined to think the worst of me. \n[32]What every man wants. Money. Fame. Love. \n[33]Each leads to the next. The money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World. The success of my infant colony there will make me famous. The fame will bring me love. \n[34]There are benefits along the way. It is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city. \n[35]No doubt. B \n[36]May I ask a question in return? \n[37]How am I to win the Queen's favour? \n[38]I've little enough to offer, I know. But whatever I have to give - ask, and it's yours. \n[39]I don't even know your name. \n[40]A second Elizabeth. \n[41]It begins with a journey. You must cross an ocean. \n[42]Can you imagine - can you feel - what it is to cross an ocean? For weeks you see nothing but the horizon. All round you. Perfect, and empty. Your ship is small - tiny - a speck in such immensity. \n[43]You live with fear, in the grip of fear - fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What if you never escape? How can you escape? There's nowhere to go. So you must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts, and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope. \n[44]Pure naked fragile hope, when all your senses scream at you, Lost! Lost! Imagine it. Day after day, staring west, the rising sun on your back, the setting sun in your eyes, hoping, hoping - \n[45]At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do that, and storms. So you watch, you watch. \n[46]Then it's a smudge, a shadow on the far water. For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself believe. You dare to whisper the word - land! \n[47]Land. Life. Resurrection. The true adventure. Coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into safe harbour at last. That - that - is the New World. \n[48]She listened as if she understood me. \n[49]You speak like a true explorer. \n[50]And I like you. \n[51]Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward. \n[52]I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself. \n[53]Mine! \n[54]Whoa! Whoa! Forgive me, majesty. My horse doesn't know his place yet \n[55]I'm a sailor, majesty. \n[56]Must lovers be husbands? \n[57]Your majesty is not eager to be married? \n[58]Some... \n[59]I would want someone who knows me as I am. \n[60]So why don't you? \n[61]I'm afraid that's not possible. Women bring bad luck on board ship. \n[62]Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad. \n[63]You think all I want is money. \n[64]You think I'm a cynical adventurer, with little breeding and less education. You're wrong. I'm a cynical adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education. \n[65]You have more important concerns than me. \n[66]The Queen has sent you to me. \n[67]Tell the Queen that I will trouble her no more. As soon as my ship's repairs are complete I will ask permission to sail. \n[68]I need no assurances. I'm no courtier and never have been. I've lost my appetite for playing games that it seems I'm too stupid to understand. \n[69]You call me unfair! \n[70]Very well. What is my Queen's command? \n[71]Yes, majesty. \n[72]If your majesty grants me your royal warrant. \n[73]There's nothing left for me to do here. At sea I know what I'm to do, I know the risks, I know the rewards. Here - \n[74]Captain of your - ! \n[75]This is too great an honour. \n[76]You know why. \n[77]Why do you talk like a fool when you're anything but a fool? \n[78]I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. \n[79]Something has distressed you. \n[80]So you did.  \n[81]That's necessity. That's the world we live in. \n[82]If you knew him well, you will have sensed the truth. \n[83]He was hoping to use you. You did what you had to do. \n[84]There, now. \n[85]We're all mortal, Bess. We do what we can. \n[86]You like your ladies to jump at your command? \n[87]No, no. You're the Queen. You are to be obeyed. \n[88]Nonsense. \n[89]You don't mean a word of it. You eat and drink control. \n[90]No skill at all, majesty. I don't know the steps. \n[91]As your majesty wishes. \n[92]Has she asked for me? \n[93]My Queen. \n[94]No. You don't need me to instruct you in your duty. \n[95]Since when were you so afraid? \n[96]You fear your soul will be touched. Royalty is close to immortality. Kill a Queen - and queens are mortal. \n[97]We mortals have many weaknesses. We feel too much. Hurt too much. And all too soon, we die. But we do have the chance of love. \n[98]The Consolation of Philosophy. \n[99]May the Lord God preserve England's Queen. \n[100]He'll not burn England. \n[101]Never! \n[102]The closer I come to death, the more I want to live. The hungrier I am for life. \n[103]Why be afraid of tomorrow? Today's all we have, and all we know. \n[104]Now. \n[105]I've never known a woman like you. \n[106]I know only one world. In this world, I have loved you. \n[107]What is this, Bess? \n[108]You're pregnant? \n[109]You can't go! \n[110]When were you planning to leave? \n[111]Am I not to see you again? What's to become of the child? Bess - \n[112]All I know is nothing's as it should be. \n[113]Of course I remember. \n[114]Oh, Bess... \n[115]With this ring I thee wed. With my body I thee worship... \n[116]... and with all my worldly goods \n[117]In the name of the father - \n[118]And of the Son - \n[119]And of the Holy Spirit. \n[120]Amen. \n[121]This is not the Queen I love and serve. \n[122]What news? Is the fleet at sea? \n[123]What news? \n[124]And the fleet? \n[125]All but me. \n[126]Tell the Queen I will join my ship. \n[127]Our ships may be smaller but they're nimbler. We should use the strengths we've got. \n[128]Break their formation and we have a chance. \n[129]We have the wind in our favour. Do we go? \n[130]How many ships are burning? \n[131]Not enough. \n[132]May God be with us all tonight. \n[133]\n[134]Thank God. \n[135]My son is well. \n[136]Yes. \n[137]As any man can be. \n[138]I would be honoured. ", "BESS": "\n[1]Not too soon, my lady. \n[2]I'll want the marriage if I want the man. \n[3]An honest man. With friendly eyes. \n[4]And sweet breath. \n[5]Smile lines, my lady. \n[6]I beg your majesty's forgiveness. \n[7]\n[8]He's rather sweet. \n[9]Well, wouldn't you? \n[10]I did very little, sir. You'd already caught the Queen's eye. \n[11]Him, my lady? \n[12]The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court, I hope. \n[13]If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment - \n[14]That can only mean the Queen. \n[15]It seems you've presumed after all. \n[16]Tell me what it is you really want. \n[17]In that order? \n[18]It seems rather a long way round. \n[19]Which you will no doubt name after yourself. \n[20]Of course. \n[21]Why should I tell you that, sir? \n[22]My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible.

He dreams of building a shining city. \n[27]It's refreshing to meet a man who looks to a world beyond the court. \n[28]Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour? \n[29]I expect I'll think of something. \n[30]George! What's wrong? Is your father alright? \n[31]I was worried. You must send me no more letters.

I thought you more of a man than that. And I thought you a better friend to the Queen. Her every move is watched by a hundred eyes. Assassins plot to kill her. Enemies prepare to overwhelm her country. And you say she's playing games? \n[46]Go to her, sir. As her friend. \n[47]Oh! It's you! \n[48]My prayer's done. \n[49]And I thought I prayed in silence. \n[50]A man was hanged today. A Papist. I knew him well. He was my cousin. He died because I gave information. I gave information to prove my loyalty. Because I was afraid. \n[51]He told me he wanted to change. Become part of the new England. I was afraid that he was lying to me. But what if - what if it was true? \n[52]What if I was his last hope? What if I was the one person he thought he could trust? \n[53]I thought so. \n[54]Please! I'm innocent! I've always been a loyal servant of the Queen. I'd never betray the Queen, never - \n[55]She plotted to kill you. \n[56]So do we all. \n[57]She'll go on lying til you cut out her traitor's heart. \n[58]I used to be quieter, majesty. \n[59]Thank God you've come. I've never seen her so distressed. She's been alone in her rooms since morning. She'll see no one. \n[60]No. But she needs you. I know she does. \n[61]I'll be quick. I have something to tell you. But I ask for nothing. Is that understood? Your life is your own. Nothing will change. \n[62]I'm - \n[63]No one knows. My plans are made. I shall ask the Queen for permission to leave court. I shall live quietly in the country with - with my child. The Queen must know nothing. \n[64]To my mother's house. \n[65]I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't court a man without her permission. I can't marry without her permission. As for having a child - \n[66]As soon as I'm allowed. \n[67]Hush! We've no choice. You know it as well as I do. \n[68]Please listen. You once said to me, `Whatever I have to give, ask and it's yours.' Do you remember? \n[69]I ask that you forget me. Go to your ship. Do your duty.

France. Sweden. \n[8]I confine myself to the possible. \n[9]They care for your safety, majesty. The threats to your person are real. \n[10]France is in religious turmoil. It would be unwise to engage with their instability. \n[11]We still need to keep France out of the arms of Spain. \n[12]Still madly in love with you. \n[13]A cousin of Philip II of Spain. \n[14]And it would put Philip on a leash. \n[15]Virginity is an asset that holds its value well. \n[16]William! \n[17]You look terrible.

You must take care of yourself. \n[19]You'll dine with us? You'll lodge with us? \n[20]I speak to her daily. \n[21]I can't leave court yet.

Will the great breach in the church ever be healed? \n[24]\n[25]\n[26]Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The Queen chooses to show you favour. You naturally wish to take advantage of that. Don't ask for too much. \n[27]I hope all you want is money. \n[28]I begin to see why the Queen likes you. \n[29]Still nothing to tell me, Mr Throckmorton? \n[30]I know about the Enterprise. I need names. But if you won't help me, perhaps your father will. \n[31]He's been questioned, as you have. I do have to know, you see. \n[32]Well? \n[33]Majesty. \n[34]The traitor has talked, majesty. The traitor Throckmorton. \n[35]Norfolk. \n[36]Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more specific calamities that we can guard against? \n[37]Queens are mortal. \n[38]But you have, my dear. And you do. We both know that. \n[39]Keep me informed, and all will be well. I don't like surprises. \n[40]Where have you been? We haven't seen you for days. \n[41]From Paris, no doubt. \n[42]And now you've come back. \n[43]Do you know, I can still remember the day you were born? \n[44]I was eleven years old. And you, this helpless bundle. I looked at you in your crib, with your little wrinkled face, and I loved you from the first. I vowed then to look after you. I watched you grow up with your head in the clouds, always a dreamer. I couldn't follow you there. And now I've failed you, haven't I? Forgive me if I haven't loved you enough. \n[45]Did you really think I didn't know? \n[46]Was it for money? At least tell me you got a good price. \n[47]What then? What would you murder your own brother for? \n[48]Eternal life. The bribe no man can refuse. \n[49]Ready to die, I see, Jesuit. \n[50]Why was the gun not loaded? \n[51]Not quite everything. \n[52]You're no martyr. You weren't even much of a murderer. Go back to France. Back to your dreams. Never let me hear of you again. \n[53]The law must have its way. \n[54]Forgive me. In my weakness and my vanity, I have failed you. \n[55]Philip of Spain is a God-fearing man. He cannot make war without just cause. He sent the Jesuit to kill a Queen. But not you. \n[56]The Jesuit's mission was to draw Mary Stuart into the murder plot. He knew I was reading her every letter. He waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt. \n[57]Forgive me, majesty. Let me go. \n[58]They plan to cross the Channel in barges, under the protection of the Spanish fleet, and sail up the Thames. \n[59]That is so. \n[60]If the Spanish fleet reaches Calais in strength, the combined armies will be beyond our power to resist. \n[61]How did you know about the numbers of the Dutch barges, majesty? I don't recall supplying you with that information. \n[62]Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy - \n[63]The Spanish are barely a day away, majesty. \n[64]I beg you to appreciate the gravity of the situation, majesty.
