But don't worry--everything's in good shape downstairs. \n[9]You remember what I tol' you? \n[10]Nobody knows about my father and my brother--not even Jumbo. And it's gotta stay that way, you understand? \n[11]Nah.   Nah, I'm managing now. \n[12]Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright? \n[13]I changed my name--I use my mother's name now. It's better for business. C'mon... \n[14]That's them there. In the corner. Lookit `em--two peas in a pod. \n[15][My] Father's friends--they were all in Korea together. Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs... Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll get out quicker. \n[16]N--I just wanna get out quick, that's all... \n[17]Yeah I did so...congratulations... \n[18]Pop.

C'mon. \n[43]You're just like her, baby... \n[44]That's cool. \n[45]It's all right--they don't like nobody outside their own little world. \n[46]My brother and my father ain't like that. It's just--the whole thing ain't for me, that's all. \n[47]You know how gorgeous you are? \n[48]What is it? \n[49]...it's beautiful... \n[50]...you're so good to me... \n[51]Only if you behave yourself... \n[52]Uh oh--[The] party's really gonna get started now! \n[53]Any Spanish Fly in there for you? \n[54]I'm goin' up to see Buzhayev tonight.

Hi everybody... \n[58]Everything's really rockin' tonight. Line's halfway `round the block. \n[59]You wanted to talk to me? \n[60]'S a good move. \n[61]I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you. I mean, I got a lot of ideas. \n[62]Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami. \n[63]I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights? What do you think? \n[64]Yeah, sure.   I'll come. \n[65]Nah nah, no thank you... \n[66]Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots. \n[67]Well, just make sure you get your old co-workers from the Health Department to give us a pass on the kitchen. \n[68]Where's Rosario? \n[69]Goddamnit... [She's] With that fuckin' animal again. \n[70]Look at him... I'll tell you, [when] this is my place, we'll kick his fuckin' ass right outta here-- \n[71]Yeah, you know a lot. \n[72]You sure it wasn't your dick? \n[73]Shit... I'll be right back. \n[74]Things're goin' good. \n[75]He don't look like a middleweight no more. \n[76]Your uncle's a great man. Smart man. \n[77]Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy. \n[78]Yeah...I'll think about that. Rosario--I wanna talk to you. \n[79]You gotta stop dealing. You hear what I'm telling you? \n[80]You hear what I said? \n[81]Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons. \n[82]Gimme your shit! \n[83]Thanks a lot.    I appreciate it. \n[84]Okay, I'll go thank him too then. He comes in, raids the fuckin' place--now I gotta go beg `em not to fire me-- \n[85]Fuck you, Pop.    Fuck the both of you's. \n[86]You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna fuckin' touch me?!? \n[87]Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry about what happened the other night. [If] I was working, maybe I would've been able to do something, but... Anyway, I'm sorry. \n[88]You don't mind my saying, I think that's probably the right thing to do. Things get back to normal, I'm hoping we could get started on what we talked about. \n[89]Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. I don't got a record-- \n[90]Yeah...   All right... \n[91]You had to hit that spot. \n[92]I had plans down there. \n[93]You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop-- \n[94]What did you call her? \n[95]You piece of shit... \n[96]Fine with me, you motherfucker! \n[97]That ain't nothing. \n[98]We'll see you and bump you two C's. \n[99]Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking queens! \n[100]Who is it? \n[101]Hello? \n[102]Is--is he gonna be all right? \n[103]My brother was shot...they're operating on him now. \n[104]Game's over, everybody. \n[105]That's right.    I gotta go. \n[106]What're you doing? \n[107]No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. I'll call you later. \n[108]Don't argue. \n[109]Louis, lock up and take her home. \n[110]Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta do something, that's all-- \n[111]Pop? \n[112]Pop, he all right? \n[113]I need to see him... \n[114]You guys blaming me for this? Is that it? \n[115]That's bullshit--she's clean.      You fuckin' keep away from her. \n[116]Yeah.   That's me. \n[117]Look--I'm his brother, you fuckin' hard-on! \n[118]...Feels like it was my fault... \n[119]Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check. \n[120]Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago. \n[121]I didn't have nothing on me. \n[122]Your uncle's got some problems now, though. \n[123]Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip. \n[124]It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think? \n[125]Muscle--? \n[126]A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that. \n[127]I'll see you around... \n[128]I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky. \n[129]Pop, I gotta talk to you. \n[130]It's important--I got information. \n[131]It's about you. \n[132]It's bad. \n[133]Yeah... \n[134]Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him. \n[135]They been wanting me to buy in for a while. \n[136]What do you mean, set something up? \n[137]Pop? \n[138]You could trust her. \n[139]But...but you could get killed-- \n[140]Your mother's real important to you, ain't she. You'd do anything for her. \n[141]Go back to sleep... \n[142]You been up to see my brother...? \n[143]...How's that been goin'...? \n[144]Well I... I been thinking...if you could keep it confidential...? I'd make the connection for you. \n[145]They trust me--we could go in large, use my money for the buy, they won't suspect anything-- \n[146]He don't gotta know anything about it. Does he? \n[147]I know. It's just--I realized... ....my father dies `cause of all this, I couldn't live my life knowing I coulda done something. I know the same is true for you.   I know it is. \n[148]So please--can we do this...? \n[149]Hey.  It's Bobby Green. I decided--I wanna buy in. \n[150]Fifty k, to start. \n[151]Sounds good. \n[152]Okay.   I'll see you tomorrow. \n[153]Most expensive phone call I ever made. \n[154]You need to promise me something, though. You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better. \n[155]I'll take care of it. \n[156]You gonna leave me all alone out there? \n[157]You come up with that one all by yourself? \n[158]I--I need to talk to you. \n[159]I--I'm gonna inform. For the police. I'm gonna help `em set up Nezhinski. \n[160]I had to do it, Rosario. These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father. \n[161]He ain't ever gonna find out.    He ain't ever gonna know. \n[162]I don't know... I'd, I'd probably have to go into protection. \n[163]But that's never gonna happen! \n[164]Rosario, listen--I had to do it. \n[165]I had to do it... \n[166]Everything's gonna be all right... Don't worry, it'll be all right... \n[167]Yeah... Sorry, buddy--I got some legal shit to deal with, from the raid... But I ain't forgot about you--I'll be back soon. \n[168]No, it's okay--I'll talk to him later... \n[169]Where's Vadim. \n[170]Well, I got fifty grand in here. And it don't move `less I deal with the man himself. So [if] you're interested, I wanna see your stash, right now. No bullshit. \n[171]You know me. \n[172]That's all the money I got.    And I ain't gonna leave it alone. \n[173]From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin. \n[174]Sounds good. \n[175]I took a little taste. \n[176]I'm clean. \n[177]You wanna search me again, you go `head. I just wanna make this deal and go home. \n[178]I'm gonna get pussy from this... \n[179][When] this deal goes down, I'm, I'm gonna get a lotta pussy... \n[180]I'm with you!     I'm with YOU! \n[181]I'll be all right, Pop. \n[182]I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me. \n[183]Yeah. They let me come--long as I brought these guys with me. \n[184]Good... It's rehabbing good, for only nine weeks. Don't matter, I wasn't no Fred Astaire before. \n[185]Anyway, it ain't nothing compared to my brother, so... \n[186]Just hold on, `til he gets here. \n[187]I'm not sure yet... We been thinking about moving down to Miami. Guy I used to work for, his brother's got a place down there. \n[188]A lotta kids here, lotta family... It's nice, ain't it...? \n[189]You know how happy I am you're with me? \n[190]I'm real glad you're home... \n[191]What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something? \n[192]You fucked up? \n[193]We gotta straighten this out later. \n[194]That don't mean nothing. \n[195]There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep. \n[196]I'll be outside if you need me. \n[197]Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready. \n[198]\n[199]No, come on! I don't want that! What I did, I did for you guys, this once. I got my own plans. \n[200]Take me back to the motel. \n[201]Rosario?    Rosario! \n[202]\n[203]The cops're right outside--let's go. I said, let's go! \n[204]Lou--no more of this for her.   It's too fuckin' dangerous now. \n[205]Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll call you. But right now I need to get her outta here. \n[206]You gotta put everything in jeopardy? Huh? \n[207]You know, I don't think you realize how serious this is? \n[208]We gotta ride this out, `til this fuckin' thing is over. `Til I can get things back on track. \n[209]I know. But I'm workin' on it, I am. Soon as the trial's over and I get my money back outta impound-- everything'll get better, you'll see. \n[210]Rosario--once this's done, we'll go down to Miami... [It'll] be a new thing for us--a lotta opportunities... I'll talk to Mr. Buzhayev about working for his brother down there. We'll get your mother to come too-- I'll even talk to Jumbo about it. \n[211]C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise... \n[212]Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant. \n[213]I'd appreciate it. \n[214]You always been very important to me too. I should probably go now. \n[215]Yeah, maybe. Why don't we give `em all these bags to throw out--it's becoming a mess. \n[216]What's goin' on? \n[217]What--? \n[218]Jesus...   What about-- \n[219]You see something out there? \n[220]Pop?   Joe come close this morning? \n[221]Yeah, maybe.   But you know the way he is. \n[222]I know, Pop. \n[223]It's really coming down... \n[224]Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right! \n[225]Get down! \n[226]Rosario!   You hurt? \n[227]Pop, lay back! \n[228]Don't fuckin' look at him! I said don't--back up! Don't look at him... \n[229]Does my brother know yet? \n[230]Then you gotta take me to him... I wanna go see him... \n[231]Joseph? \n[232]I don't know if I can do that.   I \n[233]I wanna stay close to you from now on, Joe... I wanna stay with you... \n[234]You gonna fuckin' catch these guys? \n[235]You ain't got nothing, do you. \n[236]You gotta find that spot... \n[237]Course... \n[238]No.... I did it to hurt him...   I disappointed him... \n[239]I can't live like this no more, Mike... They destroyed my family. There's a deal going down, I... I wanna help... \n[240]I, I could join you. \n[241]My Pop tol' me you pull guys outta the Academy, guys with special knowledge, [and] make `em cops? You could do that. \n[242]No.   I can't do nothing else now. \n[243]I know. \n[244]Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just decided... Okay? \n[245]This is where I belong... \n[246]I wanna talk to you about something. \n[247]I'm thinking of...maybe joining the Force. \n[248]I mean, I help find Nezhinski, we don't gotta live like this the rest of our lives--moving every three fuckin' days... \n[249]What're you talking about? I just got through telling you-- \n[250]\n[251]Hold on a second--I know what I'm talking about'd be a change. It'd be a big change for us. \n[252]But we could make a life here. This'd be something we could build on. We could raise a family, and... \n[253]Pretty soon you'd fit in. \n[254]They'll accept you if we're \n[255]Gave it up? Gave up what? \n[256]What fuckin' life did you have? You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at you! \n[257]Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time! \n[258]Wake up!   All that was nothing! \n[259]My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me. \n[260]Hey--where you goin'-- \n[261]What the fuck you doin'? \n[262]All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little. \n[263]You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you. Why don't you go get some rest? \n[264]Thank you, sir. I'm gonna try and do my part too, now. \n[265]\"I, Robert Green, hereby pledge and \n[266]\"--that I will support and defend the Constitution, both of the United States government and the State of New York, to the best of my ability...\" \n[267]\"...I will faithfully discharge my duties in the rank of rider in the New York City Police Department.

I wanna talk to my brother. \n[270]You're trying to do everything-- it's gonna kill you. \n[271]We could handle it. I mean, I come on to help you-- \n[272]I know. But you don't gotta do everything yourself. That's what I'm trying to tell you. \n[273]Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you can tell me. A deal this big, something's gonna come up. You'll see--someone'll fold. \n[274]Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's meant to be. You can't fuckin' control it... \n[275]Tell her I'm on my way back now. Don't worry. \n[276]That's all in the past. I'll see you later. \n[277]What happened--where'd she go?!? \n[278]We gotta go find her! \n[279]\n[280]Go `head!   Keep me in here--KEEP ME \n[281]You gonna keep me here? HUH?!? \n[282]It's me, Lou. \n[283]I'm okay. Listen uh, you ain't spoke to Rosario lately, have you? \n[284]Thanks... You know, things are really changing on my end. I ain't gonna be in protection anymore. \n[285]...I, I don't know... \n[286]No... \n[287]Jumbo, I don't want nothing right now--don't worry about it. \n[288]Okay, Eli.   Tell him I'll come up. \n[289]Rosario--Rosario's gone down to Florida for a little while. \n[290]Yeah... You know, I was just thinking `bout when I first met her here... Working back there... \n[291]Louis--? How'd you know where I was staying? \n[292]How'd you know where I was staying? \n[293]It wasn't in no papers, Louis. Don't make me embarrass you. Let's go outside, right now. \n[294]Where's Nezhinski? \n[295]Don't play games with me, Louis. \n[296]I just said, DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH \n[297]You don't mean nothing to me now-- that part of my life is dead. Today it ended for good... \n[298]You know my father is dead because of you? \n[299]You know I'm on the Force now? And I could do anything to you? \n[300]You tell me what you know right now or I swear to Christ I will make you disappear. \n[301]You tell me, right now-- Where's your fuckin' spot?!? \n[302]Well, he said tomorrow and that's what matters. \n[303]They got one year of experience, repeated 25 times. \n[304]Pop would never bring `em in, Joe. We gotta see this through ourselves... \n[305]All right, c'mon. Enough... \n[306]We're gonna get all of `em today. \n[307]Lookit the two of them...they're so fuckin' close... \n[308]You're surrounded by the police! Come out now, with your hands on your heads! \n[309]Joe?! \n[310]Arright, just stay down! \n[311]Vadim is in here with us. Radio our guys, tell `em to get into the clearing. \n[312]Are all our guys out? \n[313]Burn it. \n[314]I'm not gonna let him get away... \n[315]Get down!   On the ground! \n[316]Put him in the fuckin' van... Don't touch him... \n[317]Hey everybody... \n[318]All right.   We'll talk about that after. \n[319]They're getting started--we should probably go in now. \n[320]I don't think he'd believe it... But I guess things don't always go the way you think they will. \n[321]You definitely gonna leave? Ain't no way you change your mind? \n[322]Listen, we'll spend some more time together from now on. Okay? I'll come over next week. \n[323]Chaplain? I'd like you to introduce me this way. If you don't mind. \n[324]Love you too, Joe. ", "JOSEPH GRUSINSKY": "\n[1]Pop, they got enough! What're you doin'?!? \n[2]He ain't gonna come. \n[3]How you doing... \n[4]Feels like nothin'. Nah, it feels good! I love trying to, you know, help make the City safer for people and everything... \n[5]Bobby, hey! You, you got off work and everything-- \n[6]Bobby, I asked Pop to bring you here. \n[7]Well... I'm gonna be heading up a new narcotics team, starting this week. A Russian unit, outta PSA 2 in Brighton. \n[8]Yeah, they need me over there. There's only eleven guys in the whole department that even know the language right now, so... \n[9]Bobby, we need you to do us a favor. \n[10]\n[11]We're looking at this guy Vadim Nezhinski. \n[12]He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust... Operates out of that club you manage. The El Caribe. \n[13]No, we know that. We checked up and down the rest of management, too--his uncle, the owner-- \n[14]Everybody come up clean. It's just Nezhinski we're lookin' at. \n[15]We need to track how he's bringin' in the product and...we were just hopin' you'd keep your eyes and ears open a little. \n[16]No, we would never ask you to do that. Just observe, that's all. It's a closed community and you're our only way in right now-- \n[17]Nothing's gonna get fucked up, Bobby. All it takes is one thing, you know that! One guy to flip, we crack the whole thing! \n[18]Whole city's falling apart, Bobby-- don't you got any sense of responsibility at all? \n[19]Thanks for coming. \n[20]Just be careful out there next coupla weeks. \n[21]Thank you everybody for coming-- happy Thanksgiving. Before I say anything else... We got some bad news this morning. \n[22]One of our Irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night--detective Edward Conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on Northern Boulevard. The clock's about to strike ten, so I thought we might give a moment of silence to remember. \n[23]Good. I just wanna make sure we take it easy in there. We don't want no panic. \n[24]It's his day off. He ain't gonna be there. \n[25]Everybody! Get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move! Turn off that music. Right now! \n[26]Give everybody a toss. G.Q.-- \n[27]Too much pizza, right there. \n[28]Turn around...    Turn around! \n[29]What is this? Want me to double your money? Huh? \n[30]Okay.   It's doubled now, how's that. \n[31]You got a cross AND a Jewish star on you? \n[32]What's the star for? \n[33]Okay, let's go. You. And you-- You're under arrest, possession and sale of narcotics-- \n[34]Your boy's gonna turn. And then we'll come back for you. \n[35]He stabbed himself, he was a bundle guy. Mighta known how they're movin' it. See, that's the key-- \n[36]We waited `til it was your day off. We had to go--I'm sorry. \n[37]Nezhinski was seen there, Bobby!
