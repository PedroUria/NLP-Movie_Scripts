It's how we know how important they are to us. \n[206]They come with the house... \n[207]You're crying... \n[208]You chose something to do... something so special... so unique... there was such a short period of time that you could do it... Even if nothing had happened ... Sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now... \n[209]You're still beautiful to watch... \n[210]We finally caught up to each other... \n[211]Stay just like that... I want to remember what we look like right now. \n[212]I'm not hiding it. \n[213]What if it has...what if its like me?... \n[214]I want to be father... not a little brother...

Does she dance? \n[229]I suppose that would be from my side of things. \n[230]Just what you can see. \n[231]I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the avenue. I have no idea what I'm going to do. \n[232]Hello? \n[233]Please... \n[234]I don't know what I'm doing here...What I expected...? \n[235]I never once stopped loving you... \n[236]Some things you don't ever forget... the feel... the taste... \n[237]... the smell... \n[238]... the touch... \n[239]Of someone you love...

Just kept going, year after year after year... \n[18]Was there just company? \n[19]Caroline... \n[20]Did you know turkeys aren't really birds...? \n[21]They're in the pheasant family. They can hardly fly. It's sad don't you think? A bird, that can't fly. \n[22]She's going to have a baby, silly. That's what my mother said when I was going to have a little brother.

It was glorious... \n[104]But Benjamin was never far from my thoughts... \n[105]Goodnight, Benjamin... \n[106]What did he say? \n[107]Who told you? \n[108]That was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that I was alright. \n[109]My God, look at you. You're perfect.... \n[110]I wish you hadn't. I wish you hadn't come here. \n[111]I don't want you to see me like this... \n[112]What home? Who's we? I'm not going back to New Orleans. New Orleans is your home... I don't have a home... I haven't been home for five years... I'm not going anywhere with you... \n[113]Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... But it wasn't supposed to be like this... \n[114]Do you understand, I don't want to be with you... I tried to tell you that in New York... You just don't listen... \n[115]We're not little children playing under the table... Remember, when you came to New York. You didn't belong there. I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now! I want you to leave! I'm not going anywhere with you! I want you to stay out of my life! \n[116]I was awfully cruel.

People sitting and drinking and talking... I lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life... about people... about home... until I fall asleep. \n[120]A man would go up and clean it. Try and fix what was broken. \n[121]Don't you want to know where I've been? \n[122]It was what I needed to do for myself. \n[123]She's still taking care of you. \n[124]You're not talking. You haven't said more than two words to me. \n[125]Sleep with me. \n[126]Yes. \n[127]Are you sure you don't want to know?... \n[128]I lived in Lyon... \n[129]...I learned to walk again \n[130]...I worked in a flower shop... \n[131]...I went to American movies a lot. \n[132]You won't hurt me... \n[133]We wouldn't have this... We wouldn't be here... It happened when it was supposed to happen... \n[134]Don't say that. \n[135]That's easy for you to say... You'll have plenty of chances. \n[136]I'm going to enjoy every moment I have with you... \n[137]Bet I can stay out here longer than you can. \n[138]You barely have a line, a crease, or a wrinkle... Everyday I have more wrinkles you have less... \n[139]What does it feel like growing younger? \n[140]Will you still love me when I can't stand straight... when my skin grows old and spotted... \n[141]Will you still love me when my step gets slow... when I sleep too much... when you have to push me in a chair... \n[142]Maybe some things last... \n[143]Maybe it's something you can't see... \n[144]I'm cold, Benjamin... \n[145]Goodnight, Benjamin. \n[146]Caroline? \n[147]Dear Robert... some time after that... \n[148]He knew enough.

The chimney leaked smoke... We didn't care... Oh don't stop dear... don't stop... \n[152]It's just the chlorine... \n[153]I don't like getting old. \n[154]I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again... \n[155]I don't remember if I turned the lights off. Did I leave the heater on? \n[156]You have the most beautiful eyes. \n[157]Peace. \n[158]Dancing is all about the line... the line of your body...after awhile... you lose the line... and you can never get it back... \n[159]I figured out if you were born in 1918... 49 years ago... I'm 43... we're almost the same age... In three years we'll meet in the middle... \n[160]I thought I was far too old... I'm pregnant... \n[161]The child... \n[162]I want to breathe on my own... Please... sit down, my darling... \n[163]I'm pregnant. \n[164]Hmmm... \n[165]I thought I heard the nurse slip, and say \"he...\" \n[166]I know you're afraid. \n[167]Okay.   What's your worst fear? \n[168]Then we'll love it all the more... \n[169]I'm going to make this work... This is what I want, and I want it with you... \n[170]Would you tell a blind man he can't have children? You will be a father for as long as you can. I know the consequences. I accepted that. Your love, loving you, is worth everything to me.

It's alright to forget things... \n[224]I wish you'd come down... \n[225]You're right, you can see everything sweetheart... \n[226]I think you better come down... \n[227]I knew a man who could fly.

I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my \"golden years.\" \n[5]I loved her very much. She was my mother. \n[6]Some nights, I would have to sleep alone. \n[7]I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All the people sleeping. I felt safe. \n[8]Breakfast was served promptly at six. \n[9]Dinner was served promptly at six. \n[10]On Saturday nights I would go to Queenie's church... \n[11]Now, when I look back on it, it was kind of miraculous... But you know the saying, \"...the Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh away...\" \n[12]There were birthdays... \n[13]You could hear when someone left us... there was a silence in the house... \n[14]For everyone that died, someone would come to take their place... \n[15]It was Thanksgiving 1930, I met the person who changed my life forever. \n[16]I never forgot her blue eyes... \n[17]\"...When the baby came things were different...\" \n[18]I moved into my own room in the attic... I realized, despite a house filled with people that I loved, I was alone... \n[19]I spent a lot of time by myself that year... \n[20]As hard as I try, I can't remember her name. Mrs. Lawson, or Mrs. Hartford, or maybe it was Maple? It's funny how sometimes the people we remember the least, make the greatest impression on us. \n[21]I remember she wore diamonds... and she always dressed in fine clothing as if she was going out. Although, she never did and nobody would ever come to visit her. \n[22]...She taught me how to play the piano... \n[23]There were many changes going on, some you could see... some you couldn't. \n[24]Hair, had started growing, in all sorts of places... \n[25]These were hard times... people were doing anything they could to find work... \n[26]I was as happy as I could be... I would do anything... \n[27]And I actually was going to be paid for something I would have done for free. \n[28]His name was Captain Mike Clark... He'd been on boats since he was seven... \n[29]He took me to meet some friends... \n[30]It was a night to remember... \n[31]It sure made me understand the value of earning a living... the things it can buy you.. \n[32]I loved the weekends when she would come and spend the night with her grandmother. \n[33]I had never thought about life or death that way before... \n[34]And one fall day... a familiar visitor came knocking on our door... \n[35]She had taught me how to play the piano. \n[36]I had gone to a whore house, I'd had my first drink, I had said goodbye to one friend and buried another... In 1937, when I was coming to end of the 17th year of my life, I packed by bag. \n[37]I knew, life being what it was, I would probably never see them again... \n[38]And I went off to sea... \n[39]\"... With Captain Mike's crew on the \"Chelsea\"...\" \n[40]Captain Mike had contracted for three years with Moran Brothers Tug and Salvage... The old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine, and a new sea winch... We went around Florida and up the Atlantic seaboard... \n[41]We were a crew of seven now... Captain Mike and me... the Cookie... Prentiss Mayes from Wilmington, Delaware... \n[42]There was John Grimm, who fit his name... from Belvedere, South Dakota... \n[43]...and Pleasant Curtis who never said a word to anyone... except to himself... \n[44]Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea, the only ice-free ocean port in the Soviet Union... \n[45]We stayed at a small hotel with the grand name, \"The Winter Palace.\" \n[46]Everybody, no matter what differences they had, the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common... they were drunk every single night... \n[47]Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She was not beautiful. She was plain as paper... But she was as pretty as any picture to me... \n[48]Her husband was Walter Abbott...He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk... and he was a spy... \n[49]They were long days there... \n[50]And longer nights... \n[51]One particular night... when I was having trouble sleeping... \n[52]And she told me all the places she had been, and what she had seen... \n[53]And we talked until just before the dawn... \n[54]...And we went back to our rooms... to our separate lives... \n[55]A hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place... \n[56]Elizabeth and I would talk through the night until just before dawn... \n[57]It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me. It's something you never forget. \n[58]It took me a long time to go to sleep. \n[59]She was the first woman who ever loved me. \n[60]Until one night... \n[61]And so, I went to war. \n[62]It wasn't the war we expected. We would tow crippled ships... scraps of metal... \n[63]His name was Dennis Smith and he was a full blooded Cherokee... His family had been in America for over five hundred years. \n[64]I worked in the kitchen... \n[65]We were towing a British freighter, that had gone dead in the water, 800 miles to Halifax for repair... \n[66]He had given me all of his pay... he hadn't spent a dime of it... \n[67]The war found us. \n[68]There wasn't a sound... \n[69]736 men died that day... I said my goodbyes to the Cherokee, Dennis Smith, John Grimm who was right, he was going to die there... I sent Pleasant Curtis' wife his money... I said goodbye to the twin, Vic Brody... \n[70]I said goodbye to all the other men... who had dreams of their own... All the men who wanted to be plumbers or singers or insurance salesmen or doctors... or lawyers or Indian chiefs. \n[71]...I'd never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea before... \n[72]It's a funny thing about coming home. Smells the same. Looks the same.

I let her go... and I missed it... \n[78]I didn't need glasses anymore... \n[79]I told him about my life... about my time at war... and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort... \n[80]You can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went...You can swear, curse the fates, regret everything you ever did... but when it comes to the end... You have to let go... \n[81]I had a tailor sew onto his best coat -- a button for every year of his life....fifty-five of them... all different, pearl and silver, brass and wood... in case he lost one along the way... \n[82]I went to pay a visit to the button factory. \n[83]And I went to New York. \n[84]And I met her friends... \n[85]I'd find myself saying... Goodnight, Daisy. \n[86]If you want you could say I was looking for something... \n[87]Until one day... \n[88]Sometimes we are on a collision course and we just don't know it... Whether it's by accident or by design, there's not a thing we can do about it... \n[89]Daisy and her friend came out of the theater... \n[90]And her leg was crushed... \n[91]Her leg had been broken in five places.... and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk... \n[92]\"I stayed in Paris for awhile, just to look out for her...\" \n[93]I learned to sail on an old boat of my father's from the Lake House... \n[94]...Or maybe three... \n[95]She came back. \n[96]I asked her to come with me... \n[97]And you said... \n[98]And I said... \n[99]We buried her beside her beloved Mr. Weathers... \n[100]And we bought a house of our own... \n[101]We had no furniture to speak of... we would have picnics in the living room... \n[102]We slept on a mattress... \n[103]We vowed never to go to bed or wake up at the same time. We lived on that mattress... \n[104]We lived four blocks from a public pool... \n[105]And I think, right there and then, she realized none of us is perfect forever. \n[106]She opened a dance studio... \n[107]\"She was happier than I had ever seen her...\" \n[108]On a day like any other in the spring... \n[109]She gave birth to a five pound four ounce baby girl... \n[110]It was your first birthday.

Daisy, finished rehearsing, was taking a shower. \n[34]...While Daisy was showering; the taxi was waiting outside a Boutique for the woman to pick up a package... which hadn't been wrapped yet because the girl who was supposed to wrap it... had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot to... \n[35]When the package was done being wrapped... The woman, who was back in the cab... the taxi was blocked by a delivery truck... \n[36]All the while Daisy was getting dressed... \n[37]The Delivery truck pulled off and the taxi was able to go... \n[38]While Daisy, the first to be dressed, waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace... \n[39]And if only one thing had happened differently... if only the shoelace hadn't broken... \n[40]...Or the delivery truck had moved moments earlier... \n[41]...Or the package had been wrapped and ready... because the girl hadn't broken up with her boyfriend... \n[42]...Or the man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier. \n[43]...Or the taxi driver hadn't stopped for a cup of coffee... \n[44]...Or the woman had remembered her coat... \n[45]...And had gotten into an earlier cab... \n[46]Daisy and her friend would have crossed the street... \n[47]...and the taxi would have driven by them... \n[48]But life being what it is... a series of intersecting lives and incidents... Out of anyone's control... the taxi did not go by... and the driver momentarily was distracted... \n[49]And he didn't see Daisy crossing the street... \n[50]...and that taxi hit Daisy... \n[51]I can't lie, I did enjoy the company of a woman or two... \n[52]And in the spring of 1962... \n[53]Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a physical therapist... \n[54]Until she went out of sight... \n[55]\"I figured out one thing.

And today... I can't sew a stitch. \n[42]I said, our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty- four years. \n[43]You are my family.

She worked in your grandfather's kitchen...She was from Dublin... Her father, your maternal grandfather, was a chimney sweep... He died in the flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline came with her mother, two sisters, and four brothers in 1903 to live in New Orleans. \n[49]I would find reasons to go to the kitchen... just to look at her... \n[50]The happiest day of my life was April 25th, 1918 the day I married your mother. \n[51]I made a mistake. \n[52]Come and take your rightful place... with your family... with me... \n[53]We can catch up for all the lost time... \n[54]I'm planning on leaving everything I have to you... \n[55]Where are you going? \n[56]Thank you, Benjamin.
