They walk through a door and out of the Pit. \n[8]They don't do exfils. \n[9]Then why's he want me? \n[10]You can send in training wheels and wait at the border with Gatorade. Attention turns to Mendez. O'Donnell shifts. Engell, not happy. \n[11]It's 300 miles to the Turkish crossings. They'd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump. \n[12]If these people can read OR add, any minute they're gonna figure out they're six short of a full deck. It's winter.

Bates, meanwhile, removing a binder from his accordion folder: in the binder, a photograph of an emaciated kid in Namibia. \n[15]What do you see in the picture, sir? A beat. Pender dsn't like this, but he'll play. \n[16]What's on the ground? \n[17]So what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty? Pender shifts. \n[18]Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room. Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony. \n[19]Buddy-man. \n[20]You do homework tonight? \n[21]What was it? But Tony can hear a television soundtrack with ominous ARGO - Final 28. \n[22]What do I hear? \n[23]What channel? \n[24]Catch me up. Tony listens, staring ahead at the TV . A desert used to speak about. \n[25]Hi. Sorry. Hi. \n[26]They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science fiction movie -- A shift in the room. \n[27]Star Wars, Star Trek. They need an exotic place to shoot. We put it out -- the Canadian producers put it out -- that they're looking at Turkey, Egypt, whatever. Then we go to the consulate and say we wanna look at Iran. I fly in there and we fly out together as a film crew. Done. \n[28]This is more plausible than foreigners who want to go to school in Iran -- \n[29]I've got a contact in L.A. \n[30]John Chambers. He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy, ds contracting work for us on the side. If I go see him, he'll set us up. A couple days to make it look real. Mendez and O'Donnell turn their eyes on Pender, who is the decision-maker here. \n[31]Remind me who you are again? \n[32]What are you shooting? \n[33]Any good? \n[34]Who's the target audience? \n[35]It's an exfil. \n[36]Worst place you can think of. \n[37]Six got away. They're hiding in the city. I'm going over to get them. \n[38]I need you to help me make a fake movie. \n[39]I need to set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie. \n[40]No. \n[41]That's right. \n[42]No. \n[43]Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day? \n[44]I'm the producer. \n[45]... and past a hundred Komiteh at the airport. \n[46]That's too soon. \n[47]\u0098Fade in on starship landing. An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. Women gather, offering ecstatic libations to the sky gods.' \u0098ARGO. A science-fantasy adventure.' Mendez throws down the script. \n[48]It's a space movie in the Middle East. Ds it matter? Chambers looks at the BULLSEYE logo on the cover page.

He's gotta... stay where he is. \n[59]\u0098War' sounds like Star Wars. Let's use a different word. Mendez closes the door to his private office. \n[60]I need another week. \n[61]We've got a script.

ARGO - Final 55. \n[71]You can forget about that time- share in Ocean City, Jack. \n[72]Yes, sir. \n[73]Yes, sir. \n[74]-- two, we think everybody knows Hollywood people. And everybody thinks they would shoot during Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing if it'd sell tickets. There are only bad options. It's about finding the best one. \n[75]Barely claim me as it is. \n[76]Just Christine. They don't need to look at one another. A shared understanding. \n[77]Guess I should have brought some books to read in prison. \n[78]We've got a green light. Chambers gives Siegel a thumbs-up. \n[79]Keep the office running till you hear otherwise. \n[80]Business. Film production. The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport. \n[81]My boss waited until I was here to send the telex. If he had a thought in his head, it would die of loneliness. Pointed look from Mendez. The universal condition of boss hatred almost always works for him, and it ds now. Consul nods. Stamps the passport. KINGDOM OF IRAN -- He crosses out KINGDOM and writes by hand: ISLAMIC REPUBLIC \n[82]Can't be right all the time. \n[83]When'd you get back? \n[84]Were you metal detecting? \n[85]But you kept busy. \n[86]So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me. \n[87]How's June? \n[88]I'm sorry. \n[89]Good. Yeah. \n[90]Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada. \n[91]The bazaar, maybe the palace. \n[92]Mr. Ambassador. \n[93]You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car. \n[94]I'll take care of that. \n[95]A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it. \n[96]The chances are good. \n[97]There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons. \n[98]That's why I'm here. I'll be with you. This is what I do. \n[99]This would be a first. \n[100]Harkins. \n[101]No. \n[102]If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a \n[103]I don't know. \n[104]Your cover identities were created specifically for each one of you. \n[105]What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope. A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it. \n[106]When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed. \n[107]\u0098The Minister of Culture and Guidance has approved your location scout.' \n[108]\u0098He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.' \n[109]Or maybe they're cooperating. \n[110]Seven Canadians, Jack. \n[111]They're getting there. \n[112]I don't have a choice. We say no, they come to the residence and pull everyone out at gunpoint. How do you think the covers hold up with their fingernails pulled out? \n[113]What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up -- \n[114]I'm asking you to trust me. \n[115]This one, how much? One day, how much? \n[116]I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow. \n[117]My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy. \n[118]Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows. \n[119]Let's make a movie. \n[120]Mike? \n[121]If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again. \n[122]She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi. \n[123]Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside. \n[124]Tomorrow they'll be ready. We start to hear the sound of the evening's call to prayer, amplified over a megaphone, in the distance. \n[125]Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests. \n[126]Where were you born? \n[127]Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T. \n[128]If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that. \n[129]Last three Canadian prime minsters. \n[130]Good.  Your job on the film. \n[131]Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on? \n[132]Who paid for the movie? \n[133]What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper. \n[134]He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated -- \n[135]They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 so well that you don't flinch. \n[136]My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9 back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this. \n[137]Let's go again. \n[138]What is it? \n[139]I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out. \n[140]They will be taken. Probably not \n[141]We're responsible for those people. \n[142]I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest. \n[143]So you know. \n[144]Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible. I'm taking them through. And before Jack can answer, Tony hangs up. Stands. A duffel bag over his shoulder, Tony turns out the light in the hotel room. Gs. \n[145]Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand. \n[146]The first checkpoint is just to look at your passport. \n[147]Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine. \n[148]The second checkpoint -- \n[149]The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago. \n[150]These guys are bureaucrats left over from the shah. They can't be bothered to second-guess you. \n[151]Third checkpoint is the trap. \n[152]It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe. \n[153]They know how many \u0098T's are in Toronto. \n[154]You can call our office. Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin Harkins. A 213  phone number. \n[155]\n[156]Wha'd you say to her? \n[157]He wants to fire me himself. \n[158]If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break. \n[159]They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back? \n[160]I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car. \n[161]A great American what? \n[162]Hi. ", "O'DONNELL": "\n[1]The six of them went out a back exit. Brits turned them away, Kiwis turned them away. The Canadians took them in. They've been there since. O'Donnell hands Mendez pages with STAFF PHOTOGRAPHS of SIX PEOPLE -- the escaped embassy employees -- as he continues to toss stuff into his folder. \n[2]Traffic calls them The Houseguests. Haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house since it happened. \n[3]Just a matter of time. We've got Revolutionary Guards going door-to- door like Jehovah's Witnesses, looking for escapees. They're out for blood, Tony. Half of them think Khomeini's been too lenient with the ones in the embassy. Walking out of his office, Mendez following. \n[4]Carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids. He wants the six of them out. \n[5]Just the families. Meanwhile, some genius in the embassy was keeping a mug book of everybody who worked there. \n[6]We think it got shredded before they got in, but the fuckers have sweat-shop kids in there re- assembling the shreds. \n[7]They're gonna make an example of the ones who escaped. Standing- room-only for beheadings in the square. \n[8]State's coordinating in-house. \n[9]They do now. They want to run it by us, strictly as consultants. Off his look. \n[10]Engell's saying it's lose-lose. These people die, they die badly. Publicly. \u0098State wants the blame, he'll give it to them. \n[11]So he can tell State he ran it by his best exfil guy. They stop in front of a conference room. Jack looks at him. \n[12]Tony. This isn't the kind of meeting where you talk. \n[13]Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot of the shah's people out after the fall. \n[14]Is he coming? Engell nods for the door to be shut. \n[15]Have a seat, Tony. He dsn't. There's an energy in him we haven't seen before. \n[16]We want you to go to L.A. If you can make the movie thing credible, we'll take it to the Director. (a beat; a cigarette \n[17]The Canadians are done. Say they're bearing too much risk. \n[18]Foreign Secretary cornered Vance in Brussels and told him she's serving eviction papers. The Cardinal wants all cover options on his desk Friday morning. \n[19]Engell's prepping the Bikes Option and the Teachers Option. You've got 72 hours to make yours better... \n[20]They caught the shah's chief of security trying to get on a plane to Paris. \n[21]\u0098Since the incident, the number of guards at the airport has doubled. Thorough background examinations should be expected.' \n[22]You don't have it. \n[23]He did it \u0098cause he did it. \n[24]He saw a covert intelligence officer saying \u0098cheese' with R2- D2. They're going with the teachers. \n[25]Well then it's on Engell. It's done, Tony. Wash your hands. He hangs up. Mendez, looking out the hotel window at \n[26]What did you do to get the meeting? \n[27]Brace yourself. It's like talking to those two old fucks on \u0098The Muppets.' Vance and Turner enter the room without recognizing them. Mendez and O'Donnell stand up. \n[28]One, there are no foreign teachers in Iran anymore -- \n[29]This is the best bad idea we have, sir. By far. Vance and Turner exchange looks. \n[30]I'm required to remind you that if you're detained, the agency will not claim you. \n[31]Your \u0098In Case Of's' good? \n[32]Nah. They'll kill you long before prison. Tony gets out of the car, pulls his bags from the back seat, and slams the door. Headed into the airport. \n[33]He got to the embassy. O'Donnell closes the door. Pender, wearing an undone tuxedo, as if he's just been pulled from a formal event. They stay standing. \n[34]I can't tell you more than that \u0098cause I don't know any more. \n[35]Mother of God. \n[36]They called your bluff. \n[37]N.E. says absolutely not. Seven Americans walking the bazaar, you're asking for a riot, it's the \n[38]Never give them multiple shots at a cover. Are they even ready? \n[39]Terrific. There's no prize for \u0098Most Improved.' \n[40]Go to black on green. Jack's calling him here, so he knows something's wrong. \n[41]Go to black on green. Mendez turns knobs on the satellite phone. \n[42]It all just changed. They called the game. You've got to come back. ON Mendez, not believing what he's hearing. \n[43]Joint Chiefs are planning a military rescue of the hostages in a month. Delta Force started training to storm the grounds. So if the six of them get brought down there, they won't be held for long. \n[44]It's over, Tony. \n[45]LISTEN TO ME. The thinking's changed. Six Americans get pulled out of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed, it's another world outrage. Six Americans get caught playing movie make-believe with the CIA at the airport and executed, it's a national embarrassment. They're calling the operation. \n[46]What we are is required to follow orders. I'm sorry. Mendez hangs up. O'Donnell sits listening to the dial tone for a moment, then puts the phone on the receiver. \n[47]Yeah. \n[48]We need to confirm those seven tickets out of Tehran on \n[49]I'm saying it's back on! \n[50]What the fuck ds that mean? \n[51]Where's Engell? \n[52]Pull him out.  \n[53]It is going. \n[54]Am I goddamn close? \n[55]I'm not leaving him at the airport with six people and his dick in his hand. Tell the Director to call the White House. DO YOUR \n[56]Where's the Director? \n[57]Find White House Chief of Staff. \n[58]We're a fucking SPY AGENCY! FIND \n[59]Where are his kids? \n[60]Where do his kids go to school? \n[61]Yes, it's Mr. Murphy calling from Pace Academy for Mr. Jordan... I'm afraid it IS an emergency... \n[62]Jack O'Donnell from C.I. \n[63]Tehran Houseguest operation is ready NOW. We don't have the President's go-ahead. They are going to be captured. Jordan stands up with the phone. \n[64]Copy D.S.! Confirm the tickets! \n[65]Get the L.A. office -- tell them to be ready in case they call. \n[66]They should have boarded already. \n[67]Wait. \n[68]Involved in what? We're as surprised as anybody. Thank you, Canada. Jack raises a glass of Scotch and takes a drink. \n[69]And I left my autograph book at home. His Eminence called me. He \n[70]He wants to give you the Intelligence Star. You're getting the highest award of merit of the Clandestine Services of these United States. Ceremony's two weeks from today. Mendez stops walking. A beat. \n[71]The op was classified so the ceremony's classified. He can't know about it. Nobody can know about it. \n[72]If we wanted applause, we would have joined the circus. \n[73]\n[74]He didn't say. ", "SIEGEL": "\n[1]Yeah, come in. \n[2]I only got a couple minutes. I'm getting a lifetime achievement award tonight. \n[3]Aaah, I'd rather stay home and count the wrinkles on my dog's balls. These fuckin' things are like getting measured for your coffin. \u0098He don't look so good. Let's give him an honorary award.' \n[4]A little experiment. You be me hearing you. The TV we're watching sits in a room with a couple of Golden Globes and pictures of a younger Lester. \n[5]Six people in the middle of a city of, what, four million -- ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd (in one of the most widely-played clips of the hostage crisis) makes an ax- falling gesture with her arm repeatedly. \n[6]-- who chant \u0098Death to America' all the livelong day. You wanna set up a picture in a week. Lie to a whole town of people who lie for a living. Have Double-O-Seven here sneak into a country that wants CIA blood with their breakfast cereal. Duck Iranian intelligence. Then walk the Brady Bunch out of the most watched city in the world... \n[7]Look, I wanna help you but... In the Army, we did suicide missions that had better odds. So lemme hit it again for the cheap seats: \n[8]They're getting the ratings, I'll give \u0098em that -- Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of him. He takes a beat. \n[9]We're gonna need a script. A beat of silence. A LOOK from Siegel to Chambers. \n[10]Nobody makes Westerns anymore. \n[11]If it's got horses in the title, it's a Western. \n[12]If I'm doing a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit. \n[13]It's in turnaround. It's dog shit. \n[14]You're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA. \n[15]He's only a prick if you catch him on the wrong day. \n[16]It's always the wrong day. \n[17]He's the money. \n[18]-- Till I read the Argo. Look, how \u0098bout we say fifteen thou and close on this? \n[19]Naah, bullshit me, Max. \n[20]Thank you. Very respectful. \n[21]What can I say? Congratulations.  He's got me. A beat. Mendez ready to go -- \n[22]But see -- it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire -- which was gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget \u0098cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize. \n[23]They may be cannibals swallowing each other up but they want health and dental, so the movie's kaput -- which means that MGM deal ain't gonna happen and your script ain't worth the buffalo-shit on a nickel. So. Lester takes some documents out of a folder. \n[24]The way this looks to me -- through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them. \n[25]I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes. Taco? \n[26]Two daughters. \n[27]I talk to them once a year, maybe. \n[28]I was a terrible father. The bullshit business is like coal mining. You can't wash it off before you kiss your wife and kids... You? \n[29]You're divorced? \n[30]Kids need the mother. \n[31]-- press event and reading... No, I promised Variety exclusive on that one... Mendez is making a list with a PUBLICIST. \n[32]I gotta get back to you, Phil. I can't get my own mother a ticket. I had to tell her it was cancelled. \n[33]You know what gets more suckers than a sign that says \u0098Brooklyn Bridge For Sale'? \u0098Brooklyn Bridge: Approved Buyers Only.'  Philip? You there? Chambers leads us into the main room, leading Tony to a table where JACK KIRBY, 62, comics artist, fusses with large COMIC PANELS of ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS spread over a table. Kirby starts to distribute storyboards. Some hold on to them and an ASSISTANT begins putting them up on the board. Mendez looks at them. Impressed. He picks up a drawing of some futuristic-looking vehicles. \n[34]You're gorgeous. You're in the reading? \n[35]Keep that fucking space witch away from me. \n[36]I was married to her. Mendez, now talking to RODD, from VARIETY. \n[37]The Argo, it's the, y'know, the \n[38]-- the spaceship, it flies around space, alllll over space -- \n[39]No. \n[40]It means Argo fuck yourself. \n[41]I made thirty pictures. Half of them the pricks upstairs tried to shut me down. Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag. \n[42]My ass is staying right here and running a movie company. Mendez stops zipping as Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and three shot glasses from a drawer. \n[43]Ey. The first shot of the picture. Lester gives glasses to each of them. Chambers holds up his glass. \n[44]There's always another prick one floor higher up. \n[45]Bad news, bad news, even when it's good news it's bad news. Christ. (a phone starts \n[46]\u0098Til the dawn's early light. \n[47]You wouldn't be me for long. I'm 80. Producer walks away and Lester looks into the \u0098Argo' office as he squeezes the ball. FROM INSIDE THE OFFICE -- In the foreground, we see what Lester is looking at: a phone. Stubbornly silent. \n[48]They can wait. Let's go get a drink. \n[49]I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna be in the movie. Call my agent. \n[50]\n[51]It's history, is what it is. \u0098History plays out first as farce, then as tragedy.' \n[52]Who said it? \n[53]Groucho? \n[54]She said, \u0098Why couldn't we pull off something like that?' You know what I said to her? \n[55]I said, \u0098Argo fuck yourself.' ", "CHAMBERS": "\n[1]If he could act he wouldn't be playing the Minotaur. He smiles and waves at the Minotaur and begins to work on his prosthetic with a brush and solvent. \n[2]Who is it? \n[3]Hey, Tony. \n[4]A monster movie. \n[5]The target audience will hate it. \n[6]People with eyes.
