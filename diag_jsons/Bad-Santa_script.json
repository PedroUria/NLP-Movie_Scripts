I never got any B's, \n[197]Oh... \n[198]Jesus Fucking Christ, Kid! Why do talk about yourself like that? What the fuck is that about?! What's with you anyway? I ain't Fucking Santa Claus! Look at me, I am living fucking proof that there ain't no Santa Claus! \n[199]Oh... \n[200]Look, kicking the shit out of those kids, that's as generous as I can get. \n[201]\n[202]You fuckin' spic! \n[203]I pissed my pants! \n[204]'Tendo it is. \n[205]...Everything I touch turns to shit and dies. \n[206]Barbie it is... \n[207]...That it? \n[208]Let's do it. \n[209]Up your ass. \n[210]Oh shit... \n[211]It's a Kitnerboy Redoubt. \n[212]...You know Andy Pitts? \n[213]No, Andy Lapitski. Andy Pizzarelli is Andy Blue Balls. \n[214]Andy Lapitski can get into anything. Anything. They say he's been in Margaret Thatcher's pussy. \n[215]In the joint he told me that the Kitnerboy... \n[216]...cannot be cracked. \n[217]No... I'm saying it's gonna take me a minute. \n[218]Piece of cake. \n[219]...I'll be right back. I gotta grab one thing. \n[220]Shit... which did he say? \n[221]Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this. \n[222]Wuddya mean, fucking guy's greedier than... \n[223]...greedier than fuck. \n[224]Dead, huh... \n[225]...I didn't even know he was sick. \n[226]Uh-huh. \n[227]Sure.

I hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much I guess. \n[237]...Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. I am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways... \n[238]...Thank you for giving that letter to the cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. And now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever. \n[239]...As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi. \n[240]...So I'll be staying in Phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. They're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so I'll see you when I come over to fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no shit from nobody. Least of all yourself. Anyways... see ya soon... \n[241]...Santa. ", "MARCUS": "\n[1]Jesus. \n[2]How's it goin'? \n[3]I'm goin' downstairs...

I was against the Clinton impeachment. What a man does with his penis -- Oval Office, Women's Big &amp; Tall -- it's not for the American people to say. \n[16]But when you're dealing with children, a tender sensibility, a position of trust -- then perhaps, someone who has screaming orgasms with large women -- \n[17]Though I can't fire him for that. \n[18]Sizisra. They'd say. \n[19]Not true. I am no siziat.
