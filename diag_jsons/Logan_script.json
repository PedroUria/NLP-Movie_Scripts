Plating flakes off, you know... \n[4]It's a lease, you know, and no one wants to pay to ride in a-- \n[5]Fuck. \n[6]Guys... seriously... You don't wanna do this. \n[7]\n[8]Back to work, old man. \n[9]They're locked, ma'am. \n[10]Don't we all. \n[11]Who the fuck are you? \n[12]Get out. Now. \n[13]I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out. \n[14]What do you want? \n[15]Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? \n[16]Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but I am telling you I have 45 cash now. Just bring it to port in Baja. \n[17]They're all bad days. \n[18]I'm working on it. \n[19]He's not talking with anybody. \n[20]Please stop. \n[21]That's what these are for. \n[22]No. \n[23]You know who I am. \n[24]We could both use some sleep. \n[25]Charles, you're making this-- \n[26]You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures, the pills keep them from happening. \n[27]How `bout you blow on them to make them safe. \n[28]So you know who I am now. \n[29]Take the pills. \n[30]A what? \n[31]Too bad you're not in that business anymore. \n[32]The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time. \n[33]There are no new mutants. Hasn't been a new one born in twenty-five years. Not anywhere. \n[34]You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake. \n[35]I'm not in the mood for bedtime-- \n[36]They're gone now. \n[37]It's for your own good. \n[38]What things. \n[39]It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands. \n[40]It wasn't even a minute. \n[41]That money's to get us out of here. \n[42]I don't need this right now. \n[43]Oh, Jesus. \n[44]Not available. Call a cab. \n[45]I don't want to know your name! \n[46]Anyone can do that job. \n[47]How'd you find me? Huh?! `Cause you are fucking up my life, lady. The people after you are on my ass now. \n[48]Sightings. \n[49]And by people, you mean fat fucktards living in their parents' basements playing with dolls? \n[50]Get your fat ass back in your office. You'll get your money. \n[51]When did that happen? \n[52]Where did you get this? \n[53]Does to me. \n[54]That's your daughter? \n[55]I can't leave right now. \n[56]Or what? \n[57]I can get you there Friday. But I need to go home first, take care of some things. \n[58]I'll be back in a few hours. Keep this locked. And tell your mommy I know she's lying. \n[59]I got a job that's gonna pay enough to change things. But I have to go away. For a week. \n[60]Charles. Listen. I gotta go for a few days. I got a long ride for some good money. When I get back, we're getting out of here, okay. Gonna drive down to Yelapa and get ourselves a boat. Live on the ocean. \n[61]Yeah. I'll be safe. \n[62]Ready to go? \n[63]...Fuck. \n[64]The job was wrong to begin with. \n[65]Aren't you supposed to see shit coming? \n[66]Go inside. Keep Charles quiet. Go. Inside. \n[67]You need to turn around, asshole. This is private property. \n[68]He's been dead for a year. \n[69]What girl. \n[70]There's no girl here. \n[71]I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman. \n[72]No. Did you? \n[73]I don't like guns. \n[74]Hey! \n[75]Worse. \n[76]Not for long. Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures. \n[77]Text me where you are and we'll pick you up. \n[78]You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into. \n[79]What. \n[80]So she talks. \n[81]Take them-- Now. We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there. Understand? \n[82]She's not a mutant. \n[83]What's her gift, eating? Pipe throwing? \n[84]We gotta go. \n[85]--it's not a train. We gotta go! \n[86]Don't move! \n[87]She's not our problem. \n[88]I'm thinking. \n[89]Please be quiet. \n[90]Where's Caliban? \n[91]I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?! \n[92]You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy? \n[93]As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. \n[94]Hold on! \n[95]Who the fuck are you? \n[96]No. I don't. \n[97]Battery's dead. We need a plug. \n[98]Charles. \n[99]What is she? \n[100]Not just mine. \n[101]I don't wanna hear it. I don't want to talk about it anymore. \n[102]Stop. \n[103]Last ride. Then we're leaving. \n[104]You're welcome. \n[105]Well, you're not doing it! \n[106]Not okay. \n[107]Sorry. \n[108]We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple hours sleep, clean up, get new clothes, ditch the limo, get a new ride and get the fuck out. \n[109]Keep it out front. \n[110]Please wait till we're in the room. \n[111]Sorry. Going up. \n[112]...For fuck's sake. \n[113]You read this in your spare time? \n[114]You do know this is bullshit, right? A quarter of it happened. And none like this. In the real world, people die and no self promoting asshole in a leotard can stop it. This is just ice cream for \n[115]Right. Fine. \n[116]Take two more in an hour. \n[117]...Fuck. \n[118]Knock yourselves out. \n[119]...yeah. Here's the thing. I'll give you twelve as is-- if you can forget the paperwork. \n[120]How long is that gonna take? \n[121]Jesus Christ... \n[122]`you gotta be fuckin' kidding me. \n[123]I'll take the bottle. \n[124]I don't know. \n[125]Come on, come on! \n[126]We have to go. \n[127]Hey! Now! \n[128]This way! \n[129]Knock it off. \n[130]I said knock it off. \n[131]How long has it been since you took your meds? Charles. How long? \n[132]You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino-- \n[133]You didn't do anything. You freaked out and had a fucking seizure. \n[134]Easier? There's nothing easy about you. \n[135]Yeah, I know, Pop, I'm such a giant \n[136]What are we doing?! \n[137]Yes. It means nothing to me. Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all this Eden shit up from fucking comic books. \n[138]Give those to him. Take out two and give them to him. \n[139]Now. For fuck's sake. Take the pills. Now. \n[140]Take them. Give him the pills. \n[141]\n[142]Cop. Fuck. \n[143]She. I might have been speeding. \n[144]If it wasn't, there'd be a lot more than her behind us. I need you to please try and not kill this lady. Okay? \n[145]Was I going a mite fast, officer? \n[146]I just bought it, but I-- here-- \n[147]Seventy? Ish? \n[148]Shit. I didn't think this thing could make that. \n[149]Yes, ma'am. \n[150]She doesn't speak. \n[151]Laura. \n[152]\n[153]\n[154]What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words? \n[155]You mean, better than me. \n[156]Shit. Oh well.   \n[157]We have to keep moving. Someone will come along.  \n[158]Can I give you a hand?  \n[159]James. Howlett.    \n[160]Yeah. That's Laura. And that's my... dad. Chuck. \n[161]North. \n[162]No, thank you, we really can't-- Laura, get back here. \n[163]Oregon. \n[164]Oh. I uh, I-- \n[165]Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for dinner. But we have a long drive ahead of us. \n[166]We'll find a motel. \n[167]Kathryn. That's very nice of you, but we really should hit the-- \n[168]Let's go wash up, Pop. \n[169]That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving. \n[170]And then what. We stay the night and then what? \n[171]What is it? \n[172]Who's \"they?\" \n[173]I'll go. \n[174]Just let me get my dad... settled. \n[175]There's a TV in here. \n[176]Okay... Get some rest. \n[177]Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book. \n[178]You just need to understand-- it's not real. \n[179]So today, out on the highway-- \n[180]So why do people eat it? \n[181]Mine still are. \n[182]Since... well.. the beginning. \n[183]You're a lucky man. \n[184]That should hold it. \n[185]I'm nobody. Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck and play Okie dickhead somewhere else. \n[186]I hear that a lot. \n[187]More than I'd like. \n[188]Three. \n[189]You all know the drill. Go. \n[190]Some. \n[191]No, but I'll take a drink if you got one. \n[192]Maybe I got something in the truck. \n[193]Only on days that end in \"Y.\" \n[194]You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need-- \n[195]--What? \n[196]Hold still! Stop it! Stop! \n[197]Well. It's got water and... it's... \n[198]--its got water and it's -- \n[199]...Fuck this... \n[200]...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my-- \n[201]--I'm alright. I'm fine. \n[202]...I know what it is. \n[203]--Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way. \n[204]Let's go. \n[205]You can't just take shit, you know. \n[206]Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you. \n[207]...You can talk? \n[208]You can talk. \n[209]What the fuck?! Why haven't you-- What's all this bullshit been for the last two thousand miles of-- \n[210]\n[211]Who is that? \n[212]Okay. Look. This place. Your mom... she read too many... stories. \n[213]Yeah, I know... I saw it... \n[214]Right. This place does not exist. No exist-o. It's fictional. Eden does not exist. \n[215]No. I am saying that place is imaginary. It's a fantasy. See that \n[216]Yes, I know. It's a long way. \n[217]Okay. First-- ow. Second, Look at me. I'm fucked up. That's two days driving from here. \n[218]Stop saying those names-- \n[219]Do. Not. Hit. Me. \n[220]--And stop saying those-- \n[221]Okay-- ENOUGH. Enough. \n[222]No. Absolutely not. \n[223]Quit looking at me. \n[224]No comprende. \n[225]What else did he tell you? \n[226]Hey. \n[227]Where am I? \n[228]Where did you get this?! \n[229]It makes you crazy is what it does. It'll kill you. \n[230]Where's Laura. \n[231]...No. \n[232]Do you have nightmares? \n[233]Mine are different. \n[234]I hurt people. \n[235]You know what it is. \n[236]It's made of Adamantium. Same thing they put inside us. That's why it can kill us. Probably killing me now. Anyway, I got that a long time ago. Kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to-- Actually, I was thinking about shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. \n[237]You're gonna have to learn how to live with that. \n[238]All the same. \n[239]What. \n[240]Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth was real. He was in a program with me. Like what they did to you. \n[241]Yes. \n[242]Kid, I don't know what I'm doing. \n[243]Not funny. Not funny at all. \n[244]Hey, pal, how long have I been out? \n[245]Hey. \n[246]How long have I been in that bed? \n[247]You've been sitting here two days? You can't do that. You can't just stay here forever. \n[248]Well, if you keep waiting those assholes will find you. And kill you all. You need to get out. \n[249]To Canada? \n[250]Okay. Good. \n[251]Keep it. For your supplies or whatever. \n[252]Yeah. Well. Look. I don't need this. You do. For supplies. Buy her some cereal. \n[253]They seem nice. Your friends. Kinda remind me-- \n[254]What's going on with you? \n[255]Hey. I asked you a question. What are you pissed about? You're with your friends. You made it. \n[256]Nearest bar, for starters. \n[257]What-- you thought I was coming along? \n[258]That was never the deal. I got you this far, that's all I signed up for. I gave back the money -- \n[259]Hey, I never asked for this. \n[260]Look, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I'm not... whatever it is you think I am. \n[261]You don't need me. You've got Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby, blah blah whoever. Hey. It's better this way. I suck at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. \n[262]Laura! Now! \n[263]Go to your friends, Laura. \n[264]...You'll know when. \n[265]He's the asshole who put this poison in me. \n[266]I think I might have killed him. \n[267]Growing mutants of your own. \n[268]Yeah. Dangerous. \n[269]Laura... \n[270]Go, go GO! Run! \n[271]...Take your friends and run. Go. Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll just keep coming and coming. ...Don't be what they made you. \n[272]...it's okay... \n[273]So this is what it feels like. ", "CHARLES": "\n[1]Friends, I have Good News today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't live up to his rules. God knows you can't. That's OK! We're imperfect! \n[2]Make way, sir. \n[3]I said make way. \n[4]The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell. Get it with chicken, get it with steak. But with cheese baked right in the shell it's the next big-- Who are you? \n[5]The man who puts me to sleep. \n[6]What are you fucking doing to me!? \n[7]How long have I been here? \n[8]What are these? \n[9]Fuck off, Logan. \n[10]I always know who you are. Sometimes I just don't recognize you. \n[11]...you leave me alone with that fucking Albino... he won't listen to me. I know a damn speciation when I see one. \n[12]A speciation. A new mutant. A young one. There are forces trying to kill them! They need help! \n[13]They want your help, not mine. Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you. At the Statue of Liberty. \n[14]Impossible. \n[15]What a disappointment you are. \n[16]When I found you, you were pursuing a career as a \"cage fighter\". \n[17]A warm capper to life as an assassin, hooked on barbiturates. You were an animal, but we took you in. I gave you a family. \n[18]What did you do? \n[19]Answer me! Why are we here? \n[20]No one should have to live this way! Drugged! In a fucking tank! \n[21]No. NO it's NOT! You're waiting for me to die! \n[22]Drink new Hypno Plus! Fortified with seven nutrients and Extacine 5, for energy and vitality! \n[23]I like those. They make you look younger. \n[24]And... you'll be safe there? From the people after you? \n[25]Logan. \n[26]Logan. Caliban. This is Laura. \n[27]We've been waiting for you. \n[28]This way, child. Come here, Laura. \n[29]You did what you could, Laura. Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful. \n[30]Logan. \n[31]That wasn't her mother you met. \n[32]We're communicating. \n[33]She's the mutant I told you about. The one we have to help. \n[34]Yes, she is. \n[35]It's alright, Laura. It's only a train. A choo choo. \n[36]It's alright. It's just another-- \n[37]Don't be afraid, child. He'll come back for you! \n[38]...bloody hell. \n[39]My God... \n[40]Logan! \n[41]Logan! You have to go back for her! \n[42]I know what you just did. \n[43]\n[44]Logan... \n[45]The child, Logan. We mustn't forget Laura. ...Logan... \n[46]Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually... \n[47]...My Lord. \n[48]...As I said, Logan, she's a mutant... Like you. Very much like you, in fact. \n[49]Where are we going? \n[50]Laura! \n[51]You know who she is, Logan. \n[52]Does she remind you of anybody? \n[53]Is there more? Play it. \n[54]How far is it? To North Dakota. \n[55]You took that woman's money. You told her you would take the child there. \n[56]She's your daughter, Logan. Alkali had your genetic code. \n[57]Logan... \n[58]Logan. \n[59]I have to pee. \n[60]Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself! \n[61]...Is this where we're hiding out? \n[62]This film is a classic, Laura. Almost a hundred years old now. I first saw it at the Esoldo in Dewsbury when I was your age. \n[63]--Logan. \n[64]I think Laura well understands life's impermanence. \n[65]Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride? \n[66]Good-bye, Logan. \n[67]I'm so sorry. Oh God... \n[68]She's a child, Logan. In point of fact she's-- \n[69]...I don't know. Two days. \n[70]I did what I had to do to stop those men from taking Laura. \n[71]I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like some lunatic. So much easier on you. \n[72]Yes, Yes please, be like the rest of the world and blame someone else for your boring shit. \n[73]Self loathing. Anger. Disdain. Cowardice. Oh yes. Your peaks and your valleys. Mostly valleys-- it's all so Goddamn boring. \n[74]You honestly derive no sense of purpose from what we're doing? \n[75]There is a young mutant. Sitting in our car. \n[76]And where we are taking her, there are more of them. Does that mean nothing to you? \n[77]What are you talking about? \n[78]What do you mean-- \n[79]Logan. \n[80]\n[81]Happy? \n[82]What does he want? \n[83]Are you sure that's all it is? \n[84]My son has a bit of a lead foot. I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as beautiful a day from now. \n[85]Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine. \n[86]She can learn to be better. \n[87]Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender. In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival. \n[88]We have to help them.  \n[89]Someone has come along.  \n[90]That would be lovely. \n[91]Slow down, child. \n[92]South Dakota. \n[93]Oregon, then South Dakota. \n[94]Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country. Meet the people who live in it. \n[95]And I bet you will. \n[96]Kathryn, that was easily the best meatloaf I've ever had. \n[97]He was. She passed. \n[98]He killed her. \n[99]We could leave first thing in the morning. Crack of dawn as it were. \n[100]--two days on the road with one meal and hardly any sleep. She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety. \n[101]I'm not a box of avocados. \n[102]We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker. \n[103]My son can go with you. \n[104]I'm fine. \n[105]You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it. You still have time. \n[106]It is for Laura. \n[107]...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour. \n[108]...This was, without a doubt, the most splendid night I've had in a long time. ...but then... \n[109]...I don't deserve it, do I? ...I did something... unspeakable. \n[110]I remembered what happened in Westchester. This was not the first time I've hurt people. Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. We just kept running from it. I'm done running. \n[111]I think I finally understand you, Logan... ...the burden you carry... \n[112]Logan... \n[113]...our boat... ...our Eden... ", "PIERCE": "\n[1]As I live and breathe. The Wolverine. And he's a junkie now. \n[2]Y'know, you got some buckshot in your door. I heard you were in Phoenix. Food's better there by the way. But then, last night, some friends in Texas H-P called, told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54. Not unusual, except one was missing a hand. Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic. So, they're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger or Freddy Krueger... but neither of those can drive, one being fictional the other extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a `24 Gauntlet-- \n[3]Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela? See, I'm not looking for you, mutey. Not really. I'm looking for someone who's looking for you. \n[4]She took something of mine. Something for which I am responsible. When I wasn't looking. Mexican lady. Long hair, long legs, Long gone. Has her sights on you. No bells? \n[5]I know what you're hiding, amigo. Cue ball south of the border? \n[6]A little ...cooperation. \n[7]If she does find you. \n[8]Yes, it is. In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai. \n[9]Where you keeping the old man? In there? Or there. I'd like to meet him. I'm told HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now. `Damned shame, what happened back east. \n[10]I need the girl. \n[11]One that goes with that ball you're holding. That's special rubber, you know. Coated with something called J-Tek. Gets in through the skin. Very calming. Like Magnesium but without the side effects. You feel calmer? \n[12]I know you went to the motel. \n[13]\"The woman\". Such as she was. So you saw Gabriela but you didn't call me? That hurts. Say, you didn't shoot the poor thing, did you? \n[14]I asked you first. \n[15]Of course. I wish you had called me, Logan. Like I asked. \n[16]See. You're not the only one who's \n[17]You're fucked now, mutey. \n[18]Ah, Charles Xavier. The most wanted octogenarian in North America-- \n[19]How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly. \n[20]I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me. \n[21]Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart. \n[22]That-a-girl. \n[23]...Laura. \n[24]Laura. Stay where you are. You want to see your friends, right? \n[25]Commander, stop! \n[26]Laura! NO! NO!! \n[27]Leave nothing behind fellas. We were not here! \n[28]Bring me the tracker. \n[29]Wakey wakey. \n[30]You know, I read about you when I was a kid. You tracked that crazy gilled mutey fishy motherfuck, what was his name, Wave? Tracked him halfway `cross the Atlantic they said. And you was underwater. Inside a sub. And you found him anyway. Shit. That's a gift. That's trackin'! \n[31]'I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team, for the good guys. You were helping round up all the old mutes. \n[32]What changed? 'You got religion? \n[33]Gonna need you to help the good guys one more time, and track one more special for me. \n[34]Of course that's what you'd say. But then I got this theory that people don't really change. \n[35]Beware the light, Caliban. I bet that's what your Mommy said every day when you was a kid. \n[36]Beware the light. \n[37]Let's not bring out the worst in each other. The girl's not worth it. She's not a natural fuck-up like you. She's a business mistake. R &amp; D gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things with patents running around hurting people.

That's a phillips head. I need a torx. \n[43]What? \n[44]Get the fuck out of here. This shit's classified. \n[45]Look at that. Was found at the farmhouse. I know. It's her. But look at the other side. \n[46]Those are the coordinates of a fire road in the Badlands. A reservation near the Border. And, according to Wikipedia, its also this. \n[47]Gaby loved that shit. \n[48]Green juice is wearing down, huh? For an ol' mute, that a short high. Gonna be hard to keep those claws out soon. \n[49]Shit. Show some respect, mutey. You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind. \n[50]Dangerous times, James. We can't trust fate to-- \n[51]It's showtime, boy! \n[52]Get up! Get up, boy! That's right! He killed your Daddy! ", "GABRIELA": "\n[1]There are men after us. They almost got us today. We need to get to North Dakota. There, we can cross. To Canada. \n[2]No. It has to be you. I'll give you fifty thousand dollars \n[3]...Sightings... were posted. \n[4]On chat rooms. People said someone looked like The Wolverine was in El Paso, driving. Said he looked old. \n[5]Whoever it was, they were right. \n[6]No. Please. Stop! \n[7]Don't let her call anyone. They will find us. They will kill us. \n[8]I`m a nurse. Was. In Mexico City. \n[9]This morning. Near the border. I got away from them. But they know my car now. \n[10]Take it. Please. Bring us to this address. It's twenty thousand. You can have thirty more when we get there. My friends will-- \n[11]It doesn't matter. \n[12]My boyfriend. He wants to kill me. And take her. \n[13]...yes. He wants to hurt her. I know you are still good inside. I know you want to help. Please. There won't be any problems. Not if we leave now. \n[14]We have to be there Friday. \n[15]Or we miss our chance. To cross. Our... family. They will be there that day. No other day. \n[16]Bring us with you. Please. We can help with whatever you need to do. \n[17]I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City. \n[18]Transigen is a owned by an American company.

They were born here and they have never left. Never seen the sun or ocean, the rain or snow or any of God's creatures. \n[22]They have no birth certificates, no names beside the ones we have given them. They were raised in the bellies of Mexican girls. \n[23]--girls no one can find anymore. \n[24]Their fathers were semillas gen\u00e9tica, special seeds in bottles. \n[25]They told us they were part of a pharmaceutical study. \n[26]But of course, that was a lie. \n[27]They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand. We are poor, but we are not stupid. I knew what they were doing. \n[28]When I was a child, I learned English from these. \n[29]This is business. They are making soldiers. Weapons X. These are babies of mutantes muerta. \n[30]As the children became older, they became difficult to control. \n[31]They taught them to kill-- but they did not remove their hearts. \n[32]They could not be controlled. \n[33]A soldier who cannot be controlled is not a good soldier. \n[34]Inside this building is something new. Something better than X-23. \n[35]I got inside yesterday. \n[36]They told us to destroy files. They said the Cancer program had failed. \n[37]They started putting the children to sleep. Like dogs. \n[38]We are going to save as many as we can. I have read about a place in the north. A place for mutants. They call it Eden. \n[39]I have not shown anyone what you have now seen. Not until I am sure Laura is safe. \n[40]If you are watching this, it means I am dead. I am not sure if any other children survived. We were separated. I am sorry, but there is no more money. That was a lie. You have everything I have in my life. \n[41]She is not my child... but I love her. You may not love her but she is your child. I see now you are not a hero. You are not what I read about. Maybe you never were. But please, I beg you, please bring her to safety. ", "LAURA": "\n[1]Watches from a middle distance.

It won't last through the week. \n[3]Your turn. \n[4]You know, he told me last night he's communicating with someone. \n[5]Don't be so sure. He had all these details. I thought that tank was supposed to provide some sort of barrier. It's got all these cracks in it. What good is that? \n[6]He's been asking questions again. He's trying to read my mind. \n[7]I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things. \n[8]Well.

That seizure was a-- \n[10]It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look.
