{"dialogues": {"JORDY": "\n[1]Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!! \n[2]Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy? \n[3]Oh yeah?  Guess again. \n[4]Nice - how many people you ripped off tonight?!  Get up! \n[5]You couldn't listen to me, could you? \n[6]I'll send a cop back for you. \n[7]Hey, Louie, were you first due? \n[8]Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't make it a crime scene yet. \n[9]I heard.  Who the hell let them up there? \n[10]You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious? \n[11]Oh yeah, why? \n[12]Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents. \n[13]Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do. \n[14]Thanks.  Appreciate it. \n[15]Mouth's clean, too. \n[16]Don't blow your nose! \n[17]The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run. \n[18]So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? \n[19]And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them. \n[20]Evidence.  Of a homicide. \n[21]You know what that is, right? \n[22]Why don't you explain it, Bobby. Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor? \n[23]He knew all along. \n[24]That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us. \n[25]There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no! \n[26]I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry. \n[27]You okay? \n[28]Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.  \n[29]Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him. \n[30]Maybe you can be his stand-in. \n[31]Who do you think, Chief?! \n[32]'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it. \n[33]What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter. \n[34]How did you start the fire this time? \n[35]Yeah?  What kind? \n[36]That's it!  You're outta here. \n[37]What's so funny.  How does he know so much about me?  Who tells him my life story? \n[38]He's no joke!  One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big. \n[39]Her lips are fuller than that.  You can see 'em a mile away. \n[40]Her cheek bones are prominent and her eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she was looking to get away.  But she was absolutely beautiful. \n[41]I gotta good look at her. \n[42]How long they been livin' here? \n[43]You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene. \n[44]If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway. \n[45]It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want. \n[46]Nah, I musta missed it. \n[47]Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. \n[48]I don't even watch TV. \n[49]Did you get a report from the M.E.? \n[50]If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. What about the report? \n[51]The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. \n[52]Hmmmm. \n[53]Who says she's a suspect? \n[54]Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows? \n[55]Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. \n[56]Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally. \n[57]I'll come with you. \n[58]I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something. \n[59]My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle. \n[60]My folks are. \n[61]Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian? \n[62]You goin' to the escort service? \n[63]Mind if I ride along with you? \n[64]But what if it does?  You might need my help. \n[65]This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. \n[66]I'll call it... tails. \n[67]Two heads. \n[68]Do you remember the man who called? \n[69]This her? \n[70]I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already. \n[71]I'm on duty. \n[72]Of course. \n[73]I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. \n[74]...Daphne? \n[75]I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me from the other night?  You are Daphne, right? \n[76]Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?! \n[77]Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby. \n[78]She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. \n[79]Why not? \n[80]Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide. \n[81]Can I talk to you? \n[82]Raw deal. \n[83]Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her. \n[84]Yeah. \n[85]I don't have a girlfriend. \n[86]I'm serious here. \n[87]C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently. \n[88]You know what I'm saying here. \n[89]Hey.  I'm a professional. \n[90]If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation. \n[91]They won't until this is over. \n[92]Divorced. \n[93]I can't take you to my place. \n[94]The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. \n[95]Yeah.  This way. \n[96]You considered becoming a prostitute? \n[97]Did you ever turn tricks before? \n[98]What about back home? \n[99]So you were never a prostitute? \n[100]I'm just trying to find out who you are. \n[101]Showers are this way. \n[102]I'll uh, I'll get you a towel. \n[103]gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he notices the window.  It's open. \n[104]Shit! \n[105]Are you alright? \n[106]I know. \n[107]They're not gonna send you right back. \n[108]You can trust me.  \n[109]Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? \n[110]Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. \n[111]I let her take a shower. \n[112]No!  Nothing happened. \n[113]Will do, Chief. \n[114]Eddie, I... \n[115]Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. \n[116]I took her there for a shower and that's it. \n[117]Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... \n[118]I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. \n[119]But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. \n[120]Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that? \n[121]Not good. \n[122]Chief - mind if I take her? \n[123]Yeah. \n[124]The mugger. \n[125]I still can't believe Eddie's gone. \n[126]What's this? \n[127]Is he your boyfriend? \n[128]If I was your boyfriend, I might be. \n[129]A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one. \n[130]I'm glad I met you. \n[131]Let's get your stuff. \n[132]You better get packed. \n[133]Do you have coffee? \n[134]I'll make some for us. \n[135]No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!! \n[136]Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us! \n[137]This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped!  8th Avenue and 44th Street. \n[138]Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get down! \n[139]Oh Jesus! \n[140]What are you doing? \n[141]Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! Run! \n[142]It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to help you.  Get back!  Now! \n[143]Where's Daphne?  Daphne? \n[144]Get outta here! \n[145]They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment! \n[146]Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands up!  Drop it! \n[147]Turn that camera off! \n[148]Turn that camera off! \n[149]No way!  He's mine! \n[150]He's my collar! \n[151]He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in. \n[152]Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment? \n[153]Tommy, take a walk. \n[154]Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off. \n[155]Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy. \n[156]\n[157]Get your hands up!  Get your hands up! \n[158]You wanna be a real American?  Go for your gun. \n[159]Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and make more money. \n[160]You'll be my first. \n[161]Get down on your knees. \n[162]Where's your partner? \n[163]Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this up. \n[164]Don't move! \n[165]Drop the girl!  Drop her!! \n[166]\n[167]Where is he?  Where'd he go? \n[168]Everybody down!  Stay DOWN! \n[169]Shit! \n[170]What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. \n[171]Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. \n[172]End my career? \n[173]But Chief?  Over this?? \n[174]But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness! \n[175]We're gonna fight the extradition. \n[176]...Do you really want me to forget about you? \n[177]Daphne, I... \n[178]Hello? No comment. \n[179]Hello? No! \n[180]Whatever's leftover, keep. \n[181]You think this is funny??  What the hell are you laughing at? \n[182]This is it?  This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing? \n[183]And what about the other victims??  What about their families?  He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk? \n[184]Let her go.  Let her fucking go!! \n[185]Let her go!  Let her go!! \n[186]Let her go. \n[187]Let her go.  Let her go. \n[188]I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal. \n[189]No thanks. ", "EDDIE": "\n[1]So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off. \n[2]Vodka tonic. \n[3]What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me. \n[4]Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore. \n[5]I'm not moody. \n[6]How old are your kids? \n[7]Paulie, I need the cure. \n[8]Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday? \n[9]I'm gonna propose. \n[10]Tomorrow.  At lunch. \n[11]The thrill of the hunt.  I love it. \n[12]Not what.  Who. \n[13]He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle. \n[14]Yeah.  And he still went to the party. \n[15]Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the news and I look good.  But the problem with becoming a star is downtown.  They shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh. \n[16]I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me. \n[17]Keep them out of my way. \n[18]Yeah, yeah.  Jesus. \n[19]What's your rush?  Going to a party? \n[20]I don't know.  You always come outta your house that way? \n[21]Well, sounds like burglary to me. \n[22]Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time. \n[23]I don't know.  We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help. \n[24]Oh, sure. \n[25]No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon? \n[26]No, what is it? \n[27]A timer. \n[28]We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. \n[29]There are two bodies found at this point. \n[30]You know you can't do that.  C'mon. \n[31]We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know. \n[32]Okay to smoke? \n[33]Watch the news? \n[34]Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit. \n[35]Nah, why should you? \n[36]Good.  Good.  Commendable. \n[37]Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me? \n[38]You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal. \n[39]Pretty. \n[40]Maybe you don't care about that either. Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. \n[41]What would you call her? \n[42]Obviously they weren't having sex.  As you pointed out.  So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that? \n[43]Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary? \n[44]Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay. We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian... \n[45]There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do. \n[46]This isn't homicide school. \n[47]You're Polish? \n[48]Stay here. \n[49]Where is she? \n[50]Any I.D.? \n[51]It's okay. \n[52]After you. \n[53]Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room. \n[54]Any of you guys take a piss lately? \n[55]Do the seat for me. \n[56]Only one guys checked in? \n[57]C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful. \n[58]Our killer...our killer's standing here slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. The blood is splattering this way.  It's on this wall... And there's some specks over here. There's nothing here because someone was standing right here.  Someone big.  And he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. He wouldn't walk out of here like that. Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here? \n[59]What if the tip was broken off? \n[60]I think we've already found it. \n[61]Call communications and get an address on that number. \n[62]Good work. \n[63]You got any better ideas? \n[64]This has nothing to do with your fire. \n[65]I'll let you know what happens. \n[66]Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come. \n[67]Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads. \n[68]Heads.  See, you lost twice. Okay.  Get in. \n[69]Oh here.  A souvenir. \n[70]Better than one. \n[71]Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions. \n[72]Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up. \n[73]We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel. \n[74]Do you have any Czech girls working for you? \n[75]Did you tell him you did? \n[76]What are you saying? \n[77]Who came by looking for her? \n[78]Describe him. \n[79]He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly! \n[80]Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's. \n[81]You thirsty? \n[82]So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. \n[83]Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? \n[84]Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. \n[85]You don't have to be afraid.  We're here to protect you.  Come with me.  We want to talk to you.  You speak English alright?  \n[86]Did he give you these?  Was he just here? \n[87]The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera. Don't look - put her in the car. Stay this side. \n[88]Split up! \n[89]Are you hit? \n[90]I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers. \n[91]I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of. \n[92]I really can't give out any information right now at this point. \n[93]He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine. \n[94]Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. \n[95]Yeah.  Now's not a good time. \n[96]Alright? \n[97]Alright. \n[98]C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people? \n[99]Go on. \n[100]Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you. \n[101]Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you? \n[102]What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid \n[103]Is that all there is? \n[104]Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. \n[105]Something back home? \n[106]A cop? \n[107]Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth? \n[108]She's fucked.  Even if that story is true. \n[109]You wanna talk to her alone? \n[110]What would your girlfriend think of that? \n[111]My point exactly. \n[112]So am I. \n[113]You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building? \n[114]Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left. \n[115]Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs. \n[116]Staring right at us. \n[117]I want to talk to you about something serious. \n[118]I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don't know you've been married before and I've never been married, but I do love you, and... \n[119]Hey. \n[120]I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! \n[121]Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh... \n[122]Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? \n[123]I'm not. \n[124]Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was... \n[125]You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. \n[126]You're ruthless. \n[127]Could be Leon's. \n[128]You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet. \n[129]You know, Nicky, I've been married twice before.  My first wife was a professional woman, didn't have time for children.  My second wife...I never wanted to go home to her. \n[130]Answer the phone. \n[131]Answer it. \n[132]That's good. \n[133]Well, that's great. \n[134]No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great. \n[135]I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk. \n[136]I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me. \n[137]Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. \n[138]Tonight. \n[139]Yeah.  I promise. \n[140]Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. \n[141]See you later.  Good luck. \n[142]Don't be late. \n[143]I told him to take her there. \n[144]Tommy, get her outta here. \n[145]There was too much press hangin' around there.  I didn't want her face on the news.  So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down. \n[146]It was my decision, not his. \n[147]Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours. \n[148]I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us. \n[149]Wait. \n[150]Guys...give me a few minutes? \n[151]Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. \n[152]Just a shower? \n[153]No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. \n[154]Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. \n[155]How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it. \n[156]You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.  \n[157]It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did they check the hospitals?  Airports? Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia... \n[158]I'll call you later. \n[159]Coming! \n[160]Nicky!?!? \n[161]Nicky?! \n[162]What do you want? \n[163]What's your accomplishment. \n[164]Then do it, asshole. \n[165]If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck. \n[166]You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you? ", "EMIL": "\n[1]Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.

Surprise! \n[27]Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. \n[28]You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money? \n[29]Milos.  Get my money! \n[30]Ha. Ha. \n[31]A job? \n[32]As a plumber?! \n[33]A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work! \n[34]You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!? \n[35]She saw! \n[36]Daphne Hanlova. \n[37]Six month visa.  Still here two years later.  They'll deport her if she goes to Police. \n[38]I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.  \n[39]Self-esteem?  Self-esteem?? \n[40]Turn that fucking thing off! \n[41]Speak English! \n[42]How you erase this? \n[43]Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill him. What's this? \n[44]Worldly escorts? \n[45]Hello? \n[46]I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl? \n[47]I take her.  Send her! \n[48]Louder. \n[49]Louder. \n[50]I love America.  No one is responsible for what they do. \n[51]Get in the bathroom! \n[52]Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! \n[53]Where's Czech girl? \n[54]I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her? \n[55]Where is escort service? \n[56]I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address? \n[57]Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go. \n[58]Give me the address!! \n[59]Who is he? \n[60]Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? \n[61]Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? \n[62]Yes.  Both. \n[63]Get a taxi. \n[64]Let me help. \n[65]I...I have a temper. \n[66]When I lose it, I lose control.  I didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to prison, they beat me.  I still didn't tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos like a brother... \n[67]I'm not a killer. \n[68]Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a whore.  But washing hair?  This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair. \n[69]I don't want to kill you.  But if you talk, I will. I thought you'd want these. \n[70]Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go! \n[71]Shut up. \n[72]This is nothing. \n[73]Don't want to film this? \n[74]The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. \n[75]And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry. \n[76]Put the camera down, Oleg. \n[77]What does it look like?  It's an address book! \n[78]Sit down! \n[79]So...who's Nicky? \n[80]Your opinion. You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books. \n[81]I kill someone famous. \n[82]Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero. \n[83]So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time. \n[84]Turn it off. \n[85]No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous! \n[86]Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? \n[87]Okay.  He has nothing to say. Start the camera! \n[88]Bad last moment - I cut that out. \n[89]Die.  Die.  \n[90]Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film. \n[91]No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you. \n[92]We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars. \n[93]If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it. \n[94]Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering. \n[95]America!  Who says you can't be success in America?  I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a success story! \n[96]Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are! \n[97]The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael. \n[98]Shut up.  Look! \n[99]Bad last moment - I cut it out. \n[100]I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! \n[101]Die.

Yes, come with me! \n[118]My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend. \n[119]You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.

He'll kill you. \n[122]You bring the cigarettes? \n[123]I was all of these. \n[124]What about Oleg? \n[125]No, he is here.  Shit... \n[126]What about my movie rights?  Book rights? \n[127]What's your cut?  How much? \n[128]No.  No way. \n[129]Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no. \n[130]What else do you need? \n[131]Give me another one, please. \n[132]My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind. \n[133]Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me. \n[134]Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness... \n[135]Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out? \n[136]That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. \n[137]Out on my back when I was a small boy. \n[138]I'm abused.  Don't you think? \n[139]Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm insane. \n[140]...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... \n[141]Traitor!! \n[142]I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back away from me! \n[143]Tell him to put his gun down! \n[144]If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her. \n[145]Shut up! \n[146]Shut up! \n[147]I'll surrender!!

I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! \n[51]I'd never had a great relationship before.  I'd never made great choices with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to know.  He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him. But he was so great to me.  Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything... He was the one.  You know, I'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time.

No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called \"It's a Wonderful Life\" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white. \n[10]Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies! \n[11]Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? \n[12]Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision. \n[13]Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog. \n[14]What? \n[15]Hello, Tamina. \n[16]What are you looking for? \n[17]I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer. Don't break it!

Everything is so messy.  Everything is so crazy right here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 90% of people who die in fire die from eating smoke.  So most likely they all die from eating smoke. \n[43]And this is the man who started the fire.

You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming.  It would be only normal to ask, why?  Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it.  A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward.  Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. \n[34]This footage will work in your favor.

She shoots him a disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch - anxious - looks at his cameraman. \n[38]He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he comes through the crowd.  Do you hear me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this. \n[39]Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?! \n[40]I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where is it?  Where is the tape? \n[41]Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at! \n[42]I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane!

Go get it and bring it here this minute. \n[28]Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV, I'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth! \n[29]I'll take him. \n[30]We're takin' him.

You want to speak to someone - you speak to me! \n[9]Don't you put your hands on me, Detective. \n[10]My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. What's happened is not his fault.  Emil was under the influence of his partner. At the trial, you'll see that my client will be vindicated... \n[11]I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check. \n[12]Oh, sure. \n[13]How're they treating you, alright I want to get the cuffs off... but there's a little bit of a problem. Things out there are very negative right now for us.  We gotta change that around.  Perception is very, very important.  Perception is reality.  I know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's important that I get that message out. Cause that's our only defense in this case. \n[14]I want you to focus on three things: fear... \n[15]...delusions and paranoia. \n[16]Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.

I need your trust in me. \n[23]I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here. \n[24]Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like. \n[25]Your mother was blind? \n[26]Back in the Czech Republic? \n[27]Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness? \n[28]Your father put cigarettes out on you? \n[29]Can I see your back? \n[30]Oh, Jesus. \n[31]I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. \n[32]...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! \n[33]...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. \n[34]Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions. \n[35]You may not like it marshal, but that's the law. \n[36]Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!

To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident. \n[12]Here you go.  A big double homicide. \n[13]You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it. \n[14]What?? \n[15]What? \n[16]Yeah? \n[17]Yeah, right. \n[18]I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.

You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! \n[21]Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. \n[22]How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield. \n[23]There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.
