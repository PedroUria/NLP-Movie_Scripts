{"dialogues": {"MILLER": "\n[1]I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in? \n[2]Justin? \n[3]Start the countdown. \n[4]Let's go. \n[5]Kill it. \n[6]Don't start with me, Cooper. \n[7]The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks. \n[8]What's the hold up? \n[9]I put in for a replacement for you but no one... \n[10]I am sorry. But now we have to go to work. \n[11]Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why. \n[12]Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way. \n[13]Five minutes. \n[14]Starck, why aren't you on the bridge? \n[15]Then what are you doing here? Come on, people, let's go! And Cooper... Put some pants on. \n[16]That's good to know. Justin, you wanna stow that? \n[17]Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer -- \n[18]This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway? \n[19]He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ... \n[20]And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why. \n[21]EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak. \n[22]Where has it been for the last seven years? \n[23]What is that? \n[24]What does it say? \n[25]You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years? \n[26]You heard the tape, Smith. We're looking for survivors. \n[27]Come around to three-three-four... \n[28]...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees... \n[29]Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening... \n[30]We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out... \n[31]What are you trying to say? \"If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?\" \n[32]I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady. \n[33]Dr. Weir...! \n[34]I think you want to see this. \n[35]I noticed. Starck, anybody home? \n[36]Where is it? \n[37]Starck... \n[38]Reverse thrusters full! \n[39]Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby? \n[40]Do it. \n[41]Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster. \n[42]Starck, give me a read. \n[43]Find 'em, Starck. \n[44]Radiation interference? \n[45]Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on. \n[46]Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge. \n[47]Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board -- \n[48]-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is! I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job. \n[49]You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens... \n[50]Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark. \n[51]Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze. \n[52]Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright? \n[53]Dr. Weir, what's this? \n[54]I can see that, what're they for? \n[55]So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan? \n[56]Peters is right, no one's here. \n[57]Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep. \n[58]Starck, you still showing those readings? \n[59]Keep your eyes open. \n[60]Negative. \n[61]They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward. \n[62]If we saw any crew, Doctor, you'd know about it. I'm in Medical. No casualties, it looks like this place has never been used. \n[63]The blood came from somewhere, Peters... \n[64]What you got, Peters? \n[65]The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here. \n[66]Alive? \n[67]Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters... \n[68]...how's the client? \n[69]Justin, finish your sweep. \n[70]What the hell... \n[71]Oh shit...! \n[72]Boarding party, sound off... Peters, do you read me... . Peters... \n[73]...Peters, do you read me... \n[74]Justin? Justin, sound off... Justin...! \n[75]A BURNING MAN stands in Medical/Science, a human body wreathed in flame. The eyes are like sunspots. As the Burning Man moves, bones and black flesh poke through the fire. He raises one hand to point at Miller in accusation... \n[76]Can anybody hear me... \n[77]Peters... \n[78]...you okay? \n[79]Coop, where are you... \n[80]Hold on, Coop... \n[81]Smith, where the hell have you been?! \n[82]Do we have enough time for a weld? \n[83]No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks? \n[84]Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock. \n[85]You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me? \n[86]Everybody okay? \n[87]Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought. \n[88]No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers. \n[89]But you can breathe it. \n[90]How much oh-two do we have? \n[91]Carbon dioxide? \n[92]We can take the filters from the Clark... \n[93]What about the life readings you picked up? \n[94]What's causing the readings? \n[95]So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions? \n[96]What happened here? \n[97]I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark? \n[98]We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air. \n[99]How is he? \n[100]DJ, take samples from these stains, compare them to medical records, I want to know whose blood this is. \n[101]Okay, people, there's been a change in the mission. In less than eighteen hours, we will run out of breathable air. Our primary objective is now survival. That means we focus on repairing the Lewis and Clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time. Our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew. Two months from now, I fully intend to be standing in front of the good Admiral giving my report, and I'd like to have more than my dick in my hands. \n[102]Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers. \n[103]Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan... \n[104]Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found. \n[105]Do it. Dr. Weir... \n[106]One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him. \n[107]Cooper! Enough! \n[108]Dr. Weir, Justin may die. Whatever happened to him could happen to all of us. \n[109]Hold on, what's this \"gravitational distortion?\" \n[110]What could cause them? What's in the Core? \n[111]How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core? \n[112]It's insane. \n[113]If it worked. \n[114]I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits. \n[115]Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men. No one goes near that thing. \n[116]You have something, Dr. Weir? \n[117]What about it? \n[118]It's 2041... \n[119]Explanation? \n[120]I wonder if they ever made it. \n[121]What the hell is that? Dr. Weir? \n[122]Do it. \n[123]We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it. \n[124]Wait! \n[125]The rest of you, stay here, I don't want anyone else going near that thing. \n[126]No radiation. What's causing the drain? \n[127]We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad. \n[128]We just lost all power in here. Dr. Weir...? \n[129]Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared. \n[130]No. It was someone else. \n[131]Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something... \n[132]Peters is right. Its like something reaching into your mind. Seeing your thoughts and making them real. Smith, did you or Cooper experience anything unusual? \n[133]Smith... \n[134]That's enough! \n[135]\n[136]That's it, that's enough for one day, Smith! I need you back on the Clark, I need you calm, I need you using your head, you make a mistake out there, none of are getting home, you understand? \n[137]Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly. \n[138]We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time. \n[139]Do it. \n[140]I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers. \n[141]What is it, Starck? \n[142]\"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin,\" don't you have anything useful to tell me? \n[143]Go ahead. \n[144]I don't need to hear this. \n[145]To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive? \n[146]We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories... \n[147]Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible. \n[148]If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time? \n[149]What I want is to survive the next ten hours. \n[150]I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about. \n[151]That's a negative, Starck. \n[152]What's going on in there, Starck? \n[153]What? \n[154]Stay here! Don't stop working! \n[155]I'll get him. \n[156]I'm on my way, Starck. \n[157]Patch me through to him. \n[158]Justin. \n[159]They can't do that Justin, now listen carefully... \n[160]You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright? \n[161]Justin. I won't let you die. \n[162]Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can! \n[163]Exhale everything you got, Baby Bear, we can't have any air in those lungs, blow it all out... \n[164]We'll make it. \n[165]Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us. \n[166]Thanks. \n[167]Is that your \"expert opinion?\" The only answer we've had out of you is \"I don't know.\" \n[168]I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock. \n[169]That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit! \n[170]You said this ship creates a gateway... \n[171]To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it? \n[172]Where has it been for the past seven years? \n[173]The \"Other Place,\" what is that...? \n[174]That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor. \n[175]Any change? \n[176]Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things. I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close. \n[177]It was on the Goliath. There was this bosun, Corrick, a young guy, a lot like Justin. Edmund Corrick, from Decatur, Georgia. He got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm. Severed it at the wrist. The pain of that must have been... He passed out and... \n[178]I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone. I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of. And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide. \n[179]What is it? \n[180]Go on. \n[181]It's not a distress call. It's a warning. \n[182]Hear what? \n[183]\"Save yourself. From Hell.\" What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed? \n[184]On my way. \n[185]Alright, Cooper. \n[186]You got it, Coop. \n[187]Back in business. \n[188]We're leaving. \n[189]\"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship.\" The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us. \n[190]Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is. Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark. \n[191]It's done. \n[192]We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed. Fuck this ship. \n[193]Watch me. \n[194]Starck, what the hell is going on? \n[195]Goddammit! Starck, get those files and vacate. I want off this ship. \n[196]Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home. \n[197]Weir? WEIR! \n[198]All hands. Dr. Weir is missing. I want him found and restrained. \n[199]Thank you. \n[200]Now what? \n[201]Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her. \n[202]What is it, Smith? \n[203]Smith, get out of there... \n[204]One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. \n[205]Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock. \n[206]Get out of there now! \n[207]Smith? Smith! Fuck! \n[208]\n[209]DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead. \n[210]Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor. \n[211]DJ, you read me? \n[212]DJ? DJ, come in... \n[213]Peters... \n[214]Peters, are you there? \n[215]Starck, do you read me? Starck...? \n[216]Son of a bitch! \n[217]Oh my God. \n[218]Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do \n[219]Oh God... \n[220]Weir. \n[221]Hold on... Get you outta these... \n[222]Your eyes... \n[223]What are you talking about? \n[224]What are you doing? \n[225]If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too. \n[226]Give me your hand! Your hand! \n[227]The forward airlock. \n[228]Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir. \n[229]Stay behind me. \n[230]It's not over. It's just starting. \n[231]Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place. \n[232]\n[233]We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put... \n[234]You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives. \n[235]It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks. \n[236]No. I'll be right back. \n[237]Close it behind me. Just in case. \n[238]We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow... \n[239]...repeat, we're armed... \n[240]Slow down, Starck, I can't understand you, who was in the tank? \n[241]Who? Who? \n[242]He's dead... \n[243]You're dead, I saw you die. \n[244]Then who the fuck are you? \n[245]Corrick... \n[246]That's not true... \n[247]\n[248]You're not Edmund Corrick. \n[249]What are you? \n[250]You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit! \n[251]Then what, what are you? Tell me... \n[252]\n[253]You can't have them! \n[254]...not the Devil... \n[255]You're lying...! \n[256]Starck... Cooper... \n[257]You can't have them. Go to hell. ", "WEIR": "\n[1]I miss you. \n[2]This is Weir. \n[3]You wanted to see me, Admiral? \n[4]Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax? \n[5]It's the Event Horizon. She's come back. \n[6]A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them. \n[7]I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle. \n[8]This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all! The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream. I have to go. \n[9]The crew? Could they still be alive? \n[10]Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship. \n[11]Thank you. \n[12]Captain Miller, I just want to say... \n[13]Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity... \n[14]I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space. \n[15]Yes. \n[16]He's been past Mars? \n[17]Wasn't that ship destroyed? \n[18]I've seen the effect on mice. \n[19]Claire? \n[20]Claire? I'm sorry. Claire? \n[21]Claire... \n[22]I'm alright now. I'm alright... \n[23]What? \n[24]No, thank you. \n[25]What I am about to tell you is considered code-black by the NSA. \n[26]The USAC intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around Neptune. The source has been identified as the Event Horizon. \n[27]What was made public about the Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that its reactor went critical, that the ship blew up... None of that is true. The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight. \n[28]Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously \"jump\" from one point in the universe to another, light years away. \n[29]Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity... \n[30]Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from \"point A\" here... ...to \"point B,\" here. Now: what's the shortest distance between two points? \n[31]Wrong. The shortest distance between two points... \n[32]...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive. \n[33]I built it. \n[34]It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now. \n[35]That's what we're here to find out. \n[36]We haven't been able to confirm any live contact, but TDRSS did receive a single transmission from the Event Horizon. \n[37]Houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice. \n[38]NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message... \n[39]There: \"...liberatis me...\" They haven't been able to translate the rest, it's too distorted. \n[40]The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now. \n[41]Where is she? \n[42]I can't see anything... \n[43]She's not ugly. \n[44]Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer? \n[45]That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there. \n[46]Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure... \n[47]Do they have pressure? \n[48]Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan? \n[49]Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship... \n[50]That is not acceptable -- \n[51]Very well. \n[52]You've reached the outer airlock door. \n[53]You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering. \n[54]They're explosive charges. \n[55]In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat. \n[56]Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead. \n[57]Any survivors? \n[58]No one? \n[59]You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side. \n[60]Background radiation. Perfectly safe. \n[61]You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew? \n[62]Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that? \n[63]Can you see a body? \n[64]Ms. Peters, turn back and to your left, please. \n[65]Ship's log. \n[66]That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering. \n[67]That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship. \n[68]What is it? \n[69]We're losing atmosphere... \n[70]The Event Horizon. \n[71]It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support. \n[72]It beats dying, Mister Smith. \n[73]Yes. \n[74]No, he didn't. \n[75]Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible... \n[76]I don't know what happened to Justin. \n[77]What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion. \n[78]It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark. \n[79]It's complicated... \n[80]A black hole. \n[81]That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light. \n[82]\"Insane?\" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day... \n[83]If it worked, yes. \n[84]There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control. \n[85]Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all. \n[86]Yes. \n[87]Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now. \n[88]These things happen. Wait a minute, that's not right... \n[89]The date. \n[90]The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034. \n[91]Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years. \n[92]No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years. \n[93]Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible... Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened... The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead. \n[94]John Kilpack. \n[95]I don't know. \n[96]The Core...! \n[97]The magnetic fields are holding. Maybe a short in the fail-safe circuit. I'll check it out. \n[98]Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries. \n[99]E-three... E-five... E-seven... where are you... \n[100]There you are. \n[101]Um. Captain Miller? I, uh, I seem to have a problem with my light. \n[102]Captain Miller? \n[103]Claire...? \n[104]No. I saw nothing. \n[105]Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge? \n[106]Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith. \n[107]Carbon dioxide. \n[108]I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain. \n[109]It wants me. I have to go. \n[110]I'm alright. Please. \n[111]The forward airlock. \n[112]It means nothing. \n[113]Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane. \n[114]What? \n[115]I said that? \n[116]I don't remember saying that. Maybe I'm insane, too. \n[117]Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations -- \n[118]What do you want me to say? \n[119]Yes... \n[120]I don't know... \n[121]I don't know... \n[122]\n[123]You can't, your orders are specific... \n[124]You're insane. You've lost your mind. \n[125]Don't... don't do this... \n[126]What about my ship? \n[127]You... You can't do that! \n[128]You can't kill her, I won't let you! I lost her once, I will not lose her again...! \n[129]You can't leave. She won't let you. \n[130]I am home. \n[131]I won't. I won't leave. This is my ship. \n[132]Oh no. Peters...? \n[133]Why did you do that? You didn't have to do that... \n[134]I told you... She won't let you leave... \n[135]I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see. \n[136]Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is? It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil. It's a liberating experience. \n[137]What makes you think I'll miss? \n[138]Weir is dead. \n[139]Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller? \n[140]You know. \n[141]I'm not the Devil. \n[142]Better if I just show you. \n[143]I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much older. I watched the Beginning and I will see the End. I am the dark behind the stars. I am the dark inside you all. \n[144]There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING. \n[145]I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me. \n[146]They are mine. And so are you... \n[147]", "STARCK": "\n[1]Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own. \n[2]We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready. \n[3]Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes. \n[4]It is not. \n[5]Maybe when you finish puberty. \n[6]I just finished drying... \n[7]All boards are green, everything's five by five. \n[8]That's impossible!

It's a dead language. \n[13]Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees. \n[14]This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... \n[15]If they are, they're screening their calls. \n[16]The scope is lit, it's right in front of us... \n[17]It should be right there... \n[18]My God. \n[19]Picking up magnetic interference. \n[20]Look at the size of that thing. \n[21]The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. \n[22]Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis. \n[23]Something's wrong with the bio-scan. \n[24]There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location. \n[25]If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense. \n[26]I'm running diagnostics now, Skipper... Nothing's wrong with the sensor pack, I'm still getting trace life readings, all over the ship. \n[27]Not according to the computer. \n[28]That's an affirmative. \n[29]What is it? \n[30]What happened to his eyes? \n[31]Decompression wouldn't do that. \n[32]You okay? \n[33]Justin, hold on a sec, you're breaking up... \n[34]Justin...? \n[35]Justin, come in... \n[36]I don't know.

Hold on! \n[41]We lost the starboard baffle! The hull's been breached! \n[42]There are pressure suits in the Airlock. Go! \n[43]What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever. \n[44]We're all here. \n[45]It tastes bad. \n[46]The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us. \n[47]Oxygen is not the problem. \n[48]It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot. \n[49]I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home. \n[50]The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: \"Bio-readings of indeterminate origin.\" Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels. \n[51]I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew. \n[52]What's the point? I'll just get the same thing... \n[53]I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins. \n[54]I can't believe we built this. \n[55]Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love. \n[56]Claire is your wife? \n[57]It must be hard, being so far away from her. \n[58]I'm sorry. \n[59]Maybe a power interruption crashed the system... \n[60]What the hell... \n[61]Skipper, the bio-scan just went off the scale... \n[62]Maybe one of the original crew? \n[63]Who? \n[64]Miller... \n[65]...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin... \n[66]I've got a theory. \n[67]There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system... \n[68]You've got to listen... \n[69]I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us... \n[70]It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports... \n[71]I know that. \n[72]I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have. \n[73]Nine hours and twenty-two minutes. \n[74]Heard what? \n[75]What are you doing? \n[76]No...! \n[77]In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset. \n[78]What is it? \n[79]Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock? \n[80]Miller, come in... \n[81]Justin's in the airlock. \n[82]He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit. \n[83]He's engaged the override. \n[84]I'll try. DJ, you better get your bag of tricks. \n[85]You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door. \n[86]Keep him talking. \n[87]I don't think she can talk him down. We need a sedative. \n[88]Almost got it. \n[89]I can't! The inner door can't open once the outer door has been triggered, it would decompress the entire ship! \n[90]Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay... \n[91]Five seconds. \n[92]CO2 levels will reach toxic levels in four hours. \n[93]Justin said something about, \"The dark inside me...\" What did he mean? \n[94]On the bridge. You said \"it\" wanted you. \n[95]It's cold. \n[96]Miller, come in ... \n[97]We just lost main power again. \n[98]Don't leave me! \n[99]Please... help, help me... \n[100]Weir can't be alive. \n[101]Cooper! \n[102]You're okay now, it's over... \n[103]We've got to shut it down, we've got to... \n[104]There must be a way! What about Engineering? \n[105]I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert... \n[106]Blow it up? \n[107]I'll do it -- \n[108]Don't be long. \n[109]Hurry. \n[110]Cooper...! \n[111]Run! \n[112]Miller, he's back, he was in the tank... \n[113]You have to get back here now, he's out there now, if he finds you... \n[114]Weir. \n[115]Miller...

They're been gone seven years. \n[8]You're not seriously considering sending him? \n[9]The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss. \n[10]Does he know that? \n[11]He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it. And then there's his wife. \n[12]Some things you don't get over. \n[13]The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four. ", "HOLLIS": "\n[1]I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle? \n[2]I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes. \n[3]That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible. Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage. We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew... \n[4]It's not that simple. Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir. \n[5]It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day. \n[6]Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors. \n[7]You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein. \n[8]That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship. \n[9]What's on your mind? \n[10]It's been two years since she died. He's over it. \n[11]I want our best people on this. Where's Miller? ", "VOICE": "\n[1]Billy... \n[2]I'm so cold... \n[3]I'm so cold... \n[4]Don't leave me... \n[5]Billy. \n[6]Don't leave me...! "}}
