There's a penny inside. For luck in our new loft. It's a good omen. \n[8]It's gonna be great. \n[9]I hate pitching to these Japanese guys. They make me nervous. I mean, what am I supposed to say, \"Who do you think'll win that big Sumo championship\"? \n[10]...Molly. \n[11]Better pay off your Mustang first. \n[12]So Carl, what did the doctor say? \n[13]And what about the rash? \n[14]On your genitals again? \n[15]Morning Rose. Listen, when the Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore take them right to the... \n[16]They're early! \n[17]Noon? Damn! \n[18]Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by noon. Can you transfer it to his payroll account? \n[19]Discretion, huh? \n[20]Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf of Market Security Bank &amp; Trust, I welcome you to our city. \n[21]I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York. But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace. \n[22]Excuse me. Hello? \n[23]straight-faced, listening and trying to look as if it is important. \n[24]Uh hmm. \n[25]Okay. \n[26]Well, that's just fine. \n[27]Thank you. I'll remember that. \n[28]Saved your life. \n[29]Better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. Here, look out. \n[30]I couldn't keep him away. \n[31]What do you mean? It's comfortable. For T.V. I love that chair. \n[32]It goes with me. \n[33]It was the middle of December. I was sitting in my old office, the one Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this woman screaming. I thought someone'd been shot or something. \n[34]She was four thousand dollars over her limit. \n[35]She's still angry. \n[36]Get outta here, Frank! You should have seen her. All pink and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. And she's screaming, demanding to see the president. So Wilton brought her to me. \n[37]She didn't know that. \n[38]What's a Montana accent? \n[39]I wasn't nervous. \n[40]I thought you were cute. \n[41]What are you doing? \n[42]At 2:00 am? \n[43]You notice Carl's eyes today? They were all over you. \n[44]I feel inspired. \n[45]The matter? \n[46]Nothing... really. \n[47]No. Not really. \n[48]I don't know. A lot of things. I just don't want the bubble to burst... Whenever something good happens to me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it. \n[49]What? \n[50]Ditto. \n[51]Oh Jesus. Another one. \n[52]I should cancel my L.A. trip... These things always happen in threes. \n[53]Yeah. So did they. \n[54]Amazing, huh? Just like that. Blackout. \n[55]A glitch. What's up? \n[56]I changed it. \n[57]Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit... Can you keep your mouth shut? \n[58]I think I've stumbled onto something. There's too much money in these accounts. \n[59]That's what I keep asking myself. \n[60]I've been checking. \n[61]Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit. \n[62]We're going to the theatre. She wants to see \"Macbeth\" at the Spring Street Repertory. \n[63]I loved it. \n[64]Six times. \n[65]Molly, the \"New York Times\" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. Who cares what The New York Times thinks? \n[66]Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks. \n[67]What? \n[68]It's just been so long since... I mean, you never wanted to talk about it. \n[69]What do you think, Moll? \n[70]What are you talking about? \n[71]People say \"I love you\" all the time. It doesn't mean anything. \n[72]Let me handle this. \n[73]Take the money. Just leave the wallet and my... \n[74]Molly! \n[75]No!!!!!! \n[76]This isn't happening. It's not happening. \n[77]Help me! \n[78]Do it! Do it! \n[79]Molly? Molly! \n[80]Molly! \n[81]What's happening to me?! \n[82]Molly! \n[83]Molly. \n[84]Don't stop!

I am. \n[93]Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my favorite... \n[94]Molly, don't. \n[95]Say something. Help her, Carl. \n[96]Oh good. That's really good. \n[97]Molly, we hated that concert. \n[98]Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll? \n[99]Hey, Molly! Wait! \n[100]pulling back from the door.

You've gotta help me. \n[192]You're right. And they'll be back. I'm your only chance. \n[193]I need you Oda Mae. I need you to get some fake ID's. \n[194]Help me now, they'll never bother you again. I promise. \n[195]I'll teach you. You'll learn fast. \n[196]See where it says \"New Accounts\"? That's where you're going. \n[197]Just do what I say. \n[198]Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account. \n[199]Yes. 926-31043. \n[200]Rita Miller. \n[201]Tell her Rita Miller. \n[202]Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today. \n[203]Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line. \n[204]No, no, no.

Tell him Rita Miller's here. \n[208]Don't embellish. \n[209]Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk. \n[210]Just be quiet and listen. I've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul. \n[211]He's a social moron. You don't have to worry about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year. \n[212]This'll be easy. Furgeson was so drunk at that party, he could have had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember. \n[213]Ask how Bobby and Snooky are. \n[214]Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities. \n[215]\"We sure did!\" \n[216]\"Good old Randy\". \n[217]\"Her\" shoulders. \n[218]You're closing an account. \n[219]926-31043. \n[220]31-0-43. \n[221]Say \"yes\"! \n[222]A cashier's check!

Endorse it now. \n[232]We're giving it away. \n[233]Look to your left. \n[234]Do what I tell you. \n[235]Yes, you can. If you don't do it, they'll track you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now. \n[236]I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go to heaven for this. \n[237]Write \"St. Joseph's Shelter\". \n[238]I'm proud of you. \n[239]Come on, we're friends. \n[240]I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae. \n[241]Search, you bastard!

There's still Carl. \n[254]Tell him to hurry! \n[255]Tell her she's wearing the blouse I spilled the Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas. \n[256]Gimme a penny quick. \n[257]Empty your purse. On the floor. Now. \n[258]Push a penny under the door. \n[259]Tell her it's for luck. \n[260]I'm sitting beside you. \n[261]With all my heart. \n[262]I'd give anything to be alive again, just to feel you once more. \n[263]No! \n[264]What's happening to me? \n[265]Get out of here! The fire escape. \n[266]Goodbye, Moll. \n[267]Molly?! \n[268]I can't stay anymore. \n[269]I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. Thank you. Your mama would be proud. \n[270]I love you, Molly.

Umm, can I keep the pen? \n[122]Thanks. \n[123]Lyle Furgeson, please. \n[124]No. I'm here for the fun of it. \n[125]Tell him Rita Miller's here. \n[126]Yes, Sir. \n[127]Why are you whispering? \n[128]What? He doesn't remember me? We were together at the Brewster's Christmas party. With his wife Shirley. They had that lovely tree... all those presents. Why, I'll never forget all those beautiful... \n[129]Oops. Gas. \n[130]A long time. \n[131]How are Bobby and Snooky doin'? \n[132]Couldn't be better. \n[133]So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities? \n[134]We sure did. \n[135]Good old Randy. Got a real head on his shoulders. \n[136]\"Her\" shoulders. \n[137]I'm closing an account. \n[138]926-3143. \n[139]Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm dyslexic. \n[140]Four million dollars?! \n[141]Yes! Four million. That's right. That's right. \n[142]Tens and twenties? \n[143]A cashier's check. \n[144]Of course. \n[145]You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long. \n[146]Sure. \n[147]I sure do. \n[148]Then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps. Every gas station has 'em you know, sometimes six or more. It adds up. \n[149]Well, I've got to leave. It's been a pleasure doin' business with you. Say \"hi\" to Shirley and Snooky for me. \n[150]What a day! \n[151]$4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty. \n[152]Take it out? Why? \n[153]Endorse it? Why? \n[154]No! \n[155]What are you going to do with it? \n[156]Away? What do you mean? To who? \n[157]Are you outta your mind? \n[158]No! I can't. \n[159]Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam. \n[160]Don't you talk to me. I don't want you comin' round no more. I mean it. Understand? \n[161]Friends? Friends? \n[162]Sam! \n[163]What're you doin' here? \n[164]The check? What do you mean, \"the check\". You said they'd never find out. \n[165]They're comin' to kill me. What have you done? \n[166]Jesus have mercy. \n[167]Emergency! Let us in! \n[168]in the elderly woman's vestibule, peering through the peephole. The old woman is struggling and still trying to talk. Oda Mae's knees are wobbling. \n[169]They're gonna find us. \n[170]Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that? \n[171]Sam? What happened? \n[172]Dead! Oh, thank God. It's over. \n[173]Who's Carl? \n[174]Can't you hurry up? \n[175]Problems? \n[176]Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you think of me, but your life is in danger. You have to listen to me. Sam's here, too. You gotta let us in. \n[177]Go ahead. We want you to call 'em. You're in trouble. Let us in. \n[178]Sam's death was no accident. He was murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering money at the bank. Sam found out. He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. He'll kill you, too. \n[179]Sam says you're wearin' the blouse he spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas. \n[180]See, I'm no fake. \n[181]What? \n[182]Sam says it's for luck. \n[183]Just wait. \n[184]Right here. \n[185]With all his heart, he says. \n[186]He wishes he could touch you, just one more time. \n[187]Okay, damn it, you can use me if you want. \n[188]Come on. Before I change my mind. \n[189]Wait! \n[190]Come with me. \n[191]Back to the fire escape. Head for the roof. \n[192]Help us, Sam! \n[193]A hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the floor. \n[194]In my purse. \n[195]Over there. \n[196]I gave it away. \n[197]They're waiting for you, Sam. ", "MOLLY": "\n[1]What a mess! \n[2]Use your mask, dummy. \n[3]Sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there. \n[4]We have all this height, Sam. We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this space. \n[5]For space. Just space. \n[6]Hey, Sam, turn around. \n[7]All together now. One, two, three. \n[8]You're the good omen. \n[9]It's gorgeous. \n[10]Sell it? Carl, we just bought it. \n[11]dressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into the phone. \n[12]A man and a woman are lying in bed when the woman's husband suddenly comes home. Frightened, she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window. He has no time to dress. \n[13]It's raining outside. The man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching. \n[14]One of the joggers calls out. \"Hey, do you always go jogging naked?\" And the man says, \"Yes, always.\" \n[15]And then the other jogger says, \"And do you always wear a condom?\" The man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, \"Only when it's raining.\" \n[16]Now just relax and have fun, okay? It's not the end of the world if you lose this account. You've always got me. \n[17]See ya. \n[18]Where you guys from, the New York City Ballet? \n[19]You bastard. Don't do that to me. You scared me half to death. \n[20]Carl? Did you invite him? \n[21]In the bedroom. \n[22]You like it, huh? \n[23]Sam, you kept that chair? \n[24]But it doesn't go with anything. \n[25]It's okay, I'll paint it. \n[26]They took away my MasterCard. It was Christmas, for godssake. \n[27]It wasn't four thousand. And I'd already sent in the payment! You're the ones that lost it. \n[28]No I'm not. \n[29]Can you believe it? And the next thing I know, he's telling me his life story. I couldn't believe it. Everything. About his divorce, how he'd just arrived in New York, how he didn't know any women. And all with this Montana accent. \n[30]The one you always slip into it when you get nervous. \"Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts, Ma'am?\" \n[31]Admit it. You liked me. You were interested. \n[32]Cute? Do you believe this? I should have been Picasso's mistress. I should have been living in Barcelona or Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a New York banker who thinks I'm cute. \n[33]I felt inspired. \n[34]What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me tell you something. He's not even looking at me. It's you he idolizes. He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, he's not my type. \n[35]What are you doing? \n[36]What's the matter? \n[37]I can tell. \n[38]You're worried, aren't you? About moving in together? \n[39]Then what? The promotion? \n[40]You know what? \n[41]I love you. I really love you. \n[42]Don't watch that stuff. \n[43]Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides, you lead a charmed life. \n[44]I could tell. \n[45]Did I tell you what Marcia said? \n[46]Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so blas\u00e9. I'll have two major pieces in the show. The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time. This could be huge. \n[47]Eight million readers, that's who. \n[48]I want to marry you, Sam. \n[49]I've been thinking about it for days. More than thinking. I want to do it. I want to jump in whole hog... What is that look for? \n[50]Do you love me, Sam? \n[51]How come you never say it? \n[52]You say \"ditto\". It's not the same. \n[53]Sometimes you need to hear it. \n[54]What should we do? \n[55]Give it to him! \n[56]Sam, No! \n[57]Sam!!!!! \n[58]Sam? What's the matter? Is something wrong? \n[59]What is it, honey? \n[60]What is it, honey? \n[61]Don't leave me. I need you, Sam. \n[62]Oh God, Sam... \n[63]I picked up your shirts this morning. I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said to tell you hello. I broke into tears. It's so hard... \n[64]I think about you every minute. It's like you're still here, like I can feel you, Sam. \n[65]Frank, what's wrong? Frank? \n[66]Sam? \n[67]Sam's address book. \n[68]No! \n[69]I miss him, Carl. \n[70]Wait. Wait. Not that one. \n[71]No. \n[72]I can't do it Carl. \n[73]Okay. Just a short walk. \n[74]Frank, what's wrong? \n[75]Hello. \n[76]Yes. \n[77]Who is this? \n[78]What? \n[79]Hello, who's there? \n[80]Why should I believe you? Why should I believe any of this? \n[81]He did that? That's how he got me to go out with him. \n[82]I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy. I can't believe I'm talking to you like this. I don't believe in these things. I don't believe in life after death. \n[83]You're talking to him right now? \n[84]Where is he? \n[85]I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why are you doing this to me? I don't believe a word you're saying. Sam is dead. He's dead. \n[86]No. He would never say that. \n[87]Sam? \n[88]I don't understand. Why did he come back? Why is he still here? \n[89]I don't believe I'm watching this. \n[90]Danger?... What do you mean? \n[91]In here? \n[92]It was real, Carl. She was real. \n[93]She was in touch with him. \n[94]Carl, she knew things. \n[95]I told you, the picture in Reno, the starfish,... damn it, Carl. She said Sam knew who killed him. That he was set up... murdered. \n[96]She had a name, an address -- Willie Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said he had Sam's wallet. \n[97]That's what I have to find out. \n[98]Sam wants me to go to the police. \n[99]You don't believe me. You don't believe any of this, do you? \n[100]You white fascist bigot. Who do you think you are? Bed Stuy's part of New York, you know. This is America. \n[101]Look, you've gotta believe me. I don't even believe this stuff, myself. But this is real. Do you think I'd come here if it wasn't real? You told me to come if I had any new information. Well, here I am. \n[102]Don't look at me like that. You guys use psychics all the time. \n[103]Damn it. I know how this sounds. I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe. But this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details. \n[104]Things Sam only said to me. \n[105]I'm telling you. The killer's name is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. You've got to check it out. \n[106]What are you doing? Where's your file on Willie Lopez? \n[107]This isn't possible. There were words, private things. How could she have known all that? \n[108]Ways? What ways? \n[109]No! She was real. She said things. She knew about a sweater I knitted, about songs we sang... She knew about this place we went, Montego Bay... \n[110]Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam. \n[111]Who's there? \n[112]Don't worry. It's okay. \n[113]Oh, that's so sweet. \n[114]Sure. \n[115]Are you alright? You look nervous, upset. \n[116]I didn't have time. I went to the police, Carl. \n[117]You were right, you know. I felt like such a fool. They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. It was awful. \n[118]The sad part is that I believed her. I believed her, Carl. It was all a sham. \n[119]Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe anything anymore. Why would people do such things? \n[120]I feel so alone. \n[121]Oh God, I don't know what's real anymore. I don't know what to think. \n[122]I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's too soon... You've been great Carl, but... I need you to leave. Please. I need you to. \n[123]Lionel? \n[124]Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady, about my height, did you see her? \n[125]What did she want? Did it have anything to do with me? Did she ask about Sam? \n[126]Was her name Oda Mae Brown? \n[127]No. I guess not. Thanks. \n[128]Carl? Where were you? I thought we were having...? \n[129]Forgot? I was worried. Is everything okay? Are you all right? \n[130]Why? What happened? \n[131]Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. I told you. It wasn't real. She's a charlatan. Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today? \n[132]I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says she was taking out money. It turns out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something. \n[133]What's wrong? \n[134]Sure. Just a second. What's going on? \n[135]Oh my God. Is that the gas? \n[136]Me, too. \n[137]Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it that woman, the psychic? \n[138]Carl, what's going on? Let me help you. \n[139]Carl, is that you? \n[140]Get the hell out of here. I'm calling the police. \n[141]No! \n[142]Why are you doing this to me? Get away from me! I know all about you. You're a fake. You're just a fake. Leave me alone! \n[143]grabbing hold of her beads. Her hand is shaking. \n[144]Go away! \n[145]Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. We're a red brick building with the entrance on the left side. Please hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be waiting right here. Police are on their way. \n[146]What do we do now? \n[147]Is Sam here? \n[148]Can you feel me, Sam? \n[149]Oh, Sam. \n[150]Sam! \n[151]I love you so much. \n[152]The police! \n[153]It's Carl! \n[154]This way! \n[155]God almighty, Carl! What are you doing? What have you done!? \n[156]Sam? Is that you? \n[157]I hear you, Sam. \n[158]Oh God! \n[159]Ditto. \n[160]See ya. ", "CARL": "\n[1]Sam, this may be none of my business, but I'm concerned you're doing too much coke. \n[2]How 'bout me? \n[3]I'll never wash again. \n[4]You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment. \n[5]What I wouldn't do for a place like this. \n[6]Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff. Three o'clock was the only time he could make it. Also, the board meeting in L.A. has been confirmed for the 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight. \n[7]Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain surgery you're going into. \n[8]Sam, you'll be fine. You're great with people. \n[9]Hey, nice. I like those. \n[10]Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa. That's the car I'm gonna drive when I'm making two hundred grand. \n[11]He said it was contagious. Very contagious. I shouldn't be going into work today. But what could I do? \n[12]Not good. It's spreading everywhere. \n[13]Everywhere. He said be sure not to touch anyone. \n[14]Hold on. \n[15]Sure. Just let me have your MAC code. \n[16]You bet. I'll do it right away. \n[17]Sam? Molly? Anybody home? \n[18]Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin? \n[19]Wow! The place looks great. Really great. \n[20]\"Like\" is hardly the word. I never imagined it would be this beautiful. This is incredible. \n[21]You? You weren't even a VP yet. \n[22]The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC code doesn't work. \n[23]Why? What's up? \n[24]Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going on. \n[25]Too much money. That's ridiculous. How could there be too much money? \n[26]It must be the computer. \n[27]Yeah, Mr. Fixit. Come on, move over. Let me see what I can do. \n[28]Okay, okay. Just call me when you're ready for help. So, what are you and Moll doing tonight? \n[29]It's hard. It's very hard. \n[30]Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I toss 'em? \n[31]Oh, you want to save those? \n[32]We all do. \n[33]Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know how that got in there. \n[34]Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's like summer outside. \n[35]Just for a stroll. It'd be good to get out. \n[36]Molly... you're not the one who died! \n[37]Thata girl. \n[38]Molly, there's no one on earth who'd like it to be true more than me, but you've got to be rational about this. I understand your desire to hold on to him, but this... this is absurd. \n[39]Molly, you're a grown woman. How can you believe some fortune teller from Brooklyn...? \n[40]I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a minute. \n[41]What kind of things? \n[42]Oh boy. This is getting deranged. We're going off the deep end here. \n[43]This is sick. This is really sick. How can you swallow this crap? Who knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's just setting someone up. \n[44]Find out? What are you talking about? \n[45]Sam wants you to go to the police? Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your mind? What are you gonna tell 'em? Some storefront psychic's been getting messages from the dead? Do you know how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts here, for God's sake. \n[46]I'm sorry. This stuff just really gets to me. \n[47]I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll make you sleep any better, I'll check it out, okay? Now why don't you go to bed. Try and get some sleep. \n[48]Who've you been talking to? \n[49]Some woman knows all about you. The murder, everything. Where's she getting it from, huh? \n[50]She knows your name, goddamn it! She knows where you live! \n[51]This isn't a joke, man. You find that bitch, whoever she is, and... get rid of her, you hear me? I've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer. If I don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, I'm dead. If I lose Balistrari's money, we're both dead. \n[52]What is wrong with you? Is everything a joke? You were supposed to steal his wallet. You weren't supposed to kill him. Was that a joke? \n[53]Jesus! These are drug dealers, man. Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've risked my job here. I could go to jail. A hundred thousand of that money goes to me. Now give me Sam's key. I'll get that address book myself. \n[54]God, let this be it! \n[55]Oh God, yes! \n[56]Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set. We're fine. Everything's fine. Just tell me what you want me to do. \n[57]Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be any problems. \n[58]Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up? \n[59]Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you. I felt bad about last night. This supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. I don't even read horoscopes. \n[60]No it's not. You needed me to hear you and I didn't and that was wrong. I want you to know that I'm your friend, Moll. \n[61]Hey, I brought you some Japanese apple pears. I know you like them. \n[62]Listen, can I come in for a minute? I won't stay long. I've had one of those days. Maybe a cup of coffee? \n[63]What can I tell you. It's been tough. Hell, you know. It still hurts so much. Then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. They've given me my own accounts, but I've had no time to adjust. My mind has been reeling. \n[64]Where were you this morning? I thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers. \n[65]You're kidding. You really did it? I don't believe... What did you tell them? What did they say? \n[66]A ripoff artist, huh? \n[67]Sometimes we need to believe. \n[68]It's hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold facts of it. What you have to remember is the love you felt. That's what's real. You have to remember how good Sam was. How much he loved you. \n[69]You were everything to him, Molly. You were his life. \n[70]You're not alone. You're young. You've got so much talent. You're fantastically gorgeous. \n[71]Just think about Sam. Think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were. \n[72]Let your feelings out. \n[73]Life turns on a dime, Moll. People think they have forever, that they'll always have tomorrow. But it's not true. Sam taught us that. We have to live for now, for today. \n[74]Sure. It's okay. I understand. I really do. \n[75]Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk. Can I interest you in that? \n[76]Hello. Carl Bruner speaking. \n[77]Mr. Balsitrari \n[78]Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll pick it up later. \n[79]Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. It's on the rolodex. \n[80]Is someone playing with the computers? \n[81]Is this a joke? One of my accounts is closed. \n[82]No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's all right. I can do it. \n[83]What the...? \n[84]Who's doing that? \n[85]Ah! \n[86]Jesus! Oh God! \n[87]I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. I completely forgot. \n[88]I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I talk to you for minute? Can I come in? \n[89]I need to ask you a question. \n[90]Molly, I know what the police said, but when you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you feel? What did he say? \n[91]Molly, that psychic woman, I want to know what she told you. I want to know what she said. \n[92]At the bank? \n[93]Stomach. My stomach. Do you have anything? Pepto Bismol. \n[94]What are you doing to me. Get away! Get away! \n[95]You touch me again and I'll set her on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her. I'll blow up the whole building if I have to. Stay away! \n[96]Go on, try it again. Let me see you turn it off now. \n[97]Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if you hurt me. \n[98]What's a matter? You believe me, huh? You better believe me! I want my money. I need that money and I want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that psychic lady doesn't bring it here, Molly's dead. \n[99]You must have left the stove on. \n[100]Just glad I smelled it. \n[101]Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go. Look, there's something going on. I can't talk now. Some trouble at the bank. \n[102]I don't have time to talk now. What if I come back? Around 11:00? \n[103]I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but it's important. I'll be back. \n[104]Eleven! \n[105]I'll check the building. \n[106]Look out! \n[107]Molly, open up. It's me. \n[108]Molly. Open up. Are you there? \n[109]Molly! \n[110]I want the check. Just give me the check. \n[111]Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's not her money. \n[112]Keep out of this, Molly! \n[113]Where is it? \n[114]Where? \n[115]Where is it, goddamn it? Where is it? \n[116]You're lying! Don't lie to me! \n[117]I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give me the check. \n[118]Sam, please. I didn't mean for him to kill you. It's not my fault. Come on, Sam, give me the check. Give it to me and I'll leave her alone. \n[119]Sam? Sam? \n[120]Sam? ", "ANGLE": "\n[1]The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off. \n[2]BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished. \n[3]Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly begins to count. \n[4]Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, float before us. A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that the light is enchanting him. The entire room begins to disappear in the light. Molly screams. \n[5]Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed. She is back on the street. To his amazement, he is on the street, too, still bathed in the soothing light. Frightened, he calls out to her. \n[6]Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks up and freezes. The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table. They are emitting a powerful light. \n[7]The light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam turns to the Old Man. \n[8]Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his chest, rocking aimlessly. Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes. Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to the air. \n[9]Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. Molly stands up. \n[10]Carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door. Suddenly Molly yells out. \n[11]The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back. Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND shudders up his spine. The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into the molecules of the wood. \n[12]Sam goes wild. He shoots at the man with all his might, attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. His hands and feet pass right through him. \n[13]Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for something but cannot find it. \n[14]on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling down on him. \n[15]on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching. Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane look. \n[16]Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing uncontrollably at the two of them. Unexpectedly his foot kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's sitting on an end table. The picture CRASHES to the floor, the glass SHATTERING. Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away. Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot goes right through it. Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears. \n[17]Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained teeth and seems perpetually unshaven. \n[18]A GROUP OF GHOSTS is milling behind Oda Mae. Sam comes barging into the room and looks at them in amazement. \n[19]Oda Mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet. One of the ghosts draws close. Oda Mae's eyes roll up into her head. Then, suddenly, an extraordinary thing occurs. We see the spirit pull back and dive right into Oda Mae. Oda Mae gulps. Her nostrils flare. Her eyes bulge. \n[20]He rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway is empty. As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie nearly jumps out of his skin. \n[21]A pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit Willie in the head. He freaks. Grabbing his gun, Willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself. Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees. \n[22]Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing in the crowd, turns and runs. \n[23]Oda Mae closes her eyes. \"Unchained Melody\" begins to play. Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly slides his ghostly body into her solid form. We sense Oda Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside her. After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly. Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures, touches Molly's hand. Molly swallows hard. She closes her eyes. \n[24]Sam. It is as though he alone is there with Molly. His eyes are full of tears. He can barely move. His hand glides slowly down Molly's cheek. He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and pain. The experience is more than he can bear. He pulls back. \n[25]A LOUD JARRING SOUND. It takes a moment to realize that it is someone KNOCKING at the door. The light slams back into its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his ghostly form. Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center of the room. Sam is beside them. He appears shaken and dizzy. There is a another loud POUNDING at the door. \n[26]Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with his fists. To his great shock, he has no impact. Carl walks right through him. \n[27]\n[28]With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is happening. \n[29]Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible longing. Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, silent moment. ", "WILLIE": "\n[1]Your wallet! \n[2]She came home. I couldn't get it. Give me a couple of days. I'll go back. \n[3]Carl, what're you doin' here? \n[4]Talking to? What the hell do you mean? What's going on? \n[5]What the hell are you talking about?
