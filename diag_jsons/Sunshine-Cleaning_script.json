Damn it Norah, my class starts in fifteen minutes. \n[3]I'm gonna be so late. \n[4]How can you eat that stuff? \n[5]He'll be hyper all night. \n[6]Be good. \n[7]And no lobsterman stories. He had nightmares all week. Just use some common sense. \n[8]You want me? \n[9]Still sore? \n[10]I don't know why you did that. \n[11]When was the last time you even played basketball? \n[12]I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him. \n[13]Norah and a cop? That would happen. \n[14]With the dead body there? \n[15]Sounds horrible. \n[16]You think that's all I can do? Clean other people's shit? \n[17]I am gonna be a real estate agent. \n[18]Why isn't he in bed? \n[19]It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad told me about you getting fired. \n[20]What happened? \n[21]What, were you stoned or something? \n[22]I thought you liked Mr. Kim. \n[23]When are you going to grow up and start taking responsibility for-- \n[24]Shut up and take the ten. \n[25]Any pie? \n[26]We're all finished. Since it's our first visit we did the blinds and appliances but normally we'll alternate those weekly. Nobody mentioned anything to us about laundry so we didn't bother with that but if you want laundry included there is an extra... \n[27]Paula Datzman. Wow. \n[28]How are you? \n[29]Congratulations. \n[30]I'm good. Really good! \n[31]Nope. No. I'm not sure...I think he ended up marrying Heather Volkman. \n[32]I... I've just gotten my real estate license, and so... \n[33]Yeah, this... this is just kind of a temporary thing and I'm about to just really phase over into the real estate full time. \n[34]Me? Um. You know, I haven't really decided yet. I might check out Long and Foster. \n[35]Yeah. Maybe. \n[36]Hello. \n[37]I did pay the damages for that. \n[38]Okay. What did he do this time? \n[39]Well I'm not putting him in special ed. I'll figure out a way to put him in private school before I do that. \n[40]Nobody dad, we're just talking. \n[41]Mac, it's me. \n[42]I know, I'm sorry. \n[43]I thought she had yoga on Saturdays. \n[44]I know, I'm sorry. I just needed to ask you... you know the other day... you said that... about the specialized cleaning guys making so much money... \n[45]Are you even listening? \n[46]What do you mean `no thanks'? What else do you have to do? You don't have a job. You don't go to school. What, are you going to live with Dad the rest of your life? \n[47]It's just until I get my real estate license. \n[48]Dad don't. \n[49]A while. \n[50]Found it. \n[51]Yeah. \n[52]Mac got us another gig. \n[53]I'll pick you up in an hour. \n[54]Money. \n[55]Apparently some crazy bag lady squatter person died and-- \n[56]I didn't know you wanted any. \n[57]All we have to do is go in and throw everything away. Cake. \n[58]Great, now we're gonna have to clean that up too. \n[59]Where are you going? \n[60]You said you would help me. \n[61]Dumpster? \n[62]That's none of your business, Norah. \n[63]Hand me that. \n[64]Mom was never like this. Mom would never have been like this. \n[65]Damnit Norah, we still have a lot of shit to do here. Are you just gonna talk? \n[66]It was so disgusting. I mean the smell, you would not believe. \n[67]There were flies everywhere and, really, the smell. I can't even describe it. \n[68]But, after we finished... you woulda never even known. We took all that away... made it right. \n[69]No, I-- \n[70]Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding. \n[71]Property easements, square footage, appliances... \n[72]Freak. \n[73]Curb appeal. \n[74]Why'd you pick her? \n[75]How was it like? \n[76]No. \n[77]No. \n[78]Winston? \n[79]I spoke with you on the phone. I'm Rose Lorkowski. \n[80]So, our situation is... \n[81]We're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult... \n[82]Really smelly job where the lady had died and they didn't find her for a while and it was really... \n[83]The odor was really strong. \n[84]Yeah, a decomp! \n[85]Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a hard one. I think I got lost in the white and gave up. \n[86]You like cats? \n[87]I asked him if he liked cats. \n[88]Hmm? \n[89]I didn't think he was creepy. \n[90]They think we're just a couple of hacks. \n[91]Why? \n[92]I'll drop Oscar by around seven. \n[93]Mortgage lenders and financing. \n[94]Hi. Could you tell me what time you have? Okay. Thanks. \n[95]I am strong. I am powerful. I am a winner. I'm a fucking idiot. \n[96]I'm quitting real estate. \n[97]Shut up. \n[98]Yeah. I'd like that. \n[99]Thought we'd put a positive spin on things. My son drew the design. \n[100]Oscar! \n[101]I was thinking maybe I could set a few out by the register? \n[102]So, marketing? Like...? \n[103]B.B. who? \n[104]Did you ask him to come. \n[105]I can handle it. \n[106]It's a real growth industry. \n[107]Can be. Can be. \n[108]We gotta take any contaminated materials to the incinerators. So we'll need lots of space back here. \n[109]So, how much is this? \n[110]Well, I could pay cash. \n[111]What? \n[112]I noticed the bumper's kind of banged up. \n[113]God, do people even use those anymore? \n[114]No. \n[115]Antenna's probably broke. \n[116]You should rent it. Seriously, you're making money now. \n[117]Oh please, Dad would survive just fine. You should do it. \n[118]What the hell? \n[119]You took the pictures? Why would you do that? We could get in a lot of trouble for that. \n[120]Rose- Rose Lorkowski. Nice to meet you. \n[121]We're hardly competition for you. \n[122]Well, we're not like that. I just have to complete this seminar and we're certified. \n[123]Not yet. Probably by the end of the month. \n[124]I think it's starting. \n[125]That makes total sense. Why didn't I think of that? \n[126]It's not how I thought it'd be. I thought it'd be gross. \n[127]Sometimes it's gross. The maggots are gross. The maggots kind of freak me. \n[128]The sound. The munching sound. \n[129]Tell me about it. You pour industrial bleach right on `em...nothing. \n[130]I am strong. I am powerful. \n[131]Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well, I'm glad you liked the Fancy Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah. \n[132]Okay... 2327 Grove Avenue. Got it... Sure. Yeah. Thank you. \n[133]A suicide! \n[134]Oh, man. \n[135]OK. Stay in the van. You want a soda or anything? \n[136]We won't be long. \n[137]Mrs. Davis? \n[138]We're the cleaning service. \n[139]No, no. I think we can find it. \n[140]Would you like to sit for a moment, Mrs. Davis? \n[141]Her husband died. \n[142]Maybe. \n[143]What are you talking about? \n[144]Oh honey, come here. \n[145]Sometimes your grampa promises things that he really wants to happen. \n[146]Okay. If you say so. \n[147]Legally, it's not really necessary. \n[148]We're in the process. \n[149]We adhere to all the proper procedures when dealing with a potentially hazardous situation. We are very professional. \n[150]Are you guys all finished? \n[151]Why don't you grab the wet-vac and I'll start bagging the loose stuff. \n[152]I did. I mean, I went to part of it. Most of it. \n[153]I got side tracked. \n[154]That Above and Beyond guy was there. Carl. We got talking shop and-- \n[155]I'm already registered for the next one. \n[156]I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. I just wanted to let you know that we're all finished up and-- \n[157]We can come back later if that's better. \n[158]I'm so sorry for your loss. \n[159]You want a Coke? \n[160]Dammit. \n[161]What did you guys do today? \n[162]How's it without Norah here? \n[163]Shit. \n[164]What are you doing here? \n[165]Oscar's asleep. \n[166]How's the baby? \n[167]They are. If we keep going at this rate I can hire a couple of employees soon, put a little more in marketing, give those Clean Sweep guys a run for their money. \n[168]I'm a business woman. \n[169]Oscar? \n[170]The blue or the flowery? \n[171]Good call. \n[172]Sunshine Cleaning. \n[173]State Farm? State Farm! Yes. Hello. \n[174]Yes! Hi. What can I do for you? \n[175]Great. No problem. \n[176]Shit, shit, shit. \n[177]Honey, call grampa. \n[178]I can't I... I RSVPed. \n[179]It's an insurance company. They could throw us a ton of work. This is our in. \n[180]I promise I'll come straight after the shower and help finish up. \n[181]Stay out here. \n[182]Because I said so. \n[183]Dad! \n[184]Dad! Daddy! \n[185]Damn it dad, you scared me. \n[186]God, dad what were you-- \n[187]I need you to watch Oscar. \n[188]What do you mean you can't? \n[189]I'm in a real bind here. \n[190]Thanks. \n[191]I was wondering if Oscar could hang out here for a little while. \n[192]I've got this baby shower to go to and Norah's working a job and my dad's incapacitated... Do you mind? \n[193]You're a lifesaver. \n[194]You like it? \n[195]All right. Be good. I'll pick him up in a few hours when I'm done. \n[196]Actually, I own my own business. \n[197]No. It's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. It's a growth niche industry right now \u00ad highly technical and competitive. \n[198]A lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. So, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. Make sure that the area is clean and sanitary. \n[199]People just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids. \n[200]Course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um... professional techniques. Like I said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know... methodology behind it. \n[201]Real growth industry. \n[202]Yeah. \n[203]I do. We come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. They've lost somebody. The circumstances are different but that's the same. \n[204]And we help them. In this one small way... we help. \n[205]Sorry. \n[206]Hello, you've reached Sunshine Cleaning. You're call is very important to us so... \n[207]You know what? I... uh...Actually, there's somewhere I need to be. \n[208]Yeah. Well... Yeah. \n[209]Oh my God, what have you done? \n[210]How does this happen? Huh? How do you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus fucking Christ! \n[211]This is on you. You did this. You set a fucking house on fire! You. \n[212]I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could handle a little bit of responsibility. \n[213]Well maybe if I didn't have to take care of everybody in this family. \n[214]Oh that's great. Turn everything to shit and then walk away. \n[215]Great. \n[216]I'm sorry, I... everything's horrible. \n[217]Norah's ruined everything. She burnt down a house. A client's house. \n[218]You know? \n[219]How does he...? \n[220]That's just great. We burnt down a client's house. How do you get around that? \n[221]I figured we'd wait and get the better rate once I got certified. \n[222]There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know. \n[223]Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at that. \n[224]And cheering. I was pretty good at that too. \n[225]Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd think. \n[226]You brush your teeth? \n[227]Long day. \n[228]It's not really a good time. \n[229]It's beautiful. \n[230]No, I like it very much. \n[231]It's just this thing we're doing. \n[232]I don't want this anymore. \n[233]Thanks. For everything. \n[234]We're going to Hinkle's Saturday for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great if you came. \n[235]Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks. \n[236]God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse. \n[237]I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job. \n[238]I know. I should have been there. \n[239]I got some ideas. I was thinking maybe we could-- \n[240]So, you really think he's hot? \n[241]What's that say? \n[242]Cool. \n[243]How? \n[244]I'm selling the van. \n[245]Have to. Can't afford the payment. \n[246]Turn your TV on. Channel sixty- five. \n[247]Hello? Mom? \n[248]Oscar turned eight today. We had this whole big thing at Hinkle's. Winston came. After dinner Oscar and Norah got a high score on Centipede and put in ASS as their initials and got in trouble by the manager. I don't know if you're in heaven or what. But you're not here and that's too bad for you `cuz you've missed out. You've missed out on some really great stuff. \n[249]Dad? \n[250]Okay. \n[251]What? \n[252]You lost the house. Oh my god, you lost the house. Dad how could you lose the house? \n[253]Not shrimp I hope. \n[254]Nineteen sixty-three? \n[255]Dad. \n[256]I can live with that. \n[257]Thank you. ", "NORAH": "\n[1]I so don't care. \n[2]Fuck. \n[3]The fact that we have sex, real coitus sex, means I'm under no obligation to blow you. \n[4]I'm not scared of it. \n[5]Dad, get the phone. \n[6]Hello. \n[7]I know, I know. \n[8]Sorry. \n[9]I brought fancy corn! \n[10]You're welcome. \n[11]He's slowly freezing to death and he knows lobsterman is out there... somewhere... coming for him. And he's totally screwed because his tongue is stuck to the mailbox. \n[12]I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes. \n[13]Are you gonna let me tell the story? \n[14]An then, he hears a horrible sound. Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag. Lobsterman is coming. \n[15]He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the skin off his tongue and make a run for it lobsterman will tear him to pieces with his razor sharp claws. \n[16]It's about time. I thought your class got over at 9:30. \n[17]Said he was scared. I think he was fakin' it though. \n[18]I'm not taking money. \n[19]Nothing. \n[20]It was just Mr. Kim being a dick head. \n[21]Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started working there. Now he's a full on gym teacher, I swear to God. \n[22]Oh please, you love it when I fuck up. Love it. Me screwing up gives you the hugest woody. \n[23]There was a diner scene earlier. With a waitress. \n[24]Completely pie free. \n[25]Rose, you buy generic cigarettes with couch change. How are you gonna pay for private school? \n[26]No thanks. \n[27]I don't think you're in any position to feel superior. \n[28]You are so out of touch. \n[29]Think they loved each other? \n[30]I'm sleeping. \n[31]What do you want? \n[32]I'm sleeping. \n[33]No. \n[34]You suck. \n[35]You still suck. \n[36]You didn't get me coffee? \n[37]Of course I... \n[38]How long is this gonna take? \n[39]There is no way. \n[40]Maybe if you'd gotten me a coffee. \n[41]I'm standing here. \n[42]What do we do with that? \n[43]It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away. \n[44]I bet this is her. \n[45]Wow, look at this. \n[46]Think it's her daughter? \n[47]Shouldn't we do something? Try to find her or something? \n[48]What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't you want to know if this was mom? \n[49]I wonder how she died? \n[50]Smelly. \n[51]Stinky. \n[52]Great. You freaked him out. \n[53]Turns out it's against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster. Who knew? \n[54]How perfect was he with the one arm? \n[55]The creepy guy. Do you think he was born like that? \n[56]Dude, he has one arm. \n[57]We are a couple of hacks. \n[58]Stop here. \n[59]I gotta thing. Just drop me off here. \n[60]You have class tonight? \n[61]Heather's pregnant again. Did you know that? He's never going to leave her. \n[62]God, you're pathetic. \n[63]What? \n[64]I'm not following you. \n[65]What? \n[66]That's all right. \n[67]No. No I don't. \n[68]It was a mistake. No big deal. \n[69]Let's press the alarm button. \n[70]Me? No. \n[71]Hobby... \n[72]There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla. \n[73]KoKo. \n[74]Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken. \n[75]That's what's so cool about it. \n[76]No, don't... it's fine. \n[77]Not exactly. \n[78]Oh, excellent. \n[79]Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive? \n[80]Ice Cream Hut! \n[81]How cool to live across from the Ice Cream Hut. \n[82]Yeah well, what about Dad? \n[83]Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter. Don't you teach this kid anything? \n[84]Yeah. \n[85]My sister. \n[86]Had I known about the juice boxes... \n[87]I just wanted to give her the pictures. \n[88]Relax, I didn't give them to her. \n[89]It's just three blocks away. \n[90]It's not like I'm never gonna see you. \n[91]It just means your mom wasn't married when she had you. It's no big deal. In a couple of years you're gonna find it's a free pass to cool. You'll probably start a band called Bastard Son. Use it to impress the chicks. Trust me, the whole bastard thing... it's working for you. \n[92]What was that? \n[93]She okay? \n[94]You made it seem so fun. \n[95]Oh my God, is that the needle? It's a fucking cocktail straw. \n[96]You might have oversold it. \n[97]Feels hot. \n[98]My friend's having a thing tonight. \n[99]Never mind. \n[100]Nothing it's... \n[101]You wouldn't like it. \n[102]I knew you wouldn't have any fun here. \n[103]Lambs breath. \n[104]Straight edge? \n[105]She's Mormon. \n[106]What? \n[107]You don't drink? \n[108]All right, you're kind of freakin me out. \n[109]You should just tell people you're Mormon. \n[110]Yes. Yes, he is. \n[111]I need more beer. \n[112]Um. Can I get you anything? \n[113]Shh. \n[114]Hello. \n[115]Yeah, I'm watching it now. \n[116]We are. \n[117]You went to that thing. \n[118]Wait. I thought you went to that thing. \n[119]I thought you went to the thing. \n[120]What do you mean you went to part of it? It was a one day thing. \n[121]Side tracked? \n[122]Oh my God, you humped Carl! \n[123]That's disgusting. \n[124]Sure. \n[125]On so many levels. \n[126]Listen, Randy I think we should stop hanging out. \n[127]Yeah, I don't. I should, but I don't. And you're a really great guy. But...I don't care if you have sex with the rabbit lady... and I mean, it seems like I should care about that. \n[128]Ever been trestling? \n[129]No. The person is gone. It's weird `cuz we're connected to them in this strangely intimate way... but we never actually meet them. It's just kind of weird. \n[130]I have seen a dead body once though. \n[131]My mom. \n[132]She was in a movie of the week once, ya know. \n[133]A bunch of Hollywood people were filming down in Old Town. They thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part. You want to hear it? \n[134]`I recommend the pecan pie.' \n[135]That was her line. It was on TV and everything. \n[136]Me and Rose, we didn't actually see it but Rose says mom talked about it all the time. I don't remember. \n[137]I don't remember her much at all. I have this box of her stuff though, little things she touched. When it seems like she never even really existed... it's proof. \n[138]All right. This is where we climb. \n[139]Up to that girder. \n[140]Best place to be when it comes. \n[141]You're gonna miss the best part. \n[142]It's like... it's like this big pissed off God up in your face just screaming at you. So close you can smell the metal on his breath. \n[143]It is. I'm telling you. \n[144]I didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff. I just thought you would... I don't know, I guess I thought... \n[145]He's coming. \n[146]Rose, wait for me. \n[147]Sneaky fucker. \n[148]I think I broke my hand. \n[149]No. But it hurts like a mother. \n[150]Ow! \n[151]I just... I found them. I was gonna tell you. \n[152]At work. \n[153]We did this job a while back. This woman... \n[154]I wanted to tell you... that first day. That's why I-- \n[155]I think... You know, I think there's a reason that I found them. The pictures. Because that lead me to you, right? \n[156]And I don't know exactly what went on between you and your mom... what the situation was... but it just seems like... You know, of anybody, I would understand. \n[157]Wait. Please. Don't...I-- \n[158]Blow off the shower. \n[159]So tell him we can't do it. \n[160]So, don't go to the damn baby shower. It's not like you ever even liked Paula. \n[161]Shit. \n[162]Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind? \n[163]It's okay. \n[164]No, no, no. \n[165]\n[166]It was an accident. \n[167]It was an accident. \n[168]Jesus Rose, Calm down. \n[169]Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter. Prove to your old cheerleading squad that you're not this huge loser. If you had been here doing your job it wouldn't have happened. So don't try to put all this on me. \n[170]Oh, go ahead and play the martyr. It's like your favorite thing. \n[171]I am   so sick of all your holier than   thou bullshit. Why don't you take   a look at you're own life, huh?   You're a real inspiration. \n[172]Fuck you. I'm done being your excuse. \n[173]No. \n[174]I need to talk to Lynn. \n[175]Why are you acting like this? Why haven't you called me back. \n[176]What's that supposed to mean? \n[177]Here. \n[178]Sorry I'm late. \n[179]Hey. \n[180]Winston cleans up pretty good. \n[181]I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that. So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot. \n[182]Listen, I know I fucked up, okay?
