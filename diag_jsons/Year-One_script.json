{"dialogues": {"ZED": "\n[1]What? \n[2]\n[3]Orange? Tangerine?  Umm, mango? Kiwi? Peach? She shakes her head coyly. He starts darting from tree to tree, hopefully pointing out various options. She follows him.     Official White                                                      3. \n[4]Plum? Nectarine? Passion fruit? \n[5]Okay, don't tell me-- papaya? Pomegranate? Lemon? Lime? Kumquat? Uh, cock? Cockfruit? \n[6]Watermelon? Honeydew? Grapes? \n[7]Starfruit, casaba-- tangelo? \n[8]\n[9]Yeah, right. Okay. \n[10]Because that's the fruit we don't eat! It's forbidden. \n[11]Because we don't! It's a rule! That's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. You don't eat from that one. Nobody ever has. \n[12]Stop saying why not! I told you-- it's a rule. \n[13]No-- yeah-- I don't know. We don't have that many rules. In fact, we only have one rule-- DON'T EAT THAT \n[14]I'm not \"afraid\"-- \n[15]Okay! Fine! You want to try the Good and Evil fruit, you got it. He rips two ripe fruits from a low-hanging bough and hands her one. They both stare at the fruit. \n[16]No way! It was your idea. You go first. \n[17]Okay. Ready? One-- two-- three! Zed chomps down hard and takes a big bite, but Maya fakes him out and stops before her teeth break the skin. \n[18]Got me. That's a good move. I'm going to steal it. He starts chewing and she watches as he gets his first taste of Good and Evil. Then his face contorts in disgust and he spits it out. \n[19]Yuchh! That's horrible. Yecch, ptui! Ughh. He frantically wipes the inside of his mouth with his fingers, trying to get the terrible taste out. \n[20]Yes! I'm saying it's not good! He grabs his belly as his stomach starts to cramp. Then a loud bowel sound and his eyebrows shoot up. \n[21]Oh, no--     Official White He runs for the bushes. Maya's attention gets diverted. \n[22]Do me a favor. Just kill me. \n[23]I couldn't help myself! Maya was just staring at me with those pouty eyes-- and those perky breasts-- opposable thumbs. And how about the name? \"The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil\"? You don't think that sounds tempting? They should've just called it \"The Tree with the Fruit that Tastes Like Shit.\" Then for sure nobody would eat it. Zed notices a VILLAGER squatting in the bushes right behind his dwelling. \n[24]Hey! Squanto! Give me a break, would ya'! You got the whole forest!  Why does everyone have to crap right behind my hut? \n[25]I don't see it. I mean she's cute, but I don't think I'd lay with her. \n[26]which was a big mistake. I see that now. You think it won't be awkward the next morning but-- trust me, you just want to rip your eyeballs out.  Listen, if you want to impress Eema, tonight at the feast, do the fertility dance with her, then drag her back to your hut. \n[27]So you give her a little tap on the head. Women respond to that-- \n[28]I wouldn't read too much into that. She kisses, then tongues the spear tip. \n[29]Okay, that might mean something. The hunter Marlak walks by and stops. He's clearly half a rung lower on the human evolutionary scale.     Official White                                                             9. \n[30]Yes, Marlak. Very observant. I was indisposed. Got that intestinal thing that's been going around. Marlak grunts and examines the primitive line drawings on the walls of Zed's hut. \n[31]It's a bear. \n[32]It's not a real bear. It's a \"representation\" of a bear. You know, a \"picture.\" \n[33]Yeah. Like you'd know. \n[34]That-- would be an antelope-- or a deer-- a deerpalope. \n[35]How could it be Maya? It's just some lines on a skin. \n[36]Your woman? I'm not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual \"thing\" going. Marlak cuffs him hard on the side of the head. \n[37]Hey! Nice supra-orbital ridge, fartface! \n[38]Hey, Oh? Did it ever occur to you that there may be more to life than this? \n[39]No,                                                            I'm serious.We're born into thisworld, we hunt, we gather, we eat,we sleep, we make babies-- \n[40]--but why? What's the point? \n[41]No. Last night I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there looking up at the sky, counting the stars. There were over seventy. Kinda makes you think, doesn't it? \n[42]Really? I've been thinking about it ever since I ate that fruit. Don't you ever wonder what's on the other side of the mountains? \n[43]But what if it doesn't? What if it just goes on and on forever? Or what if it's round? (he picks up a round \n[44]Sorry! \n[45]Do it, man! Go dance for her. \n[46]Are you kidding? Go! Jackal Dance! Oh summons his courage, gets up and crosses to where the girls are sitting. Zed makes subtle eye contact with Maya, waggles his eyebrows and licks his lips. She laughs and looks away. Oh starts dancing timidly right in front of Eema, subtly jerking his pelvis, trying to be cool. Eema just stares at him for a moment, then goes back to talking to her friends. Oh looks over at Zed for help. Zed mimes clonking her on the head. Oh picks up a wooden club and hits Eema right on the noggin. However, instead of submitting, she gets really pissed, stands up and decks him with one punch.     Official White                                                                             13. Eema glowers at Zed who feigns innocence. \n[47]Excuse me, hunter coming through. \n[48]For your information I was in line and I just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady. Suddenly a SPEAR is thrust inches from his face, stopping him. It's Marlak, who towers over Zed. His cohort, ENMEBARAGESI, short and stout, stands beside him. \n[49]Oh, really? And what if I called Enmebaragesi a liar? \n[50]Calm down. I said \"what                                     if\"-- it was a hypothetical. Marlak gets right in Zed's face. \n[51]No, you just made it harder on myself!  Okay, fine, you got me. (gingerly moves the spear \n[52]Isn't that what we're talking about? Maya rolls her eyes. \n[53]Oh, that! Yeah! I did eat the fruit. I was just kidding about humping Maya. Marlak knocks Zed to the ground. The DRUMMING stops. Oh comes running over and gets between Marlak and Zed. \n[54]Look, Marlak, this is crazy. You're two of me. I'm not gonna fight you over a girl, okay? Zed starts to walk away but quickly pivots and throws a WILD HAYMAKER at Marlak who easily ducks it, and it hits an unsuspecting Enmebaragesi squarely in the nose. Zed  And let that be a lesson to your big friend- Marlak grabs Zed, lands two solid punches to Zed's mid- section, and then clocks him with a vicious right that sends him sprawling to the ground. \n[55]One bite! What's the big deal? \n[56]I've always had trouble with the Great Turtle Theory-- too many unexplained gaps. \n[57]Really? How screwed? Like I knew it was a rule but I'm a little fuzzy on the exact details. \n[58]Where am I supposed to go? \n[59]Oh, really?      \n[60]Am I detecting a little jealousy here because I now have the knowledge of good and evil and you don't? Well, you know what? I say what I did was a good thing-- a very very good thing-- and I'm not leaving. What do you think of that? A HUMAN SKULL comes flying in from off-camera and lands at his feet. \n[61]Okay, is that supposed to be funny? He stands up and we see that the whole tribe is standing around them in a wide circle. Marlak bangs his spear on the edge of his animal-hide shield, starting a rhythmical beat. The other hunters join in, keeping the beat, staring at Zed with lethal intent \n[62]I don't want to seem ungrateful or anything, but you wouldn't happen to have any arrows, would you? An arrow zips in and sticks in the post next to his head. \n[63]Okay, but before I go I just want to say something. I know I'm not the greatest hunter--     Official White                                                             18. \n[64]Yes, or gatherer-- but there's got to be more to life than this--  Kinda hard to concentrate with that rhythmic drumming, fellas. The Hunters keep the insistent beat, their gaze fixed on Zed. \n[65]Anyways, I'm going away, not because you're forcing me to-- which you are-- but because I choose to. Yes, I ate from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil-- major misunderstanding on my part-- and believe me I'm not recommending it unless you're interested in a very powerful laxative-- but it got me thinking about some pretty heavy stuff -- life questions, you know. So I'm out of here, and anyone who wants to join me is welcome. He looks around the circle and sees Maya. She sees Marlak staring at her and averts her eyes. \n[66]\n[67]I don't know where we're going or when we're going to get there, but I will lead the way-- (he picks up a burning \n[68]Okay, then I guess I'll just have to go it alone, which is fine with \n[69]Oops! They all stare as the fire quickly leaps from roof to roof. \n[70]I know there's a lesson in here somewhere. Any thoughts? The villagers scream and run off to try and save their huts. It's chaos. \n[71]No, you don't. \n[72]How can you see me if I'm not here? \n[73]Okay, then tell me this-- who's standing right behind you? \n[74]Was it my speech? \n[75]But the speech was pretty good, right? I mean, even I was moved and I was the one speaking. \n[76]This is nice, out here, the two of us. \n[77]Come on, those hunters are idiots. In an hour they'll forget the whole thing. \n[78]You know what we should do? You and me should kill the biggest boar ever-- just huge!-- and take it back to the village. Just to show them. And we won't let anyone else eat it. They'll have to watch us eat it. \n[79]Fine, we'll just start with something small. A squirrel or something.     Official White                                                            22. \n[80]Yeah, like it's so hard to build a new hut. It's just a pile of sticks and dung-- \n[81]Oh! \n[82]Don't move a muscle. \n[83]I don't know. There's two different opinions on this one. Some say run, some say don't. \n[84]I'm going to-- RUN! He sprints off and the cougar pounces right on oh. \n[85]You really should put some maggots on those scratches. They look pretty deep. \n[86]Because I honestly thought he'd go for me. I thought I was doing you a favor. Apparently not appreciated. \n[87]You didn't have to come with me, you know. I didn't ask you to come. \n[88]Yes, that's a technique of public speaking, but I didn't ask you specifically. You chose to come. You gotta take some responsibility for that. And there's no point coming if you're just gonna keep whining about every little-- cougar that attacks you. (pulls the cooked rodent from the fire You want some or not?     Official White                                                                          24. \n[89]You making your own fire? \n[90]You're still coming? \n[91]I knew it! Still think you're just gonna fall off the edge of the world?     Official White                                                                25. \n[92]Oooh.                                                           -  I'll go around! Wait for me! \n[93]Say what you want, but that was no accident. You don't see a pattern here? \n[94]Yeah, but why? Why'd the cougar go for you and not me? Why did you fall and I didn't? Hard to believe it's all just random. Think about \n[95]People-- more than one-- walking-- that way. \n[96]Yes! There! He drops to one knee and examines something in the bushes. Zed They stopped here to poop. Look. \n[97]Four men, maybe five. And a child-- or a small women maybe. \n[98]Looks like they had some nuts-- dried fruit-- some kind of green leafy vegetable-- \n[99]This one's mine. He takes his bow, pulls an arrow from his quiver, and slowly draws the bow, taking deadly aim at one of the cows. He shoots. The blunt, pointless arrow hits the cow in the side and bounces off. The cow looks up.     \n[100]We're gonna need some arrowheads. Zed draws his flint knife, then suddenly bursts out of the forest, dashes toward the cow and leaps on its back. Oh comes running up as the cow bucks and sends Zed flying. Lying on the ground, Zed looks up and sees TWO SURPRISED YOUNG FARMERS dressed in simple white woolen tunics staring at him. \n[101]\n[102]What do you guys do? \n[103]Hey! Easy! \n[104]Okay, boys, that's enough. We just want to-- \n[105]We're not really that insulted-- \n[106]Boys, boys! You're brothers! Let's just relax and-- Cain uses the distraction to sneak-punch Abel and the fight is on. They start throwing wild punches, then clinch and wrestle each other to the ground. \n[107]Just let them settle it. Cain picks up a good-size rock and strikes Abel on the head with all his might. Abel falls heavily to the ground and lies there, not moving. Cain stands over him, breathing hard. \n[108]I guess that settles it. \n[109]Nothing! Cain stares at Abel, still inert on the ground. \n[110]Hey! What do you mean \"we\"? I don't want to play the blame game, but you're the one who hit him. \n[111]We didn't know you were going to kill him-- \n[112]Did I say that? \n[113]Why even bring it up? \n[114]Unfortunately we already have dinner plans. \n[115]What are the big round things for? \n[116]Wow! That is like the greatest invention since the vagina. Cain whips the oxen and they lumber forward. Oh screams as the HEAVY WHEELS ROLL OVER HIS FEET. \n[117]Thanks, but I'm kind of staying away from fruit for the time being. Zed gives Cain a subtle, acquiescent nod as Adam ushers them into his crude dwelling.     Official White 17 \n[118]Yeah, that's got to be pretty vexing. A Bergmanesque gloom fills the hovel as Adam muses sullenly on his sorry circumstances. \n[119]Wow. That's kind of a downer isn't it? \n[120]Boy, I hope not. \n[121]I'm waiting for the punchline. \n[122]Yeah, there you go.  Oh looks at Seth. \n[123]And that's a good way to be. In fact, I'm kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway. I would've thought guys would be lined up at the door. \n[124]Maybe you just haven't met the right one. \n[125]So we have that in common-- \n[126]I don't even know what that means. What does that mean? \n[127]\n[128]Why would they blame us? \n[129]Look at all these people! And this stuff! Oh approaches a bakery stand and stares hungrily at the bread. \n[130]Yeah, we're gonna need money.  What's money? They see a crowd at the center of the market gathered around a raised platform. SLAVES IN SHACKLES are lined up on the raised wooden platform while CUSTOMERS examine those waiting to be auctioned. The AUCTIONEER brings up a fnuscular male slave in a loincloth. \n[131]It's Marlak! Marlak's hands are bound and he's restrained by a chain attached to a thick leather collar around his neck. \n[132]Eema! Maya! The women embrace him with relief and excitement. \n[133]What happened? How did you get here?     Official white                                                             42. \n[134]Yeah, this one looks pretty good-- He starts prodding, poking and squeezing Maya's arm like he's buying fruit. Oh takes the opportunity to fondle Eema's breasts. She punches him. Zed Ooh, feisty! So how does this work if we want them? The slave trader notes Zed's peasant clothes. \n[135]Well, that depends on what you mean by money? \n[136]You still think it's all just a coincidence?                                                All of us here right now, at this particular place, at this particular time? \n[137]I'm not sure yet, but I'm starting to believe that everything happens for a reason. Like, why did I eat the forbidden fruit? \n[138]Official White                                   44. Okay, that might have been what I was thinking at the time, but what if some omnipotent force put the fruit there because I was supposed to eat it? \n[139]What do you mean \"which\" omnipotent force? How many omnipotent forces could there be? \n[140]Work with me-- I'm just speculating here. Let's call this force \"God\"; and let's say this \"God\" is controlling everything. Maybe God wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil. \n[141]Don't you get what I'm saying? What if we've been chosen? \n[142]Well, no offense, but it's possible that I was chosen and you all just happened to be there. \n[143]A chosen doesn't need to be strong. I'm big this way.  \n[144]Not my face, my brain. It's enormous. I'm the smartest guy in the village. \n[145]What?!  Which one of us is smarter? \n[146]Oh yeah, then why are we free and you're chained up? \n[147]Sit tight. I'm going to get you out of here. Do you trust me? \n[148]Fair enough. She gives him an encouraging hug, then Zed and Oh cross to Cain and the slave trader.     Official White                                                                                      46. \n[149]Good work. What's the deal? The slave owner smiles. \n[150]I never trusted that guy. \n[151]It's not like I want to be a slave or anything, but this is embarrassing!     Official white                                                                                 47. \n[152]Come on, people! We're a steal at thirty! \n[153]Hey, pal! You can take your foot out of my ass anytime now.  And your foot is still there. If I turn around, you will be sorry. Zed twists violently and manages a full turn which brings him face to face and crotch to crotch with Maya. \n[154]That's better. \n[155]Look, I want you to know I blame myself for everything that happened. \n[156]I don't think that's going to be possible. And I told you before, she's not \"your woman.\" \n[157]Ecchhh! Oh is vaguely aware of the fight going on but can't move. \n[158]I'd like to see you try. The Bedouin is just about to respond when suddenly A METAL TIPPED ARROW FLIES IN AND PIERCES HIS THROAT. He drops to the sand, dead.     Official White                                                                    50. \n[159]I wonder who they are. Their hats are really great, aren't they? \n[160]It wasn't my very first thought, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't up there.  Now we just need to figure out a way to rescue Maya and Eema. \n[161]Patience, my friend. Even killers have to sleep sometime. He keeps a sharp, wakeful eye on the enemy camp. \n[162]Well, that was refreshing. How'd you sleep? \n[163]Shit! He leaps to his feet, looks around desperately, and sees nothing but a vast wasteland in every direction. \n[164]I have no idea. \n[165]Will you stop being so negative? I got your back, man. Who saved you from those lions when you were a baby? They were going to pounce, had you surrounded. Took the mama lion-- BAM!-- kneed her right in the face. Papa lion comes flying at me-- BAM!-- dropped an elbow, knocked his ass out.      \n[166]Took his legs-- THWOOM!-- tossed him in the river. And the rest just ran off. \n[167]Yeah, because nobody else was there. You're lucky I was walking by.  Okay, it's possible I dreamed that-- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons? Not a dignified death. \n[168]We've got to keep moving.  I've got you, buddy-- just like always. He puts Oh over his shoulder and stumbles on. \n[169]\n[170]What are you doing to that kid? \n[171]What do you mean, nothing? You were just going to kill him! \n[172]Not to him, I'm guessing. Isaac nods gratefully. \n[173]What do you think? \n[174]Whatever you just said. Oh helps Isaac off the altar stone and unties him. \n[175]I am Zed and this is Oh, sons of-- people you wouldn't know.     Official White                                                                                56. \n[176]Sodom and Gomorrah? Never been there. But I've heard of them. \n[177]i didn't know that. What kind of abomination are we talking about? \n[178]Abominable. \n[179]Really. Tell me more. \n[180]We just want to know so we can avoid them. \n[181]When do you think all this smiting is going to go down? We may have some friends there. \n[182]Abraham, I'm a little worried about the city being destroyed. \n[183]This is all your land? \n[184]His name is praise and love his whole graciousness-- \n[185]I'm not sure I have any extra. \n[186]You know, Abe, it's late, and we've all had a lot to drink, and I know this whole foreskin thing sounds like a good idea now, but you may just want to sleep on it. we could always cut 'em off in the morning, but if we do it now, there's just no putting it back on later. \n[187]To the city. I have to find Maya. \n[188]And you're going to listen to him? You think he's more chosen than me? \n[189]Yes, and he also wanted to give his dick a little trim. \n[190]You don't even know where we're going. \n[191]No. Your dad specifically said Sodom and Gomorrah were evil. \n[192]No! I told you, that's not where we're going. \n[193]Fine. They stand there for less than a beat. \n[194]Okay, you win. Take us to Sodom. Isaac takes a couple of steps to the top of a rise and points off in the distance. \n[195]I knew it was right around here. \n[196]You shouldn't be smoking either. \n[197]Where? Back to the penis-cutter? Besides, Eema and Maya might be in there. You want to get them out before the city's destroyed, don't you? Isaac impatiently grabs a big rock and starts banging on the door. \n[198]Get help! Tell your father! \n[199]I kinda get why his dad wanted to kill him. The sentries drag them through a small door cut into a corner of the city gates. \n[200]We're not really Hebrews-- The guard smacks him in the mouth. \n[201]Okay. Lesson learned. No talking. \n[202]Hey! Why don't you pick on someone your own size? The sergeant drops Oh and turns to Zed. \n[203]Which would be difficult since there are probably very few people around who actually are your size-- He smacks Zed hard on the side of the head.     Official White                                                                                   66. \n[204]Relatively fat one. I wouldn't be talking about fat, if I were you. Another blow from the sergeant. \n[205]Right. Enough said. The sergeant rips open Zed's shirt exposing his back, then steps up behind Oh and does the same. A guard hands him a lethal-looking bat studded with sharp spikes. \n[206]All right, honestly? You did sell us into slavery. \n[207]That was way less than a fortnight. Half a fortnight, maybe. \n[208]Check out that woman across the street! She's looking at us. The prostitute smiles at them as she sensuously peels a banana, then slides the whole thing unbroken into her mouth. \n[209]This is great! How do I look? \n[210]So is this it? We just walk around? \n[211]What kind of trouble? \n[212]Pretty harsh, isn't it? \n[213]Did you see that girl? I think she liked me! She looked right at me. \n[214]Who was she? \n[215]Why not? \n[216]Will she be there? \n[217]Hey, there she is! He starts edging toward the royal pavilion. 45 \n[218]He makes his way to a position just below the royal pavilion and stares up at the Princess Inanna. She sees him looking at her but pretends not to notice.     Official white                                                           75. \n[219]What's happening? \n[220]What do they want a virgin for? \n[221]Why? \n[222]Seems like a waste of a perfectly good virgin to me.     Official white                                                             77. \n[223]This is just crazy. Maya approaches them but Zed and Oh still don't recognize her. \n[224]Me? Cool.  We're kind of a package deal. Can he come with? \n[225]I'll try to put in a good word for you. Cain fumes as Zed and Oh head off with Maya. \n[226]What do you think, ponytail or no ponytail? You know what?      \n[227]I'll start with the ponytail, see where the night takes me. Maya rolls her eyes and leads Zed to the entrance of the Great Hall. Cain and another guard are posted at the door. \n[228]Hey, you made it! What's it like inside? \n[229]Look, first of all, we're not actually brothers--- \n[230]Hey! You didn't let me finish. As soon as I get in there I'm going to talk to somebody and get you invited, okay? \n[231]Feels like a hair-down kinda scene, don't you think?     Official White                                                          83. \n[232]Maya?! What are you doing here? \n[233]I was going to rescue you! Really! In fact, we came here to find you. \n[234]This wasn't my idea, you know. \n[235]Hey! You're a real girl! That is so cool.     Official White                                                             84. He moves down the row of living sculptures, mugging at them, mock humping, and waving his hands in their faces trying to make them move, but they remain frozen. \n[236]Amazing! He comes to the LAST STATUE and does a double-take. This one is wearing only a skimpy cloth diaper and is posed like someone waiting for a bus. He is also painted gold, but unlike the others, he has a little potbelly and round shoulders, and can't seem to hold still for very long, shifting his weight uncomfortably and looking around in obvious embarrassment. \n[237]Oh? Oh looks down from his pedestal. \n[238]Yeah, you look so-- gold. How's it going? \n[239]Not bad. Had a little rub and a scrub, now I'm up for some grub. \n[240]Hey! You'll never guess who's here- - Maya! She's working here-- and she looks great! But she's kinda mad at me. Oh scans the great hall looking for her and spots Zed's sister Eema, his crush, come into the room carrying a tray of food.     Official White                                                           85. \n[241]You! Slave girl! (he pulls her away from \n[242]Now go-- fetch! Wait by that-- skinny statue. I'll deal with you later. As Eema exits, Zed turns to the officers and shrugs. \n[243]Slaves-- what are you gonna do? \n[244]Ouch. Helpful hint. I will keep that in mind.     Official White                                                          86. Zed bows, then leaves him and joins Eema who is waiting at Oh's pedestal. Zed What are you doing here? \n[245]Keep that up and you will. \n[246]Okay, I know what you're thinking, but I'm just checking it out. We kept hearing that this place was so evil, but now that I look around I'm thinking maybe it's not all bad. There's a lot to learn here. \n[247]No! Like the wheel, for instance! That's pretty awesome-- the way it just goes around in a circle. And farming! And metal-- writing, money, pottery-- hot baths. Come on! Back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough. \n[248]Look, I think I've been chosen to do something great with my life-- \n[249]--and I don't think it's hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets. Maya returns for Zed. \n[250]I hope you don't think I'm interested in her. \n[251]I'm just using her, Maya! It's part of my plan. I'm going to get you all out of here as soon as I can. \n[252]It's a secret. \n[253]And I await her.  You two await me. (then confidentially to Eema and Oh Stay out of trouble. I'll be back. He exits with Maya. \n[254]\n[255]I didn't know it was so close. \n[256]Looks pretty from up here, but some people think God is going to wipe them out because they're so evil. \n[257]I don't really know you. But you don't look evil. \n[258]Well, yeah. I think you're-- incredible. \n[259]No, you're perfect. Your face, your hair--  Your eyes are like the sea. \n[260]Well, it's kinda dark. I took a shot. I know they're big, though-- and wet-- She pulls him close. \n[261]Can I ask you one thing? What would a girl like you want with a guy like me?     Official white                                                    92. \n[262]\n[263]That's exactly what I've been thinking! You wouldn't believe the things that have been happening to me lately. I just didn't know why. \n[264]I couldn't agree more. I'm trying to agree more, but I can't. That's how much I agree. \n[265]What are we doing here? \n[266]Yes! Finally. Now you're talking! Should I enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom? Does the Holy of Holies like to be entered from behind or--? \n[267]The Gods are in there? \n[268]Then why am I going in? \n[269]\n[270]Right-- right. Then again, if the rules say-- \n[271]What is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules? You-all have this bad boy complex---- She kisses him fiercely on the lips. \n[272]I'm going in. He enters the Holy of Holies. A FIGURE darts between the columns and hides in the shadows. A beam of moonlight reveals the mark of Cain on his forehead. \n[273]Thank you, O-- Merciful ones, for-- not like-- killing me, and letting me receive the, uh, blessing of your holy-- godliness. He exhales and closes his eyes again, waiting for some divine response. Nothing comes.     Official White                                               97. \n[274]\n[275]Look, I know you think this place is evil and it kinda is-- I see that-- but that's not everybody. There are a lot of good people, too. So what if there were, like, fifty really good people? Would you still destroy the city?  Okay, you're right, that may be a reach. How about twenty? I could probably get you twenty extremely good people if I really looked around.  How about five? Five awesome people-- including myself. I personally know at least five people worth saving. Does that sound good?      Official White                                                                               98. \n[276]Hello? A little help? Am I getting warm here? Okay, is it me? Are you punishing me for stuff I did?  Or setting me up for what I need to do. Or both! Or neither?  Could you give me some kind of a sign-- please-- anything? Zed listens but hears only a profound silence. Then a revelation. He sits up on the floor. \n[277]Okay, wait. Is that the sign? The silence? Is that it?  It is, isn't it! Just this really silent-- silence.  You're not going to tell me what to do; it's up to me to decide what's right and what's wrong-- right? Is that it? You're not going to speak to me-- you're going to speak through me? If that's right, don't say anything.  Okay, I read you loud and clear. Thank you.  Oh, and if things don't work out with Maya would it be okay with you if me and the Princess had a little \"carnal knowledge\"? Not in an evil way or anything--  Okay! You're right, probably not a good idea. Thank you. He backs out of the Holy of Holies, bowing all the way. \n[278]I was just looking for the bathroom. \n[279]I wish I was upside down. Looks fun. Oh won't talk to him. \n[280]So this is it? We're not friends anymore? After all I've done for you?     Official White                                                           100. \n[281]I've helped you come out of your shell. \n[282]Listen, I know I'm not perfect, and I may have made a few wrong turns, but you have to understand-- I'm a chosen. That's a lot of responsibility -- you can't even imagine. \n[283]Okay, be mad, but I'm going to get us out of here, if it's the last thing I do. Zed starts frantically yanking on his shackles to no avail. \n[284]That was just my first idea-- and I'm also accepting ideas. \n[285]Oh, come on! \n[286]I just want to say this is really messed up-- \n[287]Can I make a suggestion? \n[288]Why don't you just pick one person to throw? The crowd thinks that's not a bad idea and murmurs agreement. \n[289]In fact, don't you think it would be fair for us to get to pick the person who stones us? Cain looks doubtful, but the crowd thinks this is eminently fair. \n[290]We pick him! Cain points at a BIG GUY, heavily muscled, eagerly waving his hand. \n[291]No, next to him! He points at a BOY, about nine years old and not very big. \n[292]So? You got something against kids? Zed plays the crowd which starts booing in disapproval. \n[293]This guy hates kids! \n[294]Good thinking, huh? They turn to face the boy, ready to dodge when he throws. The boy winds up and fires a major league fastball that smacks Oh right on the forehead. The crowd cheers. \n[295]Holy shit! That kid's got an arm! \n[296]Wait! I have a question for the King! The crowd goes silent. All eyes turn and look up to the palace balcony. \n[297]Why didn't I die in the Holy of Holies? On the balcony, everyone is totally stopped by his question. One by one they all look to the High Priest who seems to be stumped. In the square, the crowd starts muttering. Zed seizes the initiative. \n[298]I entered the Holy of Holies and, lo, I did not die! Why? Because I am chosen by the Gods! \n[299]Yes! \n[300]Hey! Boys! Long time no see. They glance up, but ignore him. \n[301]Don't tell me you're still mad about Maya. That's so over. I have a thing going with the princess now-- well, almost had a thing. I'm a slave now-- just like you. \n[302]Okay. We do have our differences-- like about a cup and half of brain tissue-- but that doesn't mean we can't work together. Another GUARD approaches and whacks Marlak with his stick. \n[303]You know, I'd like to, but I did something to my neck--  I must've slept on it funny-- those dungeon pillows are like rocks-- well, they are rocks-- so I should probably take it easy or I'll be no damn good for work tomorrow. \n[304]Okay! But I should tell you, this isn't really my area. I'm just on a break from the mud department-- The Guard draws his short sword and raises it over Zed. \n[305]Okay, okay. I'm going. (to Marlak and \n[306]Learned that from Maya. Good trick, huh? Okay, together this time. Go!     Official White                                                                                     109. They pull together and the heavy cart starts to move. \n[307]How high you guys think we're going with this? \n[308]That's ambitious. \n[309]That's nothing. You should see it when I'm excited. \n[310]Oh, right, the tower. Incredible erection.  \n[311]You're from the village, aren't you? The child nods. \n[312]I bet you wish you were back there right now, don't you. The child nods again. \n[313]Well, don't give up. You're going to get home someday. Marlak kicks Zed from behind, knocking him over. \n[314]How are you seeing that far? \n[315]It's Maya! \n[316]I have to get down there. \n[317]Wow. Who saw that coming? Thanks, Marlak. \n[318]Lower me down. Without waiting for a response, Zed bravely jumps off the top of the ziggurat holding the rope.     Official White                                                                   116. Marlak looks at the rope in his hands, pulls it a little and sees that it's not attached to the rope Zed was holding. \n[319]He's descending rapidly, rappelling off the side of the ziggurat. He looks up, expecting Marlak to belay him and slow him down. \n[320]Any time now, Marlak! Marlak and Enmebaragesi watch his descent, dumbly interested in what happens next. Zed sees he's not slowing down and tries to swing himself onto one of the upper levels of the ziggurat. However, when he swings in, he hits a cart loaded with bricks and bounces off painfully. \n[321]I don't think so! Zed is standing atop the idol's head, brandishing a sword and shield. \n[322]I said, 'I don't think so!' \n[323]I Said, 'I don't think so.' \n[324]Whatever that last thing you said was. \n[325]Let her go. \n[326]Why don't we just sacrifice something small-- a rabbit maybe. Or a duck. That'd be good, don't you think? \n[327]I'm the, uh, Chosen One, I guess, and on behalf of, well, the whole city, I want to thank the High Priest for his incredible sacrifice. That was really something, wasn't it? He starts clapping, then Oh starts clapping, and soon all the people in the square are applauding. At that moment a single drop of rain falls and hits Zed in the eye. He looks up, a few more drops, then a hard steady rain starts to fall. The people all look up in awe, then someone cheers and they all roar in celebration. Then the rain stops as suddenly as it started. The cheers die away, and confused, dissatisfied muttering begins. \n[328]People! Friends! Sodomites! Okay, that was a little confusing, wasn't it?      \n[329]Was that a sign from God? Wasn't it a sign? What's the deal? We all want to know. But I'm not sure anybody really knows-- and I'd be real suspicious of people who say they do. If I've learned one thing, it's this: the world and everything in it is a miracle. And what that miracle means is for each and every one of us to figure out for himself. Are the Gods going to destroy us? Maybe-- I don't know-- I guess it's possible. But if we keep going the way we are, they won't have to. We're doing a pretty good job of destroying ourselves. So maybe we should all just go home now, and think about what happened-- and be very, very good to each other. I know I'm going to try. (raises his hand in salute to the people Peace. The crowd stares at him blankly. Nobody knows what to make of it all. Then Marlak shouts loud enough for all to hear. \n[330]That's what I've been trying to tell you. Zed and Maya, Oh and Eema stand there basking in the gratitude of the people as Inanna looks on. \n[331]Well said, Marlak. You really have a way with words. They clasp hands. \n[332]Not much to tell, is there? Just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire. No big deal. Oh is at the front of the caravan, giving orders, but no one is listening to him. Zed joins him. \n[333]Everybody ready?     Official White                                                          126. \n[334]Might head down to Egypt. I hear it's a happening kinda place. \n[335]Not necessarily. You want to come?     Official White                                                             127. \n[336]Traveling light, huh? Okay, here we go.  To the west! \n[337]I knew that. Just wanted to see if you did. Zed grins and they start walking, passing a small herd of sheep and goats, tended by VEILED WOMEN, going in the opposite direction. As THE LAST OF THE SHEPHERD WOMEN passes, we notice something masculine about her build and posture. Zed nods politely to her, but she averts her eyes and turns away from him. ", "OH": "\n[1]Look at them. Hunters think they're so cool. They don't think gathering is dangerous? There are thorns-- bees-- those big stingy ants. I could hunt-- I just don't want to. And what's with the blood on their faces? They think that's sanitary?     Official White                                                             7. \n[2]Why did you eat that fruit? It's forbidden. Everybody knows that. \n[3]I think, and I could be wrong, that all the poop makes the ground more fertile, which in turn, gives the leaves in the area a softer feel. It's a vicious circle. Oh notices a very pretty young woman, EEMA, standing near the communal fire with TWO HUNTERS. His heart leaps. \n[4]Hi, Eema! Eema turns, sees it's him and gives him a perfunctory wave, then turns back to the hunters and says something about Oh that makes them laugh.     Official White                                                            8. \n[5]She doesn't even know I exist.  I want to lay with her so badly. \n[6]Of course not! She's your sister! It'd be like sleeping with your mother. \n[7]My hut's a mess. And what if she struggles? \n[8]No. She only likes hunters-- not gatherers. They look over at Eema, who is now slowly stroking the shaft of a hunter's spear. \n[9]Okay, I think somebody's had enough.     Official White                                                                               11. \n[10]You make babies-- \n[11]You always get like this when you smoke. Oh takes a big toke on the pipe, chokes, and starts coughing uncontrollably. \n[12]No. \n[13]There's nothing on the other side of the mountains. Everybody knows that. The world just ends. You'd fall right off the edge.  \n[14]Oh, yeah, that's plausible. Zed flings the rock away. \n[15]Will you stop with that crazy talk? We're at a feast. You love feasts. There's women, there's boar meat, there's an assortment of berries-- there's women-- Oh looks over at Eema. Zed picks up on it. \n[16]You think? They're playing the Jackal Dance. I don't do that one so well. \n[17]Hey! What's going on? Marlak growls at him. \n[18]\n[19]I guess I'm with you. \n[20]No, the fire. I lost everything.     Official White                                                                                       21. \n[21]Can we talk about this later? Oh pulls Zed to his feet, and they sneak off into the deep woods. \n[22]Yeah, it's great. \n[23]I don't think they'll forget the fire. \n[24]If it's that huge how would we carry it back? \n[25]Yeah, we'll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel. Will you get real? There's no going back! There's, nothing to go back to! It's just ashes. \n[26]You're a pile of sticks and dung. Suddenly, Zed stops and stands perfectly still. \n[27]What are you doing? Zed makes a minimal gesture with his head. Oh looks up. A COUGAR crouches on a tree limb above them, poised to leap. Oh freezes. They talk like ventriloquists. \n[28]Will that work? \n[29]What are you going to do? \n[30]I just want to know why you told me not to move, and you ran. \n[31]Yeah, big favor. \n[32]Yes, you did! You looked right at me-- twice. \n[33]No, eat your weasel. You deserve it. He turns his back to Zed, and starts sorting through the pile of sticks. \n[34]No, arrows. We're going to need them. \n[35]Yes. Zed claps him on the back and hugs him exuberantly. Oh winces in pain. \n[36]Incredible. He takes a step forward, the rock shelf gives way beneath his feet and he falls a great distance, screaming all the way down, bouncing painfully off the big boulders, then a long, tumbling slide over sharp rocks and gravel to the bottom. \n[37]I see a pattern. Every time something terrible can happen to me, it does. \n[38]You think? There's about a thousand footprints here.     Official White                                                                                                     26. He indicates the heavily trampled forest floor. \n[39]No, thank you. \n[40]Okay. \n[41]Okay! Enough! Can we just go? Maybe we can find where they peed. 14                                                              Then Zed sees light through the trees and creeps   14 stealthily to the tree line. Oh creeps up beside him and they peer through the bushes. THREE COWS are grazing in a green pasture. Beyond it, well- tended fields of growing grain. Zed snaps into stalking mode, ducks down and silently signals Oh to be quiet and stay put. \n[42]He's a hunter. I'm more of a \"maker.\" I made this loincloth, I do arrows-- I made a shelf unit for my hut-- \n[43]Well, it's hard to say-- we just \n[44]Shouldn't we do something? \n[45]Probably just tuckered out from the fight. \n[46]Right! You were holding the rock and he-- accidentally ran into it-- really hard-- with his head. \n[47]Oh, yeah, people could so easily misinterpret that.     Official White                                                                      31. \n[48]why don't we go with you? \n[49]Hey! What about me? \n[50]That's really good.     Official White                                                                                   37. \n[51]Do I have to? \n[52]\n[53]Can I have one of those? He reaches for a loaf but the MERCHANT strikes his hand with a cane. \n[54]Ow! \n[55]Hi, Eema. \n[56]Are you all right? Did they-- rape you? \n[57]Let me talk to the guy. Maybe I can make a deal with him. You guys wait here. Cain puts his arm around the slave trader's shoulder and walks him away. \n[58]What an amazing coincidence-- running into you and Maya and them. \n[59]I don't know. Why do you think? \n[60]To get laid? \n[61]which omnipotent force? \n[62]I don't know! What's \"omnipotent\" mean? \n[63]Why would he want that? \n[64]Why would God choose you? Why wouldn't he choose Marlak? He's stronger.     Official White                                                          45. \n[65]You do have a fat face. \n[66]You're not even-- I'm smarter than you! \n[67]Why? Just 'cause he murdered his brother and got hit by lightning? They are pushed to the front of the platform. \n[68]They probably don't know how smart you think you are. Finally, a Bedouin SHEIK raises his giraffe-tail fly whisk and waves it at the slave trader. \n[69]Excuse me-- I'm sorry-- (his hand gets stuck between her breasts That's not good-- He jerks his hand away, elbowing Marlak in the face.     Official White                                                             48. Marlak growls and grabs Oh by the throat, but the struggle forces everyone else to shift which causes even more discomfort. \n[70]Hold on! I'm coming! Oh tries to maneuver to Zed, but can't move an inch. OH                                                                                                        (cont'd) If everyone could just move to the right. Please? Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  You can do it, Zed! Use his weight against him! \n[71]Their hats? I'm sorry, but when that one guy cut the other guy's head off, my first thought wasn't, \"Gee, what a great hat.\" \n[72]How are we going to rescue anybody? They're killers! \n[73]Not that well. I think I was over- tired. Then Zed suddenly remembers Maya. He looks and sees that the soldiers and slaves are long gone. \n[74]Now where do we go? Zed sniffs the air, puts his ear to the ground, and tastes the sand. \n[75]Why do I listen to you? Now we're going to starve to death or die of thirst. \n[76]You know, I've asked people about that and no one else seems to remember it. \n[77]He was a small man. Oh collapses face down in the sand. Pull back to reveal that they are surrounded by hungry jackals, vultures and hyenas. \n[78]Are they nice? \n[79]And where exactly are those cities? \n[80]--of his wealthy bounty. Abraham gets a strange faraway look in his eyes.     Official White                                                        60. \n[81]Couldn't we could just get our ears pierced? \n[82]You have any idea where we're going? \n[83]The city! He said God's going to smite them with holy fire! \n[84]He seemed to know what he was talking about. \n[85]Gee, they're not open. We should probably come back later. \n[86]Me? Why do I have to knock? What if we're waking somebody up? Let's just get out of here. \n[87]Meaner than this? The sentry grabs Oh's nipple and twists. Oh SCREAMS loudly. The guards freeze at the sound of his scream and look nervously to a closed door at one end of the room.     Official White                                                             65. \n[88]Don't have to wait 'til morning. \n[89]Yeah, thanks for saving us. What are you going to do to us now? Cain stops and looks at them. \n[90]We are so in! She's eye-knowing us like crazy. \n[91]Well, I kind of have a girlfriend-- not a girlfriend, yet, but a girl I like, so I shouldn't-- \n[92]Sorry. \n[93]You look good, but I think my hat's too big. They notice an OFFICER staring at them. \n[94]Do you happen to know where I could get a smaller hat? The officer pops him on the head with a truncheon. \n[95]You can't blame people for being hungry. \n[96]Gee, I wonder why? The royal guard takes his foot off Zed's neck and they all get back to their feet. \n[97]Where's everybody going? \n[98]You throw the virgin in the fire so it'll rain? \n[99]These virgins-- it's always a girl, right? \n[100]Can't I go with him? \n[101]Hah! No? That would be weird. \n[102]So what do you do?     Official White                                                                                    79. \n[103]You've been living here since you were nine?  I should look into that. How do you get to be a eunuch? \n[104]What?! What's up with all the genital mutilation? \n[105]No, I'd miss them-- I'm sure. I hardly got to use them yet. The Eunuch leads him down the corridor. \n[106]I'm not supposed to talk. I'm a statue. \n[107]How's it going? I just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls, and believe me, he was very thorough, if you know what I mean. How's it going with you? \n[108]That sounds nice-- for you. \n[109]There's Eema! Eema has been beautifully groomed and is now dressed as a household slave. She stops to serve some rowdy OFFICERS who take the opportunity to tease and fondle her. She tries to pull away but Sargon, the general, grabs her arm. \n[110]I haven't joined anything.  Does this look like fun? They both look accusingly at Zed. \n[111]What? Like human sacrifice? \n[112]Here we go again-- \n[113]I don't know. So much has happened. Sometimes I think-- She walks away. \n[114]I love you. \n[115]I'd rather not, if you don't mind. I'm not really a slave. I'm a guard. \n[116]Are those my choices?     Official White                                                           89. \n[117]How's that? \n[118]That enough? \n[119]With my hands? \n[120]Eema! This isn't what you think.     Official White                                                                                                 90. \n[121]No, really! I'm just-- rubbing oil on this man. She exits. \n[122]Ughh. \n[123]That's so-- unselfish of you. \n[124]So where does that hall lead to? \n[125]Wow.  So who cleans it? \n[126]No, of course not.  Kind of makes you wonder though-- the guys who built it, did they just die the minute they finished, or did the Gods give them a second to get out? \n[127]Yeah, that's probably it.  So you're saying we can't go in? \n[128]Right, right, right.  What if we just open the doors and stick our heads in? \n[129]Seize him! The guards arrest Oh as Cain steps up and takes hold of Zed. \n[130]What have you done for me? I've been attacked by a cougar, I've fallen down a mountain, I almost had the tip of my thingy cut off, I've been greasing up the High Priest all night, and now I'm hanging upside down in a dungeon. And I have to pee real bad. All because of you. You call yourself a friend? Name one good thing you've done for me. \n[131]I really have to pee-- \n[132]The only one who thinks you're chosen is you, so shut up already! \n[133]Guard! I have to pee! Now! Seriously!  Oh, no--     Official White                                                                                       101. Because he's upside down, the streams runs down his stomach, over his chest, down his neck, onto his chin and over his face. \n[134]I hate you. \n[135]I think he hit me. The boy fires again. Oh spins and tries to duck but takes the rock right on the head. \n[136]Hey! There's two of us! The crowd cheers and pats the kid on the back. \n[137]And his friend! Don't forget his friend! On the balcony, the King and his ministers hastily confer with the High Priest. \n[138]Okay, you think that actually makes anybody work harder? It just makes them resent you. Is that what you want? \n[139]Can I just ask when lunch is? The whip lashes out again. Oh glowers at him and steps up the pace. \n[140]Where're we going? \n[141]Is that compulsory? Because I saw one when I first got here and it made me a little sick-- The guard's whip catches him across the back. \n[142]Ow! Why don't you try using your words for a change? \n[143]See the High Priest? I know him. Dear friend of mine. \n[144]That's Eema! And Maya! I know them! \n[145]We have to do something! Somebody has to stop it. (turning to the other \n[146]He seizes the opportunity. \n[147]A sign! It's a sign! The Chosen One comes! The other slaves and people in the crowd pick up his excitement.     Official White                                                                             118. \n[148]I know him, too. Oh springs into action, attacking the big guard in front of him. The other slaves see that and start fighting with their guards, a genuine slave revolt. \n[149]Hello, Eema. \n[150]Eema, you're my woman! You hear me? \n[151]Really? It's okay? He pulls her into an embrace and kisses her hard on the mouth. Then, out of the corner of his eye, Oh sees a guard rushing at him. Oh whirls and falls off the platform, accidentally cutting the guards legs out from under him. \n[152]Then how about this? The High Priest turns to Oh. Oh is holding the big sacramental pitcher. \n[153]More oil?     Official White                                                             123. He splashes the High Priest with a gallon of oil, soaking him from head to toe. As the oil hits the High Priest, Zed dashes across and snatches Maya from his grasp. The High Priest spins around in a rage, his long robes wrap around his legs hobbling him, he totters on his high platform shoes, loses his balance and gets too close to the idol's fiery mouth. Totally drenched in oil, he bursts into flame like a human torch, screams, and staggers right into the mouth of the furnace. \n[154]Yeah, just about-- I guess so. The Hebrews are going to lead us to the sea and we can get boats from there. We can trade all this stuff everybody gave us for the trip home.  I don't think I should be the leader. Nobody's listening to me. \n[155]Come back to the village sometime. Zed nods, they shake hands, then they embrace. Stifling a tear, Oh breaks away and whips the lead camel. \n[156]Hee-ya!  Come on. People are watching. The camel looks at him and slowly lumbers off. Oh sighs gratefully and signals the caravan to follow. As the great caravan moves off, Zed is left standing there with nothing but a long staff, and a bundle on the ground beside him to which is tied his sword, shield and helmet. Maya joins him. ", "CAIN": "\n[1]You are called suck. \n[2]\"God looked on my sacrifice with \n[3]You think you're so superior to everyone else. \n[4]Really? Let's see how good you are at getting your ass kicked.  \n[5]No! This smug asshole insulted you and I want him to take it back. \n[6]Take it back!     Official White                                                           29. \n[7]still holding the bloody \n[8]He's all right. Probably just \n[9]Yeah.      \n[10]Maybe I should throw some dirt on him-- keep him warm 'til he wakes up. He starts kicking dirt over Abel's body. \n[11]This is bad. This is really bad. We're in serious trouble. \n[12]You could've stopped me! There's two of you and only one of me. \n[13]You calling me a murderer?  \n[14]It was an accident!  Right? \n[15]Okay-- yeah-- good. But it might be better if we don't mention the \"accident\" to anyone. People might get the wrong idea. Understand? \n[16]I like you guys. You're all right. Why don't you come with me? Have supper with the family. \n[17]I think you should come with me. \n[18]They're wheels, numbskull. They make the cart roll. \n[19]Hail, Father. Cain stops the cart and dismounts with Zed and Oh. \n[20]Can these guys stay for supper? (off Adam's questioning \n[21]Abel? Haven't seen him. I thought he was with you.  You guys see him? They shake their heads and cough nervously. \n[22]I think that was yesterday. \n[23]That might've been Boaz--- \n[24]Hey, we're brothers, we argue sometimes- it's not that big a deal.     Official White                                                           34. \n[25]Okay! What am I-- his keeper? Get off my back, will you? He smashes his plate against the wall and storms out. An awkward silence as Zed and Oh exchange guilty looks. \n[26]It's been the same damn thing my whole life.  \"Why can't you be more like Abel?\"  \"Oh, your sacrifice was good, too, but Abel's was-- wow!\"  \n[27]Yeah, hey-- where's everybody going? \n[28]Good luck. \n[29]I said good luck. I'm really worried about him. He turns aside and makes a goofy sarcastic face for Oh's benefit. \n[30]Yeah, I am. I just have to finish toiling over here, then I'm right behind you. Adam and the others hurry off, and as soon as they're gone, Cain rushes over and starts harnessing the oxen to the cart. \n[31]Now listen, I'm getting out of here, and you better come with me. I have a feeling they're going to try and blame this whole \"Abel- killing-thing\" on you. \n[32]Because when they find him and his head is all bashed in, they're going to start pointing fingers, and you guys are drifters, so they'll put two and two together and that makes-- He stares expectantly at Zed and Oh. \n[33]Four! It makes four! Now stop asking so many questions and hop on. We gotta get out of here! He urgently whips the oxen and they climb aboard as the cart lumbers forward. \n[34]They're gaining on us! Zed and Oh look back. \n[35]Hah! They'll never catch us now! An aerial view shows Cain's cart slowly pulling away from his pursuers. Suddenly a bolt of lightning splits the bright blue sky and strikes Cain right on the forehead, knocking him back into the cart. He sits up stunned, with a still-smoking, jagged burn mark on his forehead.     Official White                                                                                   40. \n[36]Wow! What are the odds of that?!  Am I lucky or what? Zed and Oh exchange doubtful looks and glance nervously at the sky. \n[37]We're gonna need some money.     Official White                                                             41. \n[38]Perhaps I can help. (confidentially to Zed and \n[39]So what are we lookin' at here? From a distance, Zed and Oh watch them talking, but can't hear what they're saying. \n[40]Hey! Come here. I think we worked something out. \n[41]Wait! I know these guys! \n[42]Brothers!! He embraces them. They look confused and doubtful, but relieved. \n[43]You know, you guys are lucky that sergeant is a friend of mine. I let him sodomize me once right after I got here and he's been real nice to me ever since. \n[44]wait a second. Do I detect a tone here? \n[45]Whoa whoa whoa! Hold a grudge much? That was like a fortnight ago. \n[46]Give me a break! I was dealing with the death of a close family member and I needed some space. But now I realize that you guys are like my brothers. And it's so rare to find a brother that you love. Right? He embraces them. \n[47]Now, you guys hungry? Watch this. Cain walks up to a food vendor's stall and stares menacingly at the VENDOR. He raises his fist. The vendor cowers.     Official White                                                             68. CAIN                                                               (cont'd)  That's two for flinching. Cain grabs two lamb kebabs and hands them to Zed and Oh. \n[48]That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about. As they eat hungrily, Zed makes eye contact with a prostitute lounging in a doorway. \n[49]You're gonna love Sodom. Trust me. It's crazy. This morning, I almost got a handie behind that pita stand. \n[50]Hey, what happens in Sodom, stays in Sodom. He takes a jug of wine from the stall of a WINE MERCHANT. The merchant just bows obsequiously and keeps his mouth shut. \n[51]You know, if you guys are staying you should join the guards. The pay's not great, but there's tons of perks. I'm telling you, it's the only way to go. Cain grabs a piece of candy from a SMALL CHILD and stuffs it in his mouth. The child starts crying, Cain kicks her in the ass and she runs away.     Official White                                                                      69. \n[52]Come on, I'll introduce you to the captain. \n[53]Pretty much. We just look for troublemakers and kick the living shit out of 'em. \n[54]If we see a thief or a pickpocket, we just slap him around-- maybe cut off a finger or an ear, or the tip of his nose, lower lip-- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion-- then we take our share of the loot and let him go. Mostly what we worry about are activist types, rabble rousers, getting people all riled up against the King or the Temple Priests. That's death for sure. \n[55]Harsh times, brother. We're in the middle of a famine. People are starving. If we don't get some rain soon, it could get ugly.  Then we'll get to start kicking ass big time. He stops to flog a BEGGAR with his hand out. \n[56]Beat it, you filthy beggar! \n[57]Yeah, well, just remember, it's the palace that pays you, not the people.     Official White                                                             71. Suddenly, they hear a regal fanfare of approaching trumpets and turn to look. At the sound of the trumpets EVERYONE IN THE CROWDED SQUARE falls to the ground and prostrates himself. Cain pulls Oh to the ground but Zed is left standing there oblivious as the ROYAL ENTOURAGE approaches. Oh taps on Zed's leg trying to get his attention, but Zed just ignores it, too transfixed to notice that he's the only one standing. EIGHT STRONG MALE SLAVES enter the square carrying an ornately decorated litter shaded with a silk canopy. On it is the PRINCESS INANNA, a stunning young woman, richly dressed and bejeweled, with exotic eyes and luscious red lips. A HANDMAIDEN rides along fanning her with a big ostrich plume fan. Zed sees the Princess and is instantly taken with her beauty. Princess Inanna glances his way and can't help but notice he's the only person in the square still standing. She gives him a quizzical smile, then turns away imperiously. As the litter passes, her handmaiden continues to stare at Zed. He doesn't recognize her, but we do. It's Maya, now elaborately costumed and made-up. Zed gawks at the Princess, then suddenly a ROYAL GUARD knocks him to the ground and stands on his neck as the rest of the entourage passes. \n[58]The Princess Inanna. She's totally hot, but don't even think about it.     Official White                                                                                       72. \n[59]Because she's royalty and you're scum? The entire crowd starts moving in the same direction as the royal entourage. \n[60]To the temple. Let's go.  You have to see this. \n[61]Everybody will be there. \n[62]Oh yeah. Uh huh. Uh huh. \n[63]It's pretty self-explanatory. \n[64]Her wish is my command. \n[65]The three of us are inseparable. We're like brothers. Cain squeezes both their shoulders and gives Maya an artificial smile.     Official White                                                              78. Maya ignores Cain and points to Zed and Oh. \n[66]I wouldn't know.- I'm just a guard because my \"brother\" didn't pull any strings with his friends in the royal court. \n[67]Just like Abel. I oughta just bash your head in-- \n[68]Yeah, sure. Have a nice orgy. Cain pulls open the big doors and Zed steps through the portal. Cain tries to steal peeks inside as the heavy doors slam shut. \n[69]Should've invited me to the party. \n[70]For the crimes of blasphemy-- (the crowd grumbles its \n[71]Shut up! For these and other crimes they may not actually have done yet but we're pretty sure they were thinking about, the prisoners will be stoned to death. The crowd roars as GUARDS stationed around the square pull canvas covers off big baskets of rocks and the people rush to grab stones to throw. Zed and Oh instinctively move closer to each other. \n[72]Anything to say before the sentence is carried out? \n[73]\n[74]Okay! Stop! Halt! Hold it! This isn't working. \n[75]What?     Official White                                                             103. \n[76]Him? \n[77]He's just a kid!     Official White                                                             104. \n[78]All right! All right! We'll try it. Kid! Grab a rock. The boy picks up a good-size rock. Zed turns to Oh. \n[79]Okay, everybody on this side now! On the count of three! One-- two--     Official white                                                            105. \n[80]Can't we just stone them a little? \n[81]At your service, my lady. Anytime, anywhere. \n[82]Thank you, your majesty. He touches his tongue to the tip of his nose and waggles his eyebrows. The King arrives with Sargon to loud booing from the crowd.     Official White                                                        112. \n[83]Your Highness, with all due respect, those were \"Woos.\" They love you. They were \"wooing\" you. The King looks doubtfully at the hostile crowd. \n[84]Just doing my duty. \n[85]Tough guy, huh? You want a piece of me? Get ready to have your head bashed in!     Official White                                                               121. As Cain raises his truncheon, Marlak HEAD-BUTTS him. \n[86]Nice move! He passes out and goes down. \n[87]Peace--- brother. zed does a double take at the voice, shrugs, and walks off with Maya-- as a torrential rain begins to fall. ", "MAYA": "\n[1]You know what I'd really like? \n[2]Some fruit. \n[3]No. He scans the nearby trees. \n[4]Nuh-uh. \n[5]\n[6]\n[7]Nope. \n[8]That one. Zed looks. It's a beautiful tree with lush, apple-like   red fruit hanging from it. \n[9]Why not?

I understand if you're afraid-- \n[14]No, really, it's all right. I just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks, crawls, swims, flies, or grows in the ground, but not that particular fruit. And I thought you might be the kind of man who's willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself, but I guess I was wrong. She glares defiantly at Zed, then starts to walk away. It's not Paradise anymore. Then like every man that ever lived and will ever live, he caves.

Zed considers for a long moment then decides. \n[17]So you're saying it's not good? \n[18]Ooh, banana! \n[19]Thank you, Marlak. 4 \n[20]Zed, just admit it. You're just making it harder on yourself. \n[21]Well, after the fire-- (she shoots him an accusing look)) --the hill tribes raided the village. The men fought them but they were too many. They took us captive, marched us to the sea, then traded us to the boat people who brought us here. \n[22]Hey! \n[23]How do you know God's a \"He?\" Zed rolls his eyes. \n[24]You think we've been chosen by God? \n[25]I want to trust you. \n[26]For you maybe. \n[27]So does everybody else. \n[28]The Princess wishes to see you. \n[29]Not you. Him.  \n[30]The two of you follow me. \n[31]This is Zaftig the Eunuch. You go with him. Oh is led away by the Eunuch as she takes Zed off in the opposite direction. \n[32]As you wish.  Be sure to try the fruit. Zed looks at her and finally recognizes her. \n[33]I had no choice. I'm a slave, remember? \n[34]Wait here until you're sent for. \n[35]Of course not. You were just chosen again. Maybe after you and the Princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself. She walks off before he can answer. Zed shakes his head, looks around the room, then STARTS walking past a row of \"LIVING STATUES,\" semi-nude men and women on pedestals covered head to toe in gold body paint, frozen in heroic postures that show off their beautiful bodies. Zed looks closely at one beautiful nude \"GODDESS\", then furtively reaches out and fondles her breast. The goddess slaps his hand, then resumes her pose. \n[36]She wants to see you-- now. \n[37]Why would I think that? Just because you couldn't take your eyes off her-- \n[38]What's your plan? \n[39]Forget it. Maya sees A GUARD watching them and reverts to her slave attitude. \n[40]The Princess awaits you.     Official White                                                                    88. \n[41]Good luck. \n[42]She sees him and starts to revive. \n[43]Zed! \n[44]You're incredible, you know that? \n[45]Where will you go now? \n[46]Are you going alone? \n[47]I'll get my things. She gestures off and he sees a small train of camels and horses loaded with a ton of her personal possessions. \n[48]The Princess gave me a few gifts when she freed us. \n[49]That's west. ", "HIGH PRIEST": "\n[1]O El, lord of Heaven and Earth; Baal, the Sublime; Shapash, goddess of the sun; Hadad, the storm god, over-ruling son of Dagon, the bountiful, god of grain, our earthly sustenance-- \n[2]We come before you in humble supplication, invoking your blessing, the sweet rain which waters our fields, enriches the harvest, fills our storehouses, makes mighty the house of Ish-ka-bi- baal and the city of Sodom-- The King nods graciously. \n[3]--and feeds us, your children, with the bounty of your grace. \n[4]Accept now this humble sacrifice to the power and glory of your magnificence. He starts inspecting the Vestal Virgins, beautiful young women in diaphanous, almost transparent white gowns. \n[5]For the love of the Gods and the glory of their Creation, the great dome of Heaven, the green growing Earth, we commit this maiden to your Holy Fire. Another great cheer from the crowd as they throw her into the fire. \n[6]Well, the liver is streaked with gray-- that's not a favorable sign-- but the heart looks good. See how nice and red it is here. That's always a good omen. \n[7]Usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself, probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay. \n[8]Well, it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart-- or that you're going on a long sea voyage! Wouldn't that be fun? \n[9]Because I'm your brother? \n[10]Perhaps it's not time for a new High Priest. Aaaahh! He dramatically flings his fingers out at the Prime Minister, as if wielding the power of the Gods. Nothing happens. \n[11]And let that be a warning to you. Next time, I will hurl a lightning bolt at your face.      \n[12]Or a fire-ball. \n[13]You there! Golden boy! Rub me with oil. The High Priest dismisses the young men, then stands and lets his rich outer robe fall to the floor. His chest, back and shoulders are incredibly hairy. \n[14]Then maybe you'd rather I speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life. Or perhaps I whip you myself? How would you like that? \n[15]I'd say so. The High Priest lies back down. Oh looks around, finds a pitcher filled with precious oil and dribbles some on the High Priest's hairy chest. \n[16]More. \n[17]No! More oil! Much more, you insolent dolt! Oh pours oil liberally over his chest, back, and shoulders. \n[18]That's good. Now rub it in. \n[19]Do it! Oh grimaces and starts gingerly massaging the oil into his hairy chest and shoulders. \n[20]Mmmmm, I love it. The sweet scent of precious oil. The oily-- oiliness. Eema walks by with a pitcher of wine and sees Oh massaging the High Priest. She gasps. \n[21]Mnum imam. I have an idea. Why don't we go back to my place and see what's under all that paint? \n[22]My life is devoted to the service of the Gods and the good of the people. I take nothing for myself. He has a huge gold ring set with precious gems on every finger, and a gold tiara on his head studded with rubies and emeralds. \n[23]Yes, it is. It's just so-- lonely. Sometimes i hunger for the touch of another human being.  Here's a riddle: what has two thumbs and wants another oil rub? (pointing thumbs at \n[24]Come, I'll show you. He takes Oh's arm and leads him down the hail toward a set of incredibly impressive doors covered with cuneiform writing and arcane religious symbols. \n[25]Behind those doors is the Holy of Holies-- the earthly domain of the      Official White \n[26]Gods-- a place so ineffably sacred, so powerful, that to enter is instant death for any mortal. \n[27]it needs no cleaning. \n[28]I assume they finished it, then the Gods descended. \n[29]I just told you! To enter is instant death! Only I can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings. \n[30]Fine! Enough! I'm sorry I brought it up. Let's go.  Move. Move. He shoos him down the hall.

Well and truly, the Gods are with us-- The crowd drowns him out. \n[35]Burn them! Now! He grabs Maya and starts dragging her toward the gaping mouth of the idol and the raging fire within. She struggles but is too drugged to put up much resistance. He grabs the sacramental pitcher of oil and starts sloppily anointing her. \n[36]May the balm of this healing oil soothe your journey through the sacred fire!  Don't fight it! It's the will of the Gods! Then, a voice from above.     Official White                                                             119. \n[37]What did you say? \n[38]Still not getting it. Zed rolls his eyes in frustration and starts tentatively climbing down from the top of the idol. He jumps the last few feet and lands right in front of the fire, blocking the High Priest's way. \n[39]You don't think what? \n[40]I forgot.  Guards!     Official White                                                                            120. Guards rush toward Zed from all sides, but he fights like a demon, slashing, spinning, stabbing, fending off their blows with his shield. Oh is inspired by Zed's courage. \n[41]Keep away! \n[42]No! The Gods demand a sacrifice! And you ruined it! He wrestles Maya even closer to the fire. \n[43]No! A duck would not be good! \n[44]Hot!

Those new linen pants you got me from Egypt make my ass look just huge. \n[4]Why not? Everybody else is starving-- present company excluded.

I'm just so incredibly bored. \n[7]Isn't that the idiot who was standing up in the street? Maya sees him, too, and starts fuming. The High Priest continues. \n[8]Can the Gods really be so cruel? \n[9]Good. See that he's bathed and dressed, then bring him to me. Maya frowns and exits. \n[10]This should be amusing. \n[11]Come to me. Zed turns and sees the Princess standing on the terrace. \n[12]Beautiful, isn't it? You can see Gomorrah just over the hill.     Official White                                   91. \n[13]They're called the \"twin cities.\" \n[14]And what do you think? Am I evil? \n[15]I have body issues. \n[16]My eyes are brown. \n[17]I don't know. I just find you-- interesting. They say it's the will of the gods that some men should suffer while others rule-- that we're all just victims of our fate. And I believed that until this morning when I saw you standing up, alone, in the square. And I said to myself, finally here's one man who refuses to bow down to anything-- \n[18]Yes, finally a man who has the courage to question the order of things--- a man chosen by the Gods to do something great. \n[19]I know why. To bring you here-- to this place-- to me. \n[20]Come. She takes his hand and leads him away. A SHADOWY FIGURE watches them from behind a curtain. \n[21]I want you to enter the Holy of Holies. \n[22]That's the Holy of Holies-- you have to go in there and talk to the Gods. \n[23]So they say, but the only one who ever goes in is the High Priest. They say it's instant death for anyone else to enter. \n[24]Because you were chosen? If the Gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already. \n[25]This is what you've been chosen for! To speak to the Gods and plead with them not to destroy the city. Then come back out and tell me what it's like inside.

More virgins to sacrifice? \n[31]I'll see you all in Hell. ", "MARLAK": "\n[1]For you. \n[2]You didn't hunt today. \n[3]What's that supposed to be? \n[4]That's not a bear. That's just some lines on a skin. \n[5]That's stupid. \n[6]And what's that? He picks up a skin with another of Zed's drawings on it, this one of a big-breasted naked girl. Zed quickly grabs it and holds it upside down. \n[7]It looks like Maya.

Villagers gather around them, Maya and Eema among them. Marlak puts his spear point to Zed's throat. \n[12]The truth!     Official White                                                       14. \n[13]You laid with my woman? \n[14]Your father was a great hunter, but you're like-- a girl. The hunters laugh. \n[15]Now I kill you. He's about to spear Zed when suddenly the Shaman screams and jumps between them. The villagers step back as the Shaman howls an incantation and shakes his magic rattle at Zed. \n[16]Now you die. Marlak throws his spear and misses as Zed takes off running into the forest with the hunters right behind him and the whole village ablaze. \n[17]I see you. \n[18]Yes, I do. \n[19]You're trying to trick me. \n[20]You think I'm going to turn around and look, but I'm not.  I'm going to gut you like a pig. He is about to plunge his knife into Zed when suddenly he is struck from behind by a heavy tree branch. He falls heavily, knocked senseless by Oh who is standing over him with the makeshift club. Zed sits up and smiles gratefully at Oh. \n[21]Get away from my woman! \n[22]I'll kill you! Marlak starts muscling and squirming his way through the body pile trying to get to Zed. \n[23]No. You're not just like me. \n[24]Who's going to take her there? The Chosen One? Marlak kicks gravel and dirt in Zed's face. Zed just lies there and takes it, feeling like he's failed everyone. Then he hears the beating of drums and trumpet fanfares coming from the temple square below. \n[25]All right. Without a moment's hesitation, Marlak grabs him and tosses him off the top of the ziggurat. He screams all the way down. \n[26]Now what? Zed looks around quickly, grabs the end of a long coiled rope attached to a big pulley, and hands Marlak the other end. \n[27]All hail the Chosen One! With that the crowd explodes into rousing cheers. In the midst of the crowd, Abraham looks around and scowls. \n[28]You did good.

Without another word Abraham takes strong hold of Isaac and lifts him up onto the firewood. \n[4]Okay, if this is because I didn't clean up my tent, you can stop now. I get it. Then Abraham pulls a long slaughtering knife from beneath his robe. \n[5]All right, this isn't funny anymore! Abraham raises the knife. \n[6]I'm telling mom! The knife flashes in the sun as it descends toward the boy. \n[7]He's nuts! I'm telling you-- he's totally lost it. \n[8]Best dad in all the land, everyone! \n[9]He wants to know where you're from. \n[10]Yeah, God just forgot to tell anyone else. we're having a war with someone like every five minutes. \n[11]Here we go again-- \n[12]Okay, what did I tell you-- nuts? \n[13]I'm coming with you. \n[14]You're going to Sodom, right? \n[15]Yeah, whatever.

They always let me in.  Go ahead. \n[20]Hey! Anybody there? Hello? Suddenly Zed and Oh are yanked off their feet from behind and slammed into the wall by helmeted sentries.

Zed and Oh look at each other blankly. \n[12]Thou comest not from the cities of the plain? From Sodom or Gomorrah? Zed perks up at the mention of Sodom, recalling the destination of the soldiers who took Maya and the others. \n[13]The Lord has cursed them for their abomination. \n[14]They bow down before false Gods and worship graven images.

For surely will the Lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within, to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity. \n[18]Accompany me. Abraham sweeps out of the tent.

Zed looks around at his fellow villagers, trying to summon what dignity he has left. ", "ZED AND OH": "\n[1]Woooo! Woooo! Yeah! \n[2]Nape. Not that I remember.

Abraham looks at them. \n[4]Cain? \n[5]Right. \n[6]stare at the spectacle. \n[7]have no idea what's going on. Zed turns to the GUY NEXT TO \n[8]watching curiously. \n[9]They look at each other. Someone has to say something. Finally, Zed clears his throat. ", "SLAVE TRADER": "\n[1]You interested in some slaves? \n[2]You have money? \n[3]Look, pal, money talks and bullshit walks. I don't have time for looky- loos.     Official white                                                                     43. Cain steps up and intercedes. \n[4]All right!
