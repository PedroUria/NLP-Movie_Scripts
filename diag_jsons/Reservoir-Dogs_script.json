{"dialogues": {"EDDIE": "\n[1]I see ya sittin here, but I don't believe it. \n[2]How ya doin, Toothpick? \n[3]I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time. \n[4]That I should've picked you up? \n[5]Oh really, is that a fact? \n[6]Daddy, did ya see that? \n[7]Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me. \n[8]You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it.  But don't try to fuck me.  I don't think of you that way.  I mean, I like you a lot-- \n[9]No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it. \n[10]Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin like a nigger.  It's all that black semen been shootin up his butt.  It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth. \n[11]Really?  Who's your P.O.? \n[12]Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker. \n[13]You're coming back to work for us, right? \n[14]This isn't all that bad.  We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker. \n[15]You don't hafta lift shit.  You don't really work there.  But as far as the records are concerned, you do.  I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy.  You're on the schedule.  You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week.  And ya know dock workers don't do too bad.  So you can move into a halfway decent place without Koons thinkin \"what the fuck.\"  And if Koons ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day.  That day we sent you to Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin up a bunch of shit and bringing it back.  Part of your jab is goin different places - and we got places all over the place. \n[16]Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on. \n[17]--Nuts.  We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now. \n[18]Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just hear it out.  I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys.  He's been gone for four years.  He ain't on no one's list.  Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him. \n[19]Hey Dov, we got a major situation here. I know you know that.  I gotta talk with daddy and find out what he wants done. \n[20]All I know is what Vic told me. He said the place turned into a fuckin bullet festival.  He took a cop as hostage, just to get the fuck out of there. \n[21]Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's fuckin driving around with the cop in his trunk. I don't know who did that.  I don't know who has the loot, if anybody has the loot.  Who's dead, who's alive, who's caught, who's not... I will know, I'm practically there.  But what do I tell these guys about daddy? You sure that's what he said? Okay, that's what I'll tell em. \n[22]Fucking assholes. \n[23]What in Sam Hill is goin on? \n[24]Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up! \n[25]What?  Nobody set anybody up. \n[26]Bullshit. \n[27]Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it? \n[28]And what are your answers?  Was it me?  You think I set you up? \n[29]Nobody did.  You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up. \n[30]I ain't talked to him.  I talked to Dov.  Dov said he's comin out here, and he's fucking pissed. \n[31]Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin chance to breathe.  I got a few questions of my own, ya know. \n[32]I'll call somebody. \n[33]A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think.  I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue? \n[34]Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue? \n[35]I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why the hell are you beating on him? \n[36]Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire.  That don't necessarily make it so.  Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit?  Please tell me somebody brought something with them. \n[37]Well, let's go get it.  We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside. You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop. You two take a car each, I'll follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones.  And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend. \n[38]Why not? \n[39]What does it matter who stays with the cop?  We ain't lettin him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place. \n[40]There is no fuckin set up! Look, this is the news.  Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two.  White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you. \n[41]--We're parked outside. \n[42]He'll be right down. \n[43]I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this.  I've seen it happen. \n[44]Let me tell you guys a story.  In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois. \n[45]Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We called her Lady E. \n[46]No.  She was from Ladora Heights. \n[47]It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once.  You know who she looked like?  Christie Love.  'Member that TV show \"Get Christie Love\"?  She was a black female cop.  She always used to say \"You're under arrest, sugar.\" \n[48]Pam Grier. \n[49]Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her.  So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him \"Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?\"  Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit.  I mean a real animal.  And apparently he would so things to her. \n[50]Nobody knows for sure what he did. We just know he did something. Anyway, Elois plays it real cool. And waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk.  So one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch.  So while the guy's inebriated, she strips him naked. Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly. \n[51]I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put some on his dick and some on his belly, then stuck 'em together. The paramedics had to come and cut it loose. \n[52]I don't know what he did to her, but she got even. \n[53]We woulda gotten here sooner, but we got backed up around La Brea and Pico. \n[54]You know, all things considered, this was pretty successful. \n[55]No, it was messy as hell, but do you realize how much you got away with?  There's over two million dollars worth of diamonds here. \n[56]Hey, what's done is done.  We can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand. \n[57]Hey, it's the best I could do. \n[58]And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll take care of him. \n[59]Ask me how many doctors I called. You wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors I called. \n[60]Fuck you! You gotta little black book, then whip is out.  If not, listen how it is.  I called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit.  Now, time being a factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse.  Told her a bullshit story, upside:  she said bring him to her apartment. \n[61]Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you wanna play that way.  I am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this Bonnie situation.  I don't think she'll call the cops, but I don't know for sure.  But me being too nice- a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk it.  But no fuckin more. I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin her to forget it.  You take care of your friend, you know so much about it. \n[62]I don't need to grow up, my friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm being responsible, I'm taking care of business. \n[63]Yeah, well I don't give a flying fuck what you think! \n[64]Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I leave myself wide open, and I'm an asshole. \n[65]What the fuck happened here? \n[66]Who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig? \n[67]You were saying he went crazy? Something like that?  Worse or better? \n[68]I don't buy it.  It doesn't make sense. \n[69]Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you.  Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram.  That's your story? I'm correct about that, right? \n[70]You're a fuckin liar.  Now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened? \n[71]The man you killed was just released from prison.  He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.  He could've walked away.  All he had to do was say my dad's name.  But instead he shut his mouth and did his time.  He did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man.  And we were very grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off? \n[72]Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me what really happened? \n[73]Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening. \n[74]The motherfucker killed Vic. \n[75]Have you lost your fucking mind? Put your gun down! \n[76]Stop pointing your fuckin gun at daddy! \n[77]Daddy, don't! ", "JOE": "\n[1]Toby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think... think... \n[2]Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl. \n[3]I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age.  Toby what?  What the fuck was her last name? \n[4]Chew?  Toby Chew?  No. \n[5]Wong? \n[6]Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You know, like the Chinese name? \n[7]What the fuck do you think you're doin?  Give me my book back! \n[8]Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now. \n[9]What do you care? \n[10]Give me my book. \n[11]I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it. \n[12]No, she did it.  She killed the cheatin wife, too. \n[13]No, we're gonna be hittin it. I'll take care of the check. \n[14]Sure thing. \n[15]I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip. And when I come back, I want my book back. \n[16]Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya? \n[17]Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling.  Wait a minute, who didn't throw in? \n[18]Mr. White? Why? \n[19]He don't tip? You don't tip?  Why? \n[20]He don't believe in it? You don't believe in it? \n[21]Shut up! Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast. \n[22]Whatever.  Just throw in your dollar, and let's move. See what I'm dealing with here. Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with infants. \n[23]Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry about it.  You had a bad couple of months, it happens. Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're embarrassing me.  I don't need to be told what I already know.  When you have bad months, you do what every business man in the worlds does, I don't care if he's Donald Trump or Irving the tailor. Ya ride it out. \n[24]Come in. \n[25]Tell him to come in. \n[26]Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I gotta go. Good enough, bye. \n[27]How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin good, ain't it? \n[28]Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy Martin? \n[29]Take a seat. \n[30]Who's your parole officer? \n[31]How is he? \n[32]Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer.  But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin prick. \n[33]What the hell did you expect me to do?  Just forget about you? \n[34]It's the least I could do Vic.  I wish I coulda done more. Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a story?  What're your plans? \n[35]Come in. \n[36]Eddie, I hate like hell for you to hear it this way.  But when Vic asked me how's business, well, you don't lie to a man who's just done four years in the slammer for ya. \n[37]Okay, okay, enough, enough! Playtime's over!  You wanna roll around on the floor, do it in Eddie's office, not mine! \n[38]What? \n[39]Are you two finished?  We were talkin about some serious shit when you came in Eddie.  We got a big problem we're tryin to solve. Now Eddie, would you like to sit down and help us solve it, or do you two wanna piss fart around? \n[40]Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a parole problem. \n[41]We can work this out, can't we? \n[42]Didn't I tell ya not to worry? Vic was worried. \n[43]Well, it's kinda a strange time right now.  Things are kinda-- \n[44]Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach.  Give ya some cash, get that Koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya. \n[45]How would you feel about pullin a heist with about five other guys? \n[46]Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough two minutes.  It's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd.  But you have the fellas to deal with the crowd.  It's a jewelry store. They're getting a big shipment of South African diamonds on a certain day.  They're like a way station.  It's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Hamburg. When you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones. The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em.  Nobody knows anybody else.  Nobody's connected. I don't use connected guys for this shit. \n[47]Juicy, man, real juicy. \n[48]You're picking the buyer up at the train station?  You're carrying the weed on you? \n[49]...So they're talkin about how they get their wives off, and the French guys says: \"All I gotta do is take my pinky and tickle my Fifi's little oo la la  and she rises a foot off the bed.\" So the dago says: \n[50]\"That's nothin.  When I take the tip of my tongue and wiggle it against my Mary Louise's little fun pimple, she rises two feet off da bed.\"  Then our friend from Poland says: \"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When I get through fuckin my Sophie, I wipe my dick on the curtains and you know what?  She hits the roof!\" \n[51]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! \n[52]Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on the drapes. \n[53]You're here, great! \n[54]No hurry. All right, let's get to know one another.  With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed.  You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done.  Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do.  This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself.  And that's the way I like it.  Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with.  You don't know any names.  You know my name, you know Eddie's name.  That I don't care about.  You gotta prove it.  I ain't worried.  Besides, this way you gotta trust me.  I like that.  I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you.  I know you.  I know your work, I know your reputation.  I know you as men.  Except for this guy. \n[55]But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly. Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink. \n[56]Cause you're a faggot. \n[57]I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down.  So forget it, I pick.  Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow. \n[58]You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink. \n[59]Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting!  Listen up Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here, my way or the highway.  And you can go down either of 'em.  So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink? \n[60]Okay fellas, let's get into this. \n[61]This man set us up. \n[62]That's okay, Eddie, I do. \n[63]That piece of shit.  Workin with the cops. \n[64]I said this lump of shit is workin with the LAPD. \n[65]Aren't you? \n[66]Like hell I am. \n[67]You don't know jack shit.  I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed. \n[68]Dead as Dillinger. \n[69]He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on.  I should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when I wasn't a hundred percent.  But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up. \n[70]You don't need proof when you got instinct.  I ignored it before, but not no more. \n[71]Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot.  We like each other too much. \n[72]Larry, I'm gonna kill him. \n[73]Larry, I'm askin you to trust me on this. \n[74]I'm not askin, I'm betting. ", "FREDDY": "\n[1]Say \"hello\" to a motherfucker who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team? \n[2]It ain't no joke, I'm in there. I'm up his ass. \n[3]Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.  He says I should just hang around my apartment and wait for a phone call.  Well after waiting three goddamn days by the fuckin phone, he calls me last night and says Joe's ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen minutes. \n[4]Nice Guy.  When we got to the bar... \n[5]The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony name.  My name's Mr. Orange. \n[6]Who, Mr. White? \n[7]No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well. \n[8]The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies. \n[9]Me and Mr. White? \n[10]A little. \n[11]The Brewers. \n[12]Yeah.  They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em. \n[13]Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that. \n[14]He asked me if I ever done armed robbery before.  I read him my credits.  I robbed a few gas and sips, sold some weed, told him recently I held the shotgun while me and another guy pulled down a poker game in Portland. \n[15]Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good, too. \n[16]What's this? \n[17]What? \n[18]But what is this? \n[19]What? \n[20]I gotta memorize all this shit? \n[21]I can do that. \n[22]...this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of '86.  I still had a connection.  Which was insane, 'cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my friends knew it.  And they'd give me a call and say, \"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?\" They knew I smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a little for them when I was buyin.  But it got to be everytime I bought some weed, I was buyin for four or five different people.  Finally I said, \"Fuck this shit.\"  I'm makin this bitch rich.  She didn't have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people.  I was fuckin doin all the work.  So I got together with her and told her, \"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm comin through for everybody, and nobody's comin through for me. So, either I'm gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, I'll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and I get my pot for free.\"  So, I did if for awhile... \n[23]...but then that got to be a pain in the ass.  People called me on the phone all the fuckin time.  I couldn't rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some?\"  \"Motherfucker, I'm tryin to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have some, I'll let you know.\"  And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there's my friends and everything, but still.  I got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags.  Well, they don't want sixty dollars worth.  They want ten dollars worth.  Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I don't even know how much ten dollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck, man, I don't want that much around.  If I have that much around I'll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem. You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it.\" Finally I just told my connection, count me out.  But as it turns out, I'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. But I was still sick to death of it.  And she's trying to talk me into not quitin. Now this was a very weird situation, 'cause I don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought. Nobody and anything.  People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months.  And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it.  So I told her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore.  But I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends.  She agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend.  She had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone... \n[24]...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly. \n[25]Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail.  She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed.  Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin me, keeps askin me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it.  Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station. \n[26]Yeah, the guy needed it right away.  Don't ask me why.  So we get to the train station, and we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm carrying the weed in one of those carry-on bags, and I gotta take a piss.  So I tell the connection I'll be right back, I'm goin' to the little boys room... \n[27]...So I walk into the men's room, and who's standing there? \n[28]...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and a German Shepherd. \n[29]No.  They were just a bunch of cops hangin out in the men's room, talkin.  When I walked through the door they all stopped what they were talking about and looked at me. \n[30]The German Shepherd starts barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I mean it's obvious he's barkin' at me. \n[31]Every nerve ending, all of my senses, the blood in my veins, everything I has was screaming, \"Take off, man, just take off, get the fuck outta there!\"  Panic hit me like a bucket of water.  First there was the shock of it--BAM, right in the face!  Then I'm just standin there drenched in panic. \n[32]And all those sheriffs are lookin at me and they know. They can smell it.  As sure as that fuckin dog cam, they can smell it on me. \n[33]That's him, that's Mr. White. \n[34]What was it? \n[35]Goddamn, that's hard time. \n[36]When did he do this time? \n[37]They couldn't pin the killing on one of the bank robbers? \n[38]And Larry Dimick was one of the boys? \n[39]Today they may know something, tomorrow they may know something else.  But yesterday they didn't know anything. \n[40]What's the next step? \n[41]Hello. \n[42]I'll be right down. \n[43]Don't pussy out on me now.  They don't know.  They don't know shit. You're not gonna get hurt.  You're fucking Baretta and they believe every word, cuz you're super cool. \n[44]Do things?  What would he do?  You mean like beat her up? \n[45]You can do some crazy things with it. \n[46]What's your visibility of the interior? \n[47]This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety. \n[48]Oh this is great.  You ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever.  But you are giving me an attitude. \n[49]I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it. I'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is! \n[50]Isn't this risk unorthodox? \n[51]Letting them go ahead with the robbery? \n[52]That's out.  They know the faces of who works what shift. \n[53]I stand outside and guard the door.  I don't let anybody come in or go out. \n[54]Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store. \n[55]Crowd control.  They handle customers and employees in the display area. \n[56]You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds.  We're there for those stones, period.  Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off.  We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer.  What if the manager won't give up the diamonds? \n[57]You're not blind, there's just blood in your eyes. \n[58]I'm sorry. \n[59]I'm sorry.  I can't believe she killed me... ", "HOLDAWAY": "\n[1]This better not be some Freddy joke. \n[2]Congratulations. \n[3]Woo all picked you up? \n[4]...What bar? \n[5]You ever seen this motherfucker before? \n[6]Yeah. \n[7]How can you tell? \n[8]Did the two of you talk? \n[9]Yeah. \n[10]What about? \n[11]The Milwaukee Brewers? \n[12]Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face. \n[13]What kinds questions did Cabot ask? \n[14]Didja use the commode story? \n[15]It's a scene.  Memorize it. \n[16]A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando.  To do this job you got to be a great actor.  You got to be naturalistic.  You got to be naturalistic as hell.  If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bull shit in this job. \n[17]It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal. \n[18]Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job. \n[19]It's like a joke.  You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own.  The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it, and sayin it. \n[20]The things you gotta remember are the details.  It's the details that sell your story.  Now this story takes place in this men's room.  So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands.  You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors.  You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it.  And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you. \n[21]Lawrence Dimick.  Let's see what we got on him. \n[22]Was this vice squad bullshit in Milwaukee? \n[23]What happened? \n[24]Just how sure are you with your cover? \n[25]Do what they told ya.  Sit in your apartment and wait for 'em to call you.  We'll have guys posted outside who'll follow you when they pick you up. \n[26]Okay, we're gonna station men across the street from Karina's Fine Jewelry.  But their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control.  You gotta make sure they don't have to move in.  You're inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle.  We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous.  They got complete visibility of the exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot shows up, we'll see it. \n[27]We can't see shit on the inside. And we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us. \n[28]What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job too tough for ya?  No one lied to you.  You always knew we'd hang back until Joe Cabot showed up. \n[29]Since when does an undercover cop have protection?  Freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now.  I understand you're nervous.  I wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't.  We have to make do with the cards we're dealt. \n[30]I don't mean to be harsh with ya, but I've found tough love works best in these situations.  We have to get Joe Cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. We don't care about these other bastards.  We're willing to offer them good deals to testify against Cabot. \n[31]What? \n[32]The whole idea behind this operation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed.  We bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit. Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs are very clean.  We got people surrounding the perimeter.  We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings.  We could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off. \n[33]These guys are professionals. We're professionals.  It's a risk, but I think it's a calculated risk. ", "VIC": "\n[1]It's a change. \n[2]Sure. \n[3]A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons. \n[4]Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house. \n[5]I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside. \n[6]I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot. \n[7]Well, what I wanna do is go back to work.  But I got this Koons prick deep up my ass.  He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again. \n[8]Fine, now. \n[9]Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin about. \n[10]No.  That your head's been up your ass.  I walk through the door and Joe says \"Vic, you're back, thank god.  Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing.  Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up.\"  And I say \"Well, Joe, I coulda told you that.\"  \"I'm ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin toilet!\" I'm not tellin tales out of school.  You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself. \n[11]You fuckin wish. \n[12]Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew. \n[13]I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound. \n[14]Craig Koons. \n[15]He is a motherfucker.  He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. \n[16]I wanna.  But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to- goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own.  I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin back before ten o'clock curfew. \n[17]I don't wanna lift crates. \n[18]That's great, guy, thanks a bunch. When do you think you'll need me for real work? \n[19]What's the exposure like? \n[20]What's the cut? ", "NICE GUY EDDIE": "\n[1]You don't remember \"True Blue?\" That was a big ass hit for Madonna.  Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of \"True Blue.\" \n[2]Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend? \n[3]Can you believe the songs they been playin? \n[4]When I was coming down here, I was playin it.  And \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\" came on.  Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times.  I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy. \n[5]I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy. \n[6]I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before.  I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife. \n[7]Okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady. \n[8]C'mon, throw in a buck. \n[9]Whaddaya mean you don't tip? \n[10]You don't believe in tipping? \n[11]I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that.  So let's get this straight. You never ever tip? \n[12]I'd go over twelve percent for that. \n[13]Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee. \n[14]Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard-- \n[15]--It is that too.  But it's also he couldn't get a waiter job.  You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: \"Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips.\" \n[16]They were waiting for you? \n[17]It's time.  Grab your jacket-- ", "JODIE": "\n[1]This is your life, Lawrence Dimick! \n[2]Lawrence \"Larry\" Dimick.  Also known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin \"Al\" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe- Armed-Robbery.  He's a pro and he makes it a habit not to get caught. \n[3]He's only been convicted twice, which is pretty good for somebody living a life of crime.  Once for armed robbery, when he was twenty- one, in Milwaukee. \n[4]\n[5]Payroll office at a lumber yard. First offense - he got eighteen months.  He didn't get busted again until he was thirty-two. And then it was a backdoor bust. A routine vice squad roust.  They roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence is in there knocking down a few. He gets picked up.  He's wearing on his person an outlaw .45 automatic, apparently his weapon of choice.  Also, on his finger is a diamond ring from a jewelry store robbery a year earlier.  He got two years back inside for that. \n[6]\n[7]So far, it's the only time he's ever done. \n[8]\n[9]No.  The vice squad roust was in L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles since '77. \n[10]Back in '83, got out late '86.  I found something else out I think you two should be aware of. About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job.  Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop. Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party.  The door opens, everyone yells \"Surprise!\", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody knows what's going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two .45 automatics into the crowd. \n[11]It was a mess.  Cops got hit, wives got hit, girlfriends got hit, his dog got hit.  People got glass in their faces.  Three were killed, six were wounded. \n[12]They tried, but they didn't have a positive I.D. and all those guys had alibis.  Besides, we really didn't have anything on them.  We had the testimony of a dead man that they were talking about committing a robbery.  They never went ahead with the bank job. \n[13]He was probably the one.
