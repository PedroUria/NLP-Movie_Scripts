Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron... \n[45]What? \n[46]The coach from USC is going to be at the championship. \n[47]Chances are there's still a chance. \n[48]Hey. \n[49]No. \n[50]There's so many I just can't keep track. \n[51]Give it yourself. \n[52]Hey, Mr. M. \n[53]Way to hoop. \n[54]A ride home. \n[55]Look, big head, I'll be at your car. \n[56]Please. \n[57]Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you. \n[58]\"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've been wanting to get with you.  Let me take you to the Spring Dance and I promise I'll leave you satisfied.\" \n[59]What a ho. \n[60]She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail. \n[61]And?  She's not saying, \"I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better,\" she's saying, \"I wanna bone.\" \n[62]Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything. \n[63]I don't. \n[64]Who's Spalding? \n[65]Fuck you, Quincy. \n[66]Who said I'm not getting recruited? \n[67]I'm not the one who put this scar here. \n[68]When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose. \n[69]Would you watch the damn road? \n[70]I'm warning you, don't tempt me. \n[71]Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.

A ball player. \n[72]Didn't know you cared so much. \n[73]Good. \n[74]No. \n[75]Always on my ass, anyway. \n[76]Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you... \n[77]Ow!!! \n[78]No one's forcing her. \n[79]Ow!!!  Okay! \n[80]Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker. \n[81]Found?  I'm not some charity case. \n[82]Mom tell you to do this? \n[83]Damn, Lena... Who is he? \n[84]He's in college? \n[85]How'd you get him to say yes? \n[86]Oh, great. \n[87]Yeah, right. \n[88]I don't know how to walk in heels. \n[89]You ever been in love? \n[90]They ever love you back? \n[91]Sorry. I'm leaving. \n[92]I can't eat before a game. \n[93]You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say. \n[94]What? \n[95]No! \n[96]That's bullsh--! \n[97]I don't even want to go.  \n[98]What? \n[99]You really think I look beautiful? \n[100]You're cold? \n[101]Oh, sorry. \n[102]Yeah. \n[103]You either. \n[104]Guess we'll see you later. \n[105]Gym. \n[106]Sort of. \n[107]Huh? \n[108]Sorry. \n[109]My mouth is kinda dry. \n[110]Hey. \n[111]Yeah. \n[112]He ain't Spalding. \n[113]So you took Shawnee, huh? \n[114]Sure. \n[115]Freshman year, my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent, cause I was shooting it like a jump shot. \n[116]Um...but then sophomore year I was shooting seventy-five percent from the line. \n[117]...uh, by keeping my feet set and really following through. \n[118]Uh-huh. \n[119]Wait... \n[120]Psst. \n[121]Early night for you, isn't it? \n[122]Mulholland Drive. \n[123]So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit? \n[124]Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied. \n[125]Why? \n[126]I was sitting in Jason's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause I couldn't remember how many offensive boards I had in the championship.  And then I guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls. \n[127]What? \n[128]Hold up for a second. \n[129]It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...? \n[130]I knew it. \n[131]I know, right? \n[132]I can take it. \n[133]Coach hates me, doesn't she? \n[134]What's up with that? \n[135]Thanks, Sidra. \n[136]You finish the reading for E-con? \n[137]What'd it say? \n[138]Whatever, big head. \n[139]You do see me standing here, right? \n[140]Fine, Quincy. \n[141]I said fine. \n[142]Quit. \n[143]You're such a punk. \n[144]Always. \n[145]What? \n[146]Coach... \n[147]I was just playing ball. \n[148]Didn't have to try very hard. \n[149]What? \n[150]I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me. \n[151]I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me. \n[152]That was so weak. \n[153]That's what you get. \n[154]What are we playing for? \n[155]What? \n[156]Give me the ball. \n[157]Kiss my booty. \n[158]All's fair in love and basketball. Strip. \n[159]Too bad you got your mama's height, huh. \n[160]Yo, where's the \"D\"? \n[161]I won. \n[162]I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you. \n[163]She understands. \n[164]You're not stupid. \n[165]Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm? \n[166]I...can't. \n[167]Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up. \n[168]I mean, I can stay a few more minutes. \n[169]Quincy... \n[170]Will you call me when you get in? \n[171]I shouldn't have left. \n[172]You should have seen him, Shay... \n[173]What? \n[174]Kiss my ass. \n[175]Sandra, please, last time you chest- bumped me, it took you three tries. \n[176]Yo, T, why you so quiet? \n[177]Thanks. \n[178]I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game. \n[179]Yeah.

What was I supposed to do? \n[217]If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting! \n[218]I never asked you to choose. \n[219]I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you. \n[220]How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you. \n[221]What? \n[222]How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this. \n[223]You don't think so? \n[224]You're what? \n[225]When did you decide all this? \n[226]So that's it, just forget about us? \n[227]Friends. \n[228]Uh huh. \n[229]Oye. \n[230]Oye, Luisa. \n[231]Si.  Large game. \n[232]What did he say? \n[233]What's up, Sidra. \n[234]How do you say \"you're dreaming\" in Italian? \n[235]You mean my championship trophy?  My bad. \n[236]Uno mas, por favor. \n[237]Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden. \n[238]Just like that? \n[239]How's that been? \n[240]Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else.  I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old \"Dif'rent Strokes\" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, \"What you talking bout, Willis?\" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass. \n[241]I wouldn't know. \n[242]Just not my type, I guess. \n[243]You ever think about going back? \n[244]I'm sorry. \n[245]So, how you doing? \n[246]I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in. \n[247]No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool. \n[248]Shouldn't you be lying down, or... \n[249]I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL. \n[250]What are the doctors saying? \n[251]I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve. \n[252]I forgot, \"Q-man.\" \n[253]We won the championship. \n[254]Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical. \n[255]Kiss my ass. \n[256]I can't believe it's been five years. \n[257]Oh yeah? \n[258]Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up. \n[259]Actually, I don't... \n[260]I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile. \n[261]Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know? \n[262]Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations. \n[263]I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great. Well...I should go. \n[264]Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything. \n[265]Hey. \n[266]Need any help? \n[267]Yeah.  Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy. \n[268]Engaged. \n[269]Yeah, you met her? \n[270]Maybe she is. \n[271]So what do I do? \n[272]Whatever. \n[273]I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy. \n[274]There you go. \n[275]So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a \"dumb\" jump shot? \n[276]No I don't. \n[277]I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume. \n[278]Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not. \n[279]I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart. \n[280]That's not it. \n[281]I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge. \n[282]I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that. \n[283]What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers. \n[284]I'm sorry. \n[285]That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two. \n[286]It mattered, Mom. \n[287]Dad.  What are you doing here? \n[288]That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter. \n[289]You know. \n[290]You shoot like a girl. \n[291]And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops... \n[292]It's good!  It's good! \n[293]You visiting? \n[294]Who's this guy I always see her around? \n[295]So...how's the knee? \n[296]Strong enough to get you down the aisle? \n[297]That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy. \n[298]It just isn't. \n[299]You had a rough couple years, that's all. \n[300]And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough. \n[301]You're serious. \n[302]Like what? \n[303]Wow. \n[304]It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way. \n[305]Why do you keep asking me that? \n[306]Something was just missing. \n[307]It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone. \n[308]What are you talking about? \n[309]We need to talk. \n[310]Please. \n[311]You asked me what was missing. \n[312]From basketball. \n[313]It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing. \n[314]What I'm trying to say is -- \n[315]What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away. \n[316]I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago. \n[317]Then why are you so upset? \n[318]Better late than never, right? \n[319]I'll play you. \n[320]One game.  One-on-one. \n[321]Your heart. \n[322]So you're gonna bitch up? \n[323]I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you. \n[324]Prove it. \n[325]You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to. \n[326]So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you. \n[327]If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present. \n[328]Check. \n[329]One, zip.  Check. \n[330]Nine, up.  Point. \n[331]Check.

He wouldn't lie. \n[170]What...what's this? \n[171]Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something... \n[172]What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense... \n[173]He even had me wanting to play for the \"Clippers.\"  Man, how stupid am I. \n[174]I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this... \n[175]What? \n[176]I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright? \n[177]Why not? \n[178]Didn't realize you were watching the clock. \n[179]Nah.  Don't sweat it. \n[180]For real.  I should be alone, anyway. \n[181]What's up? \n[182]Here I am. \n[183]It happens, right... \n[184]I heard. \n[185]Nah. \n[186]Where's the keg at? \n[187]That's funny. \n[188]You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball? \n[189]Excuse me. \n[190]Guess you didn't see the game. \n[191]What's your name? \n[192]\n[193]Nobody. \n[194]Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go? \n[195]Not really. \n[196]You know what, I'm just gonna crash. \n[197]Nah.  I have curfew. \n[198]Oh, by the way.  Congratulations. \n[199]What are you doing here? \n[200]Still is, so let yourself out. \n[201]We ain't got nothing to talk about. \n[202]Lucky kid. \n[203]And some things should never fucking happen! \n[204]I ain't a damn liar. \n[205]So now you're saying my mother trapped you? \n[206]Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro. \n[207]From your mouth. \n[208]Always thought \"can't\" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. \n[209]Hey, what's up. \n[210]Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy. \n[211]You win? \n[212]The \"man\" again. \n[213]Hey, you. \n[214]Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry. \n[215]We're going to get some food. \n[216]Can we talk? \n[217]I just took the ho to Burger King, alright. \n[218]Least she had time for me. \n[219]I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. \n[220]You forgot to be there. \n[221]Stay! \n[222]Least you got your priorities straight. \n[223]Never had to. \n[224]Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale. \n[225]Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright. \n[226]I'm not asking for us to be together. \n[227]I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for. \n[228]I don't think so. \n[229]Look, I'm entering the draft. \n[230]I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know? \n[231]Few days ago. \n[232]Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me. \n[233]But, you know, I'd still like us to be friends. \n[234]So...I guess I'll see you around. \n[235]What do you want? \n[236]After five years. \n[237]Look, I'm busy. \n[238]I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? \n[239]Good. \n[240]And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  \"I told you so?\" \n[241]Yeah. \n[242]You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me? \n[243]Monica? \n[244]Alright.  I heard you were in Spain. \n[245]Just something I'm trying. \n[246]Thanks. \n[247]I'm alright.  But you can sit. \n[248]Yup. \n[249]A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months. \n[250]Not for Quincy McCall. \n[251]So, how's pro-ball, Europe? \n[252]Still working on being the first girl in the NBA? \n[253]Funny.  I never did. \n[254]Tried calling you a couple times. \n[255]Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again. \n[256]Figured it was something like that. \n[257]So, when do you go back? \n[258]What do you mean? \n[259]A rest? \n[260]No. \n[261]It's okay. \n[262]I'm gonna be okay. \n[263]Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh... \n[264]This is Kyra.  My fiance. \n[265]It means a lot that you came by. \n[266]Thanks. \n[267]Damn, girl. \n[268]I don't wanna see that. \n[269]Brother's gonna have to start locking doors. \n[270]So how long is this trip? \n[271]Nah. \n[272]You might be the only one with a job. \n[273]Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? \n[274]I don't know sometimes. \n[275]A horse? \n[276]I remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress. \n[277]Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company. \n[278]Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny. \n[279]Getting there. \n[280]Yeah.  Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you... \n[281]Can I ask you something? \n[282]You never told me why ball isn't fun anymore. \n[283]Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too. \n[284]That a nice way of saying I rode the bench? \n[285]Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that... \n[286]Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else. \n[287]Maybe go back to school. \n[288]I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking. \n[289]So why'd you give up ball? \n[290]Cause I don't get it. \n[291]What? \n[292]Find. \n[293]What's going on? \n[294]Hold on. \n[295]What? \n[296]you woke me up to tell me that? \n[297]I heard enough. \n[298]We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? \n[299]You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't. \n[300]Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. \n[301]Wrong. \n[302]What? \n[303]For what? \n[304]You're out of your mind. \n[305]What's that supposed to be, psychology? \n[306]Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on. \n[307]What will this prove? \n[308]So? \n[309]And what happens when you lose? \n[310]One, five.  Check. \n[311]All's fair in love and basketball, right? \n[312]Hey. \n[313]Double or nothing. \n[314]Let's go, McCall! \n[315]Go Mommy.

This was really nice of you. \n[6]Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta. \n[7]Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about. \n[8]Really?  Well, come on, then. \n[9]Honey, put this in the kitchen. \n[10]Monica, what did you do? \n[11]Oh, all that work. \n[12]I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage. \n[13]Child, pick up your lip. \n[14]Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear? \n[15]When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth? \n[16]I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day. \n[17]The blue. \n[18]Okay. \n[19]The boy next door is riding with you to school so you'll know somebody your first day. Hurry so she can go to sleep. \n[20]...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour. \n[21]So that means it's alright for you to act like that? \n[22]I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing. \n[23]That's not funny \n[24]Watch your mouth. \n[25]If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head.  I mean, why walk around with your hair looking like \"whodunit\"...? \n[26]Monica, please. \n[27]Taste this. \n[28]Child, take a bite. \n[29]I found some apricot chutney and mixed it with the yams. \n[30]Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do. \n[31]Nothing.  So good luck. \n[32]Go in my top drawer and get my pearls. \n[33]You okay? \n[34]Well, can you promise me one thing? \n[35]Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that? \n[36]Monica.  What are you doing here? \n[37]Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you. \n[38]He's still at the bank. \n[39]Everything okay? \n[40]Well, I'm going to get dinner. \n[41]It's just a game. \n[42]Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game. \n[43]Hi. \n[44]I can manage. \n[45]Your sister's bringing the baby over. You should try to be here. \n[46]How is he? \n[47]To that stewardess? \n[48]His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me. \n[49]I thought you were over him. \n[50]Find out where they're registered and send them a gift. \n[51]You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask? \n[52]Don't curse. \n[53]What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too \"prissy\" for you, too bad. \n[54]You're the one always turning your nose up at me. \n[55]Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say. \n[56]What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you? \n[57]So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume? \n[58]Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife. \n[59]Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know. \n[60]I don't remember that. \n[61]That's ridiculous. \n[62]Dammitt, Monica! \n[63]Is that really all you think of me? \n[64]When I married your father, all I wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so I could start my catering business.  And then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I got pregnant with you.  And I put it out of my mind because that's what you did. \n[65]But you want to know what day I remember? In high school, you getting ready for the Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around your neck, told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have a catering business to run off to.  My family had three meals a day, had someone to pick up after them, and when my daughters went to a dance, I helped them get ready.  That's what I came to care about. \n[66]You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games. \n[67]So you're still breast-feeding? \n[68]You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold. \n[69]Okay. \n[70]God.  \"Grandma.\" \n[71]You know, I'd probably be a lot more \"prissy\" in the situation than you'd like, but the thing I always admired that drove me crazy, was the fight you had in you. \n[72]When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you. ", "ZEKE": "\n[1]Girl, who you trying to fool? \n[2]See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn. \n[3]Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word? \n[4]Why not? \n[5]That's right. \n[6]What? Oh, and, uh, don't say \"shit.\" \n[7]Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting. \n[8]Business folks. \n[9]Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us. \n[10]Later, Quincy. \n[11]Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball. \n[12]Gotta wait til the press conference. \n[13]I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it. \n[14]We should have another talk with Coach Carril at Princeton. \n[15]I don't care about the team.  I care about the school. \n[16]You played good.  I was proud of you. \n[17]I don't wanna hurt your feelings. \n[18]Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late. \n[19]Let's hope I can say the same about you one day. \n[20]Hey, Miss Baller. \n[21]I had some players to see and hands to shake. \n[22]I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude. \n[23]Yeah. \n[24]I have. \n[25]No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my \"bullshit\" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. \n[26]Keep your voice down. \n[27]Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for my kid. \n[28]Didn't need a cross-over to post you up. \n[29]What people? \n[30]Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree. \n[31]You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere. \n[32]Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice. \n[33]Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with. \n[34]there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit. \n[35]Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you. \n[36]I just told you. \n[37]You got the balls to ask me that? \n[38]No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true. \n[39]I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle. \n[40]A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the \"Clips.\"  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me. \n[41]We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out. I'm giving her some space, couple days... \n[42]Your door was unlocked. \n[43]We need to talk. \n[44]I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father. \n[45]Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen. \n[46]Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me? \n[47]Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage. \n[48]I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you. \n[49]What? \n[50]Quincy, you'd be making the biggest mistake of your life. \n[51]I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. \n[52]Nona. \n[53]How's he doing? \n[54]What's that, not great? \n[55]Nona, please. \n[56]Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been? \n[57]Hey, son. \n[58]Well, you made SportsCenter. \n[59]Came by to check on you. \n[60]Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. \n[61]I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. \n[62]No. \n[63]Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. \n[64]You want me to fuck off? \n[65]Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. \n[66]You're a better ballplayer than I ever was.  But you got a lot of other things going for you.  You're smart.  I always felt...I always knew that you could do anything you wanted.  You want to be a ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know you ain't like everybody else on that court.  You ain't like I was.  You got options.

Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then... \n[10]Okay? \n[11]It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook. \n[12]You're a caterer? \n[13]You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house. \n[14]Help her, Quincy. \n[15]It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel? \n[16]No.  Good boy. \n[17]What is this? \n[18]I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor. \n[19]Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls. \n[20]I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs. \n[21]You hearing me? \n[22]How was your game? \n[23]Still the man. \n[24]Where's your dad? \n[25]Later when? \n[26]At one in the morning? \n[27]I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job. \n[28]I didn't mean it like that. \n[29]I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him... \n[30]You said you'd think about going back to get your degree. \n[31]Fine, then how many nights home is that? \n[32]How about now?  I got a week yet? \n[33]You scared me. \n[34]I'm fine. \n[35]Guess he talked to you. \n[36]Whose truth are you talking about? \n[37]Just...leave it alone. \n[38]Quincy, please... \n[39]Guess I should have been telling your father. \n[40]I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that? After all his late nights and \"meetings\" and I still needed proof. \n[41]I used to think I was lucky just to be married to Zeke McCall, but I'm too tired. \n[42]Not great. \n[43]The doctor'll be back in a minute. \n[44]He tore his ACL. \n[45]Happy.

They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me. \n[26]Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years. \n[27]It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad \"The American\" was making more money.

", "COACH MILLER": "\n[1]I don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because I'm still being nice to you. \n[2]But my philosophy is simple. Hard work and sacrifice. There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player.  Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player.  What you were doesn't matter anymore.  For the first time in your life, you won't be the best. You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined.  So the question is, how will you respond?  Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it, \"There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything.\" \n[3]A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on time, no exceptions.  Attend every class, no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant.  And finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right Sidra? \n[4]By the end of this year some of you will hate me... \n[5]Some of you will want to go home... \n[6]But I guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people. \n[7]Let's go, freshmen, you're getting spanked! \n[8]Monica, I'm putting you on my Wizard of Oz team.  No brains, no courage and no heart! \n[9]Way to work, Zvette. \n[10]Get lower, Monica, move your feet. \n[11]I said lower! \n[12]This is low, got it?  Offense sells tickets, defense wins games! \n[13]Monica, you trying to tell me you can't take a little challenge? \n[14]This time get your feet set. \n[15]Next! \n[16]Sidra!  You feel like playing any \"D\"? \n[17]Monica!  Get over here. \n[18]While you're so busy posing, your man just scored! \n[19]Show me again. \n[20]You love to pose so much, let's see it again. \n[21]I want you to stand like that for the rest of practice. \n[22]I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me? Dora, take her spot. \n[23]That's it, that's it! \n[24]Monica. \n[25]You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart. \n[26]We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again. \n[27]You want the job or not? \n[28]What? \n[29]You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry. Go get dressed. \n[30]Sidra. ", "JASON": "\n[1]Can I take your coat? \n[2]No, I mean I can check it for you. \n[3]Your sister wasn't lying. \n[4]What's up, Black.  I'm Jason. \n[5]So, you like school? \n[6]Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't remember sisters being as fine as you, though. \n[7]So what do you like studying? \n[8]I'm an English major.  You like English? \n[9]Careful. \n[10]That was two words. \n[11]Girl, how come you're so stressed? \n[12]I mean, I'm having a good time with you... \n[13]So tell me what I have to do to make you have a good time with me. \n[14]Then I'll get you some punch. \n[15]Just don't jet while I'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind. \n[16]There we go. \n[17]You want to dance? \n[18]That was nice. \n[19]Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself... \n[20]Shh.  It's okay. ", "NATHAN": "\n[1]How are you feeling, munchkin? \n[2]Yeah, you're through. \n[3]She's alright. \n[4]Camille, she'll be fine. \n[5]Which one for tomorrow? \n[6]You sure? \n[7]Can you iron both tonight just in case? \n[8]Thanks, sweetheart. \n[9]And what am I supposed to say to the man? \n[10]You lost your head. \n[11]Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball. \n[12]You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality. \n[13]I know.  But chances are... \n[14]Hey, munchkin. \n[15]I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you. \n[16]So how's the job going? \n[17]I think I know what the problem is. \n[18]There. \n[19]I'll take that as a compliment. ", "KYRA": "\n[1]I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me. \n[2]Why are you up?  Get in bed. \n[3]Tell me you're going to be okay. \n[4]Hello. \n[5]Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you. \n[6]Thank you. \n[7]Yes, we appreciate that. \n[8]What? \n[9]Get used to it, babe. \n[10]Four days. \n[11]So are you going to be the kind of husband who won't let his wife work? \n[12]Why not? \n[13]Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it. \n[14]To do what you love. \n[15]You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse. \n[16]Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive. You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on. ", "SHAWNEE": "\n[1]Hey, girl. \n[2]Your hair looks so cute like that. \n[3]So...you know who Q's asking to the Spring Dance? \n[4]C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping? \n[5]Well, can you give him this for me? \n[6]I don't wanna look fast. Thanks, girl. \n[7]Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want to lick the sweat off it. \n[8]Q, I like this song... \n[9]Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made dresses. ", "ANGLE ON": "\n[1]Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor, and abruptly stops.  He stares at Monica in shock. \n[2]Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit.  She quickly steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face. \n[3]Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax. Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows. Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't. Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight. Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his hands lower down Shawnee's back.  The music continues... \n[4]Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves back outside. \n[5]Laker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ. \n[6]Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY- \n[7]Chick and Stu. \n[8]Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of him. \n[9]Camille watches from the kitchen window ", "SHAYLA": "\n[1]Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause she's bow-legged. \n[2]Go to sleep. \n[3]Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you got the start.  But you get caught breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send your ass back to the bench.  You'll see your man tomorrow. \n[4]Yo sis, what's going on? \n[5]What's up, superstar. Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you? \n[6]She also tell you she ganked the starting spot from Sidra? \n[7]Balcony. \n[8]Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a ho. \n[9]Sure.
