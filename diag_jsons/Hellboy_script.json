Abe loves them. \n[36]Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe. \"Unique.\" That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here. \n[37]As you entered the lobby there was an inscription -- \n[38]Impressive. Do you remember what it said? \n[39]\"In the absence of light, darkness prevails.\" For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers. We are the ones who bump back. \n[40]1937: Hitler joins \"The Thule Society\" -- a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult. \n[41]1938: he acquires the Spear of Longinus, which pierced the body of Christ. He who holds it becomes invincible. \n[42]Hitler's power increases tenfold. \n[43]In 1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back. THE BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE is born. \n[44]1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies. \n[45]Did he, now? \n[46]Agent Myers, this is Agent Clay. Follow his lead. \n[47]I hand-picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates. Make me proud. \n[48]Apparently not everything was fake. \n[49]A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite. \n[50]Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow -- \n[51]A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy. \n[52]I thought you liked being on TV. \n[53]Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner. \n[54]He's just going through a phase -- \n[55]I know where to find him. I'll get him back. \n[56]Show me, Abe... show me. \n[57]I don't want Hellboy to know -- \n[58]Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to destroy the world. And they are back -- in my lifetime, they are back. To finish the job. \n[59]Then he should make it his business to change that. \n[60]Son. About Rasputin -- \n[61]Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before. \n[62]I worry about you. \n[63]Well, I won't be around forever, you know? \n[64]Don't look! Turn around. \n[65]We can't risk it: You'll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents, search the area, top to bottom. \n[66]You're doing fine. \n[67]I'm dying Agent Myers. \n[68]And as a father, I worry about him. In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart... \n[69]What I ask from you is -- Have the courage to stand by his side after I'm gone. Help him find himself. Who he must be. He was born a Demon... You will help him become a man. \n[70]That's not how she feels. She may never feel it. \n[71]It's her choice -- She's human -- \n[72]Welcome back. \n[73]Come and go as you please. Find your way back.

The blood in his veins dried up decades ago. Only dust remains. Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel rod inserted into his pelvis held him up. What horrible will power could keep a thing like this alive? \n[77]No. Enough. He will never change -- always a child. Always. \n[78]SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16...

You will never understand the power inside you. \n[36]Child... \n[37]Look what you've done -- \n[38]You've killed me -- an insignificant man... but you have brought forth a God. \n[39]Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.

C'mon!! God knows, people manage to get good pictures at a wedding!! \n[3]That's the alleged best man -- ? \n[4]Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor. \n[5]I do. How many escapes?  This year alone: five! \n[6]Your \"guest\" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded. \n[7]A \"phase\"? What do you think this is, \"The Brady Bunch?\" These... freaks -- \n[8]These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo. \n[9]Hey, fishstick -- don't touch anything -- \n[10]See what?? \n[11]Is he serious?? \n[12]Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights? \n[13]But not everyone was so lucky. Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless. \n[14]Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then. \n[15]That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight. You know monsters. \n[16]In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you. \n[17]I want that thing locked up, starting now -- Now!!! You hear me??!! \n[18]We've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs. No trace of this \"Sammael\" or this \"Rasputin\" character. But we have this address -- \n[19]Sebastian Plackba #16. Volokolamsk fields, fifty miles from Moscow. We leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment -- \n[20]Hellboy's coming -- But I'll be in charge this time. Either we wrap this up or I'm closing this freak show for good. \n[21]When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades. \n[22]We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use... \n[23]Each of us gets a belt. \n[24]Forget it. This is practically a city. And it stinks, and it's muddy. We'll go back, check into a hotel, regroup after breakfast. We'll have to make a grid, go by quadrants. Maybe satellite photography. \n[25]What's that -- \n[26]We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart -- \n[27]-- should go back. Now! \n[28]I'm in charge. We go back! \n[29]Ouch!! \n[30]Well, it's not that big a fall... \n[31]You call that thing a cigar?? \n[32]You never, ever light a cigar that way. \n[33]Use a wooden match.
