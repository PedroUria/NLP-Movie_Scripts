Sni-- \n[8]\n[9]Me too. \n[10]This is it. \n[11]Sure. \n[12]There's nothing to talk about. \n[13]I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story. \n[14]You don't understand... \n[15]It was different this time. \n[16]I talked to Reynolds. He thinks I could still get the job at the San Diego station. \n[17]Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be? \n[18]Who's running? It's good money, full benefits. I'm tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank. \n[19]Throw what away? Don't you get it? I don't do anything. I sit, I watch, I film -- I let it happen. \n[20]No, Amy.   It's my excuse. \n[21]That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed. \n[22]Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say? \n[23]Sorry.     I took my eyes off the road. \n[24]I'll pull over next chance we get. Sorry... \n[25]Thanks. \n[26]I guess. \n[27]Is that right? \n[28]Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me. \n[29]How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble. \n[30]Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him. \n[31]C'mon, let's go. \n[32]Later.   Just get in. \n[33]No, let's just go. \n[34]I told you. Nothing. The guy was an asshole. \n[35]What'd you get? \n[36]You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here. \n[37]I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car. \n[38]I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not -- \n[39]Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera! \n[40]The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon. Goddammit. \n[41]What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard. \n[42]What the hell? \n[43]Nothing.   I -- \n[44]Hang on -- I can't steer! \n[45]Ow! \n[46]I'm fine. \n[47]I said I'm fine, okay? \n[48]What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car. \n[49]What? \n[50]Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the -- \n[51]Christ, not these guys... \n[52]Asshole... \n[53]What the hell? \n[54]I don't know. \n[55]Yeah.   Our car broke down. \n[56]Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer? \n[57]Think you could radio a tow truck for us? \n[58]How far is that? \n[59]Oh. \n[60]It's a new car. \n[61]Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along. \n[62]We don't know this guy. \n[63]Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here? Jesus... don't be stupid... \n[64]What do you think you're doing? \n[65]You're not riding with that guy. End of story. \n[66]Oh for Christ's sake... \n[67]Excuse me. \n[68]I was supposed to meet my wife here. \n[69]Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt. \n[70]Benetton shirt. \n[71]It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker? \n[72]Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler. \n[73]You sure? \n[74]Could she have left a message with another one of your employees? \n[75]I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner? \n[76]Shit. \n[77]Excuse me, how far is the next town? \n[78]Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please? \n[79]C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over. \n[80]Pull over!    Pull over! \n[81]I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me? \n[82]Where's my wife? \n[83]My wife.     Where is she? \n[84]I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there. \n[85]You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner. \n[86]How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes! \n[87]Your radio works -- What the hell are you doing -- ? \n[88]Amy?    Amy?!   You in there? \n[89]I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?! \n[90]Officer, I need your help! \n[91]I don't know, this guy has my wife! \n[92]I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her! \n[93]Don't lie, you son of a bitch! \n[94]Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up. \n[95]He's lying! \n[96]Are we gonna keep looking or what? \n[97]Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore? \n[98]Go to hell, you sonofabitch -- \n[99]It was him.    It was this truck. \n[100]No. \n[101]I wasn't paying attention. \n[102]What does that have to do with anything? \n[103]I don't believe this... \n[104]My wife did not leave me. \n[105]This is insane. You're just going to let him go? \n[106]I want your name and badge number. \n[107]Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 \n[108]Two months old. \n[109]Yes. \n[110]Did she come in? \n[111]You didn't see her, or she didn't come in? \n[112]Amy? \n[113]I want to see your order slips. \n[114]You write down the names.   I want to see them. \n[115]If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile. \n[116]Let me see the fucking slips. \n[117]Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police! \n[118]How'd you know? Did you see her? \n[119]Please, if you know something, anything, tell me. \n[120]What?    When? \n[121]No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw. \n[122]Yes... \n[123]Another truck? With who? \n[124]Do you know where they went? \n[125]Where by the river? \n[126]Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck? \n[127]Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me. \n[128]C'mon... work, goddammit... \n[129]Fuck. \n[130]Yes. \n[131]Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor... Listen, I -- don't put me on hold! I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing -- \n[132]I said Amy's been -- \n[133]Fuck! \n[134]Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't call back -- Steve?!       Steve?! \n[135]Goddammit! \n[136]Shit! \n[137]\n[138]\n[139]\n[140]\n[141]\n[142]\n[143]\n[144]\n[145]Where is she? \n[146]There's some... yeah... \n[147]I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates... \n[148]Ninety thousand. \n[149]Ninety thousand dollars. \n[150]What do you want? \n[151]You sonofabitch -- \n[152]How do I know she's still alive? \n[153]\n[154]I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston. \n[155]What? \n[156]Right. \n[157]Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take? \n[158]Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card? \n[159]My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000? \n[160]Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay? \n[161]Look, I'm going to tell you something. Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay? \n[162]There are people watching -- \n[163]Just... transfer the money. \n[164]Would you tell the manager I want the money in these denominations? \n[165]I'm here. \n[166]The whole thing. Ninety thousand. \n[167]When do I see my wife? \n[168]No.   First you tell me where she is. \n[169]I gave you the money.     Now let her go. \n[170]What the hell -- \n[171]Where is she, goddammit?   What'd you do with her? \n[172]Where is she?! \n[173]You like that?     How about this? \n[174]Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch! You want to try 'em again? \n[175]How about an emergency stop? You want to try that, Earl? Where is she? \n[176]Fuck you, you don't! \n[177]Is that what you want? You really want me to stop? 'Cause I bet this baby stops on a dime! \n[178]End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me? \n[179]Yeah?     Where's that? \n[180]Where were you taking the money? \n[181]Where? \n[182]I know where she is!   My wife! \n[183]You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped! \n[184]Officer, please. You gotta listen to me -- \n[185]\n[186]Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to the deputy. \n[187]The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit! \n[188]Hello? \n[189]Amy?   Amy, can you hear me? \n[190]Amy? \n[191]Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out. \n[192]Fuck! \n[193]It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear. \n[194]I'm going to get you out of there, Amy. \n[195]I love you. Please, God, let her still be alive. \n[196]Fuck you, asshole. \n[197]Give me the key. \n[198]Give me the fucking key! \n[199]Don't mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don't give me the key, I'll blow your fucking head off! \n[200]Your husband's a kidnapper and a murderer is what's going on! Did you know that about him? Huh? Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from? \n[201]You don't want to do that, kid. Just put the gun down. \n[202]Put the gun down. \n[203]I understand that, Deke. I'm not gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance I'll still kill your father. \n[204]No, Deke, don't listen to him. He's wrong. \n[205]Deke, no -- ! \n[206]Don't fucking move! \n[207]Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet! \n[208]It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up. \n[209]Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody! \n[210]Let's go.      Out. \n[211]Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife. \n[212]Do it. \n[213]Okay, now unlock it. \n[214]Good.  Now give me the keys. Deke, push the door open. Quickly. \n[215]That's enough, Deke. Let's go. Move it. \n[216]Deke, I need you to open this. \n[217]It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out. \n[218]Deke!    You at the freezer? \n[219]Okay. You're almost done. Just open it up, let the woman out. \n[220]You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you? \n[221]Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her. \n[222]You better pray she's all right. \n[223]Amy!!! \n[224]Amy, come up here! \n[225]I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now. \n[226]Okay.    Everybody in the cellar. \n[227]Do it! \n[228]Go to hell. \n[229]Let's get out of here. \n[230]Amy, no!    It's not safe -- \n[231]One of them's still loose.      C'mon -- this way! \n[232]Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home? \n[233]Hello? Anyone home? \n[234]C'mon, c'mon... \n[235]Take it. We may need to get out of here -- Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name! \n[236]No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in -- \n[237]Amy?! \n[238]C'mon! \n[239]What the fuck?! \n[240]\n[241]Get down! \n[242]\n[243]\n[244]It's glass!   Use the rifle! \n[245]Hang on! \n[246]\n[247]\n[248]You all right? \n[249]Yeah? \n[250]What is it? \n[251]What do you mean? \n[252]C'mon, Amy, push! \n[253]Push, goddammit! \n[254]\n[255]\n[256]C'mon, Amy, it's all you now... you can do it... \n[257]I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go... \n[258]How's the sheriff? \n[259]What about the leader? \n[260]Name it. ", "RED": "\n[1]You folks all right? \n[2]I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it off the road? \n[3]I sure would if I could, mister, but my C.B. blew a fuse this morning. I'm waiting till I hit the truck stop on I-40 to get it fixed. \n[4]About 60 miles. \n[5]I'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines. Used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up. Now it's all computers and chips. \n[6]That could be the problem. You been running it pretty fast? \n[7]Tell you what. If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. Belle's. They got a pay phone. You could call a tow truck from there. \n[8]Suit    yourself. Not many cops on this    road, that's why the truckers use    it. Maybe you'll get lucky. Good    luck. \n[9]Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take you both just as easy. \n[10]Watch your step, ma'am. \n[11]Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing? \n[12]No. \n[13]Huh? \n[14]How should I know where your wife is? \n[15]Mister, I don't know what you're talking about. \n[16]Nope.   Sorry. \n[17]Mister, I never seen you before in my life. \n[18]Look, mister, I don't know what you want, but -- \n[19]Officer, he's crazy -- I don't know what he's talking about. \n[20]I don't know, officer. I'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife. I swear, I never seen the guy before. \n[21]No, sir. \n[22]Hell yes, officer. Go right ahead. Name's Red, by the way. Red Barr. My permits are all current. You can check 'em out. \n[23]Nothing, empty load. I'm heading to Fresno for a pick up -- ball bearings or something. \n[24]Tell me about it. Too much competition nowadays. One horse guys like me gotta drive halfway 'cross the country just to get a payin' job. \n[25]No problem.   I understand. \n[26]Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes and whatnot. You want to take a look? \n[27]Look, I don't mean to butt in, but maybe you got my truck confused with someone else's. \n[28]Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay and help, but I really got to make it to Fresno... \n[29]Much obliged. Good luck findin' your wife, mister. No hard feelings. \n[30]You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey. \n[31]It's not me we're talking about. Question is what you want. \n[32]See, I've got something you might want to buy. Can't show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you. About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested? \n[33]Bring him up here. \n[34]Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall. See that building? \n[35]That's the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You with me? \n[36]Then here's the drill. You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet? \n[37]You ask for the money in cash. Small bills. \n[38]Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. It's your wife who's counting on you. \n[39]She's tucked away someplace safe. You get her back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that. \n[40]Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right? \n[41]Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate. \n[42]Like I said, Jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing I can do. Hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, I figure you're fixing on calling the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the 82nd Airborne. \n[43]Problem is, you can see this town for miles around. So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here? They gonna fly in? Drive in? Either way, we'll see 'em. So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead. \n[44]Now take a look at the building with the flagpole. \n[45]There's exactly two cops in this town. One of them's inside pulling ass duty; the other's on patrol in the foothills. Now a minute ago one of my men called in a non-injury accident on the I-40 connector. \n[46]It'll take that good ol' boy 20 minutes to get to the connector, another 10 to see there's no accident, and another 20 or so to tool his way back. 50 minutes all in. \n[47]That's your deadline. If for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before I'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good. \n[48]See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we don't like something, we split. Period. Helluva lot safer than sticking up 7-11s, wouldn't you say? \n[49]Put this on. You can't go into the bank like that. \n[50]How about it, Jeff? Time to get the show on the road? \n[51]No shit. I can SEE that.   How much you got? \n[52]Good. Turn left and start walking toward the main road. Get in the first car that stops. \n[53]When I say so. Now walk. \n[54]I don't know, dammit, he was supposed to be here a half hour ago. There's reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms... \n[55]Look, I'm getting out of here. Stay off the airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn... You got that? \n[56]Hey, Deke, you miss me? \n[57]I told you, we've got some stuff to take care of. Won't be more than a couple of hours -- I promise. \n[58]Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy? \n[59]Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you. \n[60]Guess which hand. \n[61]Nope.    Try again. \n[62]Nope. \n[63]Okay, okay, I'll give it to you. \n[64]Deke?   Deke, you back there? \n[65]Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl? \n[66]So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off. \n[67]Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing? \n[68]Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us with the girl. \n[69]Must've died from the exhaust. \n[70]I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out. \n[71]Shit, it's my wife. Help me get her in the freezer. Just a second, Arleen. \n[72]\n[73]Don't   worry, honey. It's not as bad as   it sounds. It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out.    Probably won't even feel it. \n[74]C'mon, let's go. \n[75]Sure thing, honey. \n[76]... So there I am, it's a howling snow storm, I've got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in Denver days ago, and this cop is busting my balls because I haven't got chains... \n[77]So what happens but   this big old rooster, damn thing   must've weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out toward that highway   patrolman... \n[78]... just reaches out with his beak, see, and... \n[79]Now hold on, mister. I don't know who you are or what you want -- \n[80]Mister -- \n[81]I don't know, honey.        Just stay calm -- \n[82]Don't listen to him, Deke.        Keep the gun on him. \n[83]He's lying, Deke. He can't get me. Just pull the trigger. \n[84]Plug him, boy!     Do what I tell you! \n[85]That's right, boy.       Do it.   Don't worry about me. \n[86]Do like he says, Arleen.      He's crazy. \n[87]This ain't gonna work, boy. \n[88]It's okay, Arleen.      Take it. \n[89]The switch is on the right. \n[90]It's all right, son.     Just ignore that stuff. \n[91]Remember this moment, pretty boy. 'Cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run, I will hunt you down and kill you like a dog. \n[92]Sonofabitch -- \n[93]You think you can come into my life and fuck with me? Nobody fucks with me! \n[94]You think you can fuck with me?! \n[95]", "AMY": "\n[1]God, I missed you. \n[2]Let's get out of here. Where's your equipment? Don't tell me you checked it? \n[3]No camera? \n[4]No nothing? \n[5]Ah ha. \n[6]Jeff? \n[7]Can I come in? \n[8]Couldn't sleep? \n[9]I remember when you took that. We had fun on that trip, didn't we? \n[10]You want to talk about it? \n[11]C'mon, Jeff. \n[12]That's   it? \n[13]Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility. You can't keep beating yourself up over it. \n[14]What do you think? You could have stopped that girl from getting killed? \n[15]Oh, Jeff, you didn't... \n[16]Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away? \n[17]You know I'll never stand in your way. But you've worked so hard. Are you sure you want to throw it away? \n[18]You're supposed to let it happen. It's your job. \n[19]Jesus, Jeff... \n[20]Maybe it's time we took a break, you know? \n[21]Sort of.    We're moving, actually. \n[22]California. We thought we'd take the scenic route. \n[23]Thanks. I'll mention it to my husband. \n[24]What was that about? \n[25]You want me to drive? \n[26]Is something wrong? \n[27]This isn't the Grand Prix, you know. \n[28]What's bothering you? \n[29]Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff? \n[30]This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts. \n[31]What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts? \n[32]Very funny. Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that? \n[33]Who? \n[34]Should we go back? \n[35]Look, maybe if we call the cops -- \n[36]What'd you do? \n[37]Found your camera. \n[38]Are you okay? \n[39]Out of range? \n[40]What's going on, Jeff? \n[41]Not the car. \n[42]What's going on with you? \n[43]It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this. \n[44]Jeff, I'm talking to you. \n[45]Jeff -- \n[46]What's he doing? \n[47]\n[48]Are you nuts? \n[49]He's offering to help. It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along. It's 100 degrees.        You really want to be stuck out      here? \n[50]Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride. \n[51]Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston. \n[52]Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner? \n[53]That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse. \n[54]I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff. \n[55]You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together? \n[56]\n[57]Jeff!!?? \n[58]I'm almost free!!! \n[59]They were going to kill me. \n[60]But there's a phone inside.

How could they treat it like a... business? \n[78]Promise me one thing... \n[79]Next time... we fly. ", "EARL": "\n[1]Nice car. \n[2]Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards. \n[3]Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio. \n[4]'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle. \n[5]How about Shit-for-Brains? You damn near killed us back there, boy. \n[6]The hell I did. I saw what happened. \n[7]Yeah.     I bet you don't. \n[8]Howdy, ma'am.

Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive. \n[21]Get out.   Don't try anything stupid. \n[22]Toss the envelope on the seat. \n[23]Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money, then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway. \n[24]Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around. \n[25]Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck. \n[26]Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. Do it now! \n[27]'Let her go.'    Do I look like I have her? \n[28]It's done. I'm heading in. Gotcha. \n[29]You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble!' \n[30]I'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up. Help, help, I ain't got no power! \n[31]You know what I'm gonna do first with your money, boy? Well, do you? \n[32]I'll give you a hint. Only one thing smells better than money. You wanta guess what? \n[33]What the hell? \n[34]These are... it's nothing but singles...

Tell me what's going on. \n[3]All right -- everybody just calm down. Sir, you want to tell me what happened? \n[4]Sir? \n[5]And you didn't give his wife a ride? \n[6]Sir, all right with you if I search your truck? \n[7]That won't be necessary yet. Just stand back behind the line. Both of you. \n[8]All right, let's see your license and registration. \n[9]What are you hauling today, Mr. Barr? \n[10]Long way to go empty. \n[11]Yes, we are. Sir, I'm gonna have to see everything. \n[12]Those yours? \n[13]No. I think we're pretty much done here. You're free to go. \n[14]Sir, I searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle. \n[15]Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested? Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe you did get them mixed up. \n[16]Hey! \n[17]Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you. \n[18]Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate? \n[19]What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that? \n[20]Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today? \n[21]Well, for starters, maybe she left you. \n[22]I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa. \n[23]I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I appreciate your cooperation. \n[24]I've got his information. If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look. \n[25]Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help. \n[26]The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing. \n[27]If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up. \n[28]10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way. \n[29]Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary -- \n[30]Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor. \n[31]What the hell? \n[32]Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up! \n[33]Jesus Christ -- Dispatch! Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor! \n[34]Drop the gun! \n[35]I understand plenty. Now get down on the ground or I'll shoot! \n[36]You there -- in the pickup! You all right? Can you get out? \n[37]Well, get out dammit! \n[38]Shut up. C'mon out, sir.

I see things. \n[6]Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the river. \n[7]Dunno.

According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. Is that true? \n[15]Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. Your wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you. \n[16]Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history. What do you think, Earl? \n[17]Yeah, I suppose. Too bad. Guess you're not the donut magnate after all. Waste of time. Plug him. \n[18]Say again. \n[19]Shut up. \n[20]There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it. \n[21]I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah.
