{"dialogues": {"WALLACE": "\n[1]Go home. Some of us are in this, I can't help that now. But you can help yourselves. Go home. \n[2]On your way somewhere, M'lord? \n[3]My name is William Wallace. I am no bandit who hides his face... Find this man a horse. \n[4]Give him a horse. \n[5]Not this horse. That one. \n[6]Today we will spare you, and every man who has yielded. Go back to England. Tell them Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. Tell them Scotland is free. \n[7]Hamish, I... thank... \n[8]Thinking. \n[9]What do we do when Longshanks sends his whole northern army against us? They have heavy cavalry. Armored horses, that shake the very ground. They'll ride right over us. \n[10]We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long. \n[11]Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope. \n[12]Thank her for me. \n[13]That's my friend, Irishman. And the answer's yes. You fight for me, you kill the English. \n[14]Stop here and rest. \n[15]Marion! Is... is it you? \n[16]I'm dreaming. \n[17]I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you. \n[18]I need you so much! I love you! \n[19]He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide them and run! \n[20]Split again! \n[21]No matter how we go, they follow. They have our scent. My scent. \n[22]They've tricked us. \n[23]The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them. \n[24]Exactly. \n[25]No English lord would trust an Irishman! \n[26]Do the nobles rally? \n[27]For presenting yourselves on this battlefield, I give you thanks. \n[28]I give homage to Scotland. And if this is your army, why does it go? \n[29]Sons of Scotland!... I am William Wallace! \n[30]Yes, I have heard! He kills men by the hundreds! And if he were here, he would consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his ass! \n[31]I am William Wallace. And my enemies do not go away. I saw our good nobles hanged. My wife... I am William Wallace. And I see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. You have come to fight as free men. And free men you are! What will you do with freedom? Will you fight? \n[32]Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and you will live, at least awhile. And dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom? \n[33]No! They will not! \n[34]And I will. \n[35]Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field. \n[36]I have an offer for you. \n[37]From his king? Absolutely. Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags and march straight to England, stopping at every Scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. Do that, and your men shall live. Do it not, and every one of you will die today. \n[38]I'm not finished. Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that bridge, stand before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass. \n[39]Be ready, and do exactly as I say. \n[40]Steady! Hold... hold... NOW! \n[41]\n[42]Here I am, English coward! Come get me!! \n[43]Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be sure the English see him ride away! \n[44]lifts his sword. \n[45]For Scotland! \n[46]You are Robert the Bruce. \n[47]My father fought in support of yours. \n[48]I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground. \n[49]LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands this! This! \n[50]There is a difference between us. You think the people of this country exist to provide you with position. I think your position exists to provide the people with freedom. And I go to make sure they have it. \n[51]And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less? \n[52]We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why. \n[53]Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would \n[54]Back! Wait for it to burn! \n[55]\n[56]Behold the enemy we fight! We will be more merciful than they have been. We will spare women, children, and priests. For all else, no mercy. \n[57]Longshanks! I have come. \n[58]Wife of Edward, the king's son? \n[59]It's battle I want, not talk. \n[60]I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are. \n[61]York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls. \n[62]Longshanks did far worse, the last time he took a Scottish city. \n[63]I am no bandit. And I do not lie. \n[64]Or in French if you prefer that: Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to his face, and see if his eyes can convince you of the truth. \n[65]A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas. \n[66]\n[67]She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant. \n[68]I've never told anyone. I don't know why I tell you -- except because you look... much like her. And someday you will be a queen, and you must open your eyes! Tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, while I live. \n[69]A thousand. You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face. \n[70]Peace?! \n[71]With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen! \n[72]We won at Stirling and still you quibbled! We won at York and you would not support us! Then I said nothing! Now I say you are cowards! \n[73]War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you. \n[74]Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it. \n[75]And I will consult with mine. \n[76]Remember when the English turned their hounds on us? Maybe we should introduce them to our dogs. \n[77]Mornay has come. So will the Bruce. \n[78]Stephen ready? \n[79]Irish troops! \n[80]It's only a faint to shield the crossbows! \n[81]Now! Give 'em the dogs! \n[82]Now! Charge! Charge them! \n[83]Hamish! Ham -- \n[84]Get him away! \n[85]A charge! Form up! Form up! \n[86]You... were like my father... \n[87]Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves. \n[88]A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it. \n[89]Why did you? \n[90]You have... you have a husband. \n[91]I cannot love you for the sake of revenge. \n[92]I rest. \n[93]Aye. But it won't let me dream. \n[94]You've all sworn to Longshanks. \n[95]So let the council swear publicly. \n[96]I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland. \n[97]Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way. \n[98]Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too. \n[99]We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom! \n[100]My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it. \n[101]No. One of us is enough. \n[102]Treason. Against whom? \n[103]Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king -- \n[104]-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject! \n[105]I do not confess. \n[106]I am so afraid... Give me strength. \n[107]M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger. \n[108]Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves? \n[109]If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already. \n[110]Your people are lucky to have a princess so kind that she can grieve at the death of a stranger. \n[111]Every man dies. Not every man really lives. \n[112]It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me. \n[113]That... will... clear your sinuses. \n[114]", "PRINCESS": "\n[1]Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead. \n[2]Shall I leave, M'lord? \n[3]You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended. \n[4]Scotland. He intends -- \n[5]He intends to grant -- \n[6]...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand -- \n[7]No, M'lord. \n[8]Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord. \n[9]How do you know this? \n[10]He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed. \n[11]This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman? \n[12]...I wouldn't know. \n[13]I am the Princess of Wales. \n[14]I come as the king's servant, and with his authority. \n[15]But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman? \n[16]I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight. \n[17]Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin? \n[18]That is not possible. \n[19]Hamilton, leave us. \n[20]Leave us now. \n[21]Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally. \n[22]Peace is made is such ways. \n[23]I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman. \n[24]Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. Not from the king, but from myself. And not to you, but to the orphans of your country. \n[25]No. He did not. \n[26]He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him. \n[27]...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord. \n[28]Humbly, M'lord. \n[29]No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war. \n[30]Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule. \n[31]Good day to you, M'Lords. \n[32]I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion. \n[33]Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way. \n[34]I have faced him. Have you? \n[35]He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them. \n[36]Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush. \n[37]And you have reached Wallace's men? \n[38]It does me good to see you. \n[39]There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month. Food and weapons. They will trav -- \n[40]Then why did you come? \n[41]Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met. \n[42]I know. You looked at me... and saw her. \n[43]You must forgive me what I feel. No man has ever looked at me as you did. \n[44]I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises. \n[45]You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king? \n[46]No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you? \n[47]No one! Hurry! \n[48]When we... did you think of her? \n[49]Is it true? Wallace is captured? \n[50]When will his trial be? \n[51]I will see the prisoner. \n[52]The king will be dead in a month! And his son is a weakling! Who do you think will rule this kingdom? Now OPEN THIS DOOR! \n[53]Stop! Leave me! There is no way out of this hell! Leave me with him! \n[54]Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy. \n[55]Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live. \n[56]You will die! It will be awful! \n[57]Drink this! It will dull your pain. \n[58]I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it! \n[59]I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace. \n[60]I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people. \n[61]Even now, you are incapable of mercy? \n[62]Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love. \n[63]You see? Death comes to us all. And it comes to William Wallace. But before death comes to you, know this: your blood dies with you. A child who is not of your line grows in my belly. Your son will not sit long on the throne. I swear it. ", "WILLIAM": "\n[1]I finished my chores. Where we goin'? \n[2]Why would MacAndrews make so many scarecrows? \n[3]R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!... \n[4]I can fight. \n[5]They're coming! \n[6]Three, maybe more! \n[7]They're English soldiers, ain't they? \n[8]It's up to us, Hamish! \n[9]Not yet! Here he comes, be ready! \n[10]I wanna have supper waitin'. \n[11]Aye, we'll get 'em. \n[12]I don't want to leave. \n[13]It was in Latin, sir. \n[14]Good night, Uncle. \n[15]What are they doing? \n[16]I hit it in the head. With a rock. \n[17]Miz MacDougal. You look well. \n[18]Hamish? \n[19]You win. \n[20]The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here. \n[21]A contest, then. \n[22]I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can. \n[23]Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw? \n[24]Then do it. Come, do it. \n[25]I will not. \n[26]That's not the point. \n[27]That is. \n[28]Good to see you again. \n[29]Would you honor me with a dance? \n[30]He died in an accident, with my brother. Their cart turned over. \n[31]Good evening, sir. May I speak with your daughter? \n[32]Marion... Would you like to go for a ride on this fine evening? \n[33]It's good Scottish weather, Madam, the rain is fallin' straight down. \n[34]Your father doesn't like me, does he? \n[35]Thank you for accepting. \n[36]I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy. \n[37]Sir, I know it was strange of me to invite Marion to ride last night. I assure you, I -- \n[38]What kind of meeting? \n[39]I know who my father was. I came back home to raise crops. And, God willing, a family. If I can live in peace, I will. \n[40]Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure. \n[41]No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you. \n[42]I want... to marry you! \n[43]I'm not just saying it! \n[44]But I won't give you up to any nobleman. \n[45]I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one. \n[46]I will be with you, like this. Forever. \n[47]I will love you my whole life. You and no other. \n[48]I've missed you. \n[49]Tonight then. \n[50]Then when? \n[51]reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper into the trees. \n[52]Marion! \n[53]We have beaten the English! But they'll come back, because you won't stand together. There is one clan in this country -- Scotsmen. One class -- free. One price -- courage. \n[54]Their families are starving, they'll feed them however they can. If you don't want to fight them -- \n[55]I am much diminished since we met. \n[56]No. Stop. I didn't come here for that. ", "HAMISH": "\n[1]How many? \n[2]Armed? \n[3]With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm! \n[4]Wanna stay with me tonight? \n[5]We'll get those English pigs tomorrow. \n[6]Test of manhood. \n[7]Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones. \n[8]No. It's here. \n[9]That depends on the man. \n[10]I could crush you like a roach. \n[11]You'll move \n[12]I threw longer than last time! \n[13]An ox is stupid enough to just stand in one place. \n[14]I should'a remembered the eggs. \n[15]Ah, William... I am so sorry. \n[16]I'll wait... back there. \n[17]Fourteen? -- \n[18]Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty? \n[19]A common thief. \n[20]William! Hounds! \n[21]We don't split up! \n[22]Let's kill him anyway. \n[23]Wish I could see the noble lord's face when he tells him. \n[24]Ride around and ford behind them! \n[25]Wallace says do it! And he says for you to let the English see you! \n[26]William -- French guards? \n[27]The Bruce is not coming, William. \n[28]Aye. \n[29]No. You're going to live. \n[30]We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya. \n[31]There is... one thing, William. Longshanks is offering a truce. He has dispatched his daughter-in-law as his emissary, and she has sent word that she wishes to meet you -- in a barn. \n[32]Rest, William. \n[33]Your rest is making me exhausted. \n[34]You know it's a trap. \n[35]I don't want to be a martyr. \n[36]That's just a dream, William! \n[37]Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it? \n[38]Keep these. We're going too. ", "ROBERT": "\n[1]My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes. \n[2]It is too soon to step out alone. My father believes we must lull Longshanks into confidence, by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it. \n[3]He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland. \n[4]You did. \n[5]In Lanark village, the king's soldiers killed a girl. Her lover fought his way through the soldiers and killed the magistrate. \n[6]He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted. He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love? Whatever it was, he has more of it than I. \n[7]I'm too arrogant to lie. \n[8]A commoner named William Wallace. \n[9]This Wallace. He doesn't even have a knighthood. But he fights with passion, and he is clever. He inspires men. \n[10]Does anyone know his politics? \n[11]Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk. \n[12]No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead. \n[13]I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles. \n[14]Sir William -- \n[15]Please, Sir William! Speak with me alone! I beg you! \n[16]You have achieved more than anyone dreamed. But fighting these odds looks like rage, not courage. Peace offers its rewards! Has war become a habit you cannot break? \n[17]I am trying. \n[18]I must... consult with my father. \n[19]This... cannot be the way. \n[20]Fight me! Fight me! \n[21]\n[22]He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won. \n[23]He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight. \n[24]In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break. \n[25]Is it true about Mornay? \n[26]And he rode through the window? My God. \n[27]He was a modest man. \n[28]If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king? \n[29]The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace. \n[30]He will. I know he will. \n[31]Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a brave heart. \n[32]He is not to be harmed. I have your king's absolute promise that he will be imprisoned only! \n[33]Longshanks promised! \n[34]After the beheading, William Wallace's body was torn to pieces. His head was set on London bridge, where passerby were invited to jeer at the man who had caused so much fear in England. His arms and legs were sent to the four corners of Britain as warning. \n[35]It did not have the effect that Longshanks planned. \n[36]And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a body of Scottish veterans, rode out to pay homage to the armies of the English king, and accept his endorsement of my crown. \n[37]Stop.

I will deal with him. \n[6]Nobles are the key to the Scottish door. Grant their nobles land here in England. Give our own nobles estates in the north. Make them too greedy to oppose us. \n[7]Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an old custom. Grant them prima noctes, \"First night.\" When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our lords shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.

How dare you bring a panicky lie. \n[15]If he can sack York, he can invade lower England. \n[16]Edward, who is this shitpoker who speaks to me as if I needed his advice? \n[17]You fight back at last! \n[18]We must sue for a truce, and buy him off. But who will go to him? Not I. If I came under the sword of this murderer, I would end up like my nephew.

So he accepted our bribe. \n[20]Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced. \n[21]You spoke with this Wallace in private.

You may return to your embroidery. \n[23]This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool. \n[24]My greatness is better demonstrated with this. \n[25]So the Scots will have none of them, will they?

We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France. \n[30]What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve. \n[31]He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower? \n[32]His legend grows!

You cannot blame me for this. \n[24]You mock us with a smile? \n[25]Wallace's followers. \n[26]The little cow is insane -- \n[27]Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation. \n[28]Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed. \n[29]You fancy him. \n[30]Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead. ", "CRAIG": "\n[1]Young Robert, we are honored -- \n[2]Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here. \n[3]A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council. \n[4]No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must. \n[5]Sir William. In the name of God, we declare and appoint thee High Protector of Scotland! And thy captains as aides decamp! \n[6]Sir William! Where are you going? \n[7]But... what will you do? \n[8]Invade?! That's impossible, it -- \n[9]That is why the Pope outlawed the weapon! It makes war too terrible. \n[10]We must sue for peace. \n[11]We cannot defeat this -- \n[12]It is suicide. \n[13]May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin? \n[14]It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear. \n[15]Our nobles are frightened and confused... Wallace has the commoners stirred up again, from the Highland clans to the lowland villages. In another six months Christ and the Apostles could not govern this country. \n[16]Longshanks knows his son will scarcely be able to rule England, much less half of France. He needs Scotland settled, and he trusts you, after Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he will recognize you as king of Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to this as well. \n[17]Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters! \n[18]That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace. \n[19]Sir William. We come to seek a meeting. \n[20]An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you. \n[21]We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one. \n[22]He has already agreed to come. \n[23]He won't come. \n[24]Now we will have peace. \n[25]You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday.

Come down here, lad. \n[3]He's tired, he should get a longer run. \n[4]Brave show! \n[5]An ox is strong, but not clever. \n[6]A fine display, young Wallace! \n[7]MacClannough's daughter is another matter. We come to fetch you to a meeting. \n[8]The secret kind. \n[9]Your father was a fighter. And a patriot. \n[10]Say Grace to God, lads. We've just seen the coming of the Messiah. \n[11]Pour it straight into the wound. I know it seems a waste of good whiskey, but indulge me. \n[12]Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, lads. \n[13]Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now it's nothing but a fly swatter. \n[14]MacGregor -- from the next valley! \n[15]What're ya doin'? \n[16]Does it hurt? \n[17]Insane Irish -- \n[18]A royal entourage comes, flying banners of truce, and the standards of Longshanks himself! \n[19]Son... I want to die on the ground. \n[20]Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. Goodbye, boys. \n[21]I don't think I can do without one of those... whatever it is... \n[22]...And glad to die, like him...

You never catch 'em in the Highlands. \n[7]So why is this strip concealed? He fought for you, eh? \n[8]An assault on the king's soldiers is the same as assaulting the king! \n[9]Now. Let this scrapper come to me. \n[10]Don't look surprised! We knew he'd bring friends! \n[11]No! I beg you... mercy! \n[12]Please. Mercy! \n[13]Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say? \n[14]It matters not, he is thy king! \n[15]Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU \n[16]Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe. \n[17]We will use it all before this is over.

Rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more. \n[19]Very well then. Rack him. \n[20]Wonderful, isn't it, that a man remains conscious through such pain.

I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity. \n[5]A patriot! \n[6]We must run in different directions! \n[7]They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way! \n[8]We can't stop! \n[9]What's the crazy man saying, Lord? \n[10]Who would do such a thing? \n[11]I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger! \n[12]The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight, it's drawn the finest people. \n[13]Fine speech. Now what do we do? \n[14]The Lord tell me He can get me out of this mess. But He's pretty sure you're fooked. \n[15]Her husband's more of a queen than she is. Did you know that? \n[16]So that's where Longshanks got his soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill Scottish cousins for the English. \n[17]No. I'll stand with you. \n[18]They can't be that stupid to attack the schiltrons again. \n[19]Betrayed! \n[20]Come, it'll help you sleep.

Scotland\u0092s nobles fought him, and fought each other, over the crown. So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce. No weapons, one page only. \n[4]Among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with his own lands and two sons: John... \n[5]...and William. \n[6]Twelve years later, Longshanks supervised the wedding of his eldest son, also named Edward, who would succeed him to the throne. \n[7]As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival, the king of France. \n[8]It was widely whispered that for the Princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That may have been what he had in mind all along. \n[9]Having seen to his obligations to provide for a successor, Longshanks set about his fondest business -- to crush Scotland, and turn his power against France... \n[10]Now in Edinburgh were gathered the council of Scottish nobles... \n[11]Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce, a leading contender for the crown of Scotland.

The English can't get across! He's evened the odds at one stroke! \n[9]Then you are prepared to recognize our legitimate succession! \n[10]Those were lies when they were written!
