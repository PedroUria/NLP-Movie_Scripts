{"dialogues": {"CECIL": "\n[1]\n[2]I fuckin' hate car chase scenes! \n[3]\"Smokey and The Bandit\" ruined my childhood! CECIL fires his gun in the nick of time and shatters approaching cop car's windshield. PETIE makes a hard right and zooms up church driveway as two cop cars collide behind him. FIDGET cheers like a kid and starts absentmindedly playing pocket pool. \n[4]Hi, Mrs. Waltrup. \n[5]No, ma'am, we were at a movie premiere. \n[6]Not me, I like the big screen. \n[7]I sure will. SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off. \n[8]Casting has been completed! PETIE peels out in other direction. 53. Cut to EXTERIOR \"SPROCKET HOUSE,\" a run-down, 53. seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is interrupted by faint sirens in the distance. Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. \"dressing room\"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his fingers. HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film crane. \"Otto Preminger\" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep. \n[9].Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented and I'm your new director... HONEY stares in confused horror. \n[10]I'd like you to meet your co-stars ...I call them the \"Sprocket Holes.\" HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now changed from their theater uniforms into their own scary \"terrorist chic\" fashions, gather around CECIL in a \"crew-shot from hell\" pose. \n[11]This is Cherish... CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed \"riot-girl\" style, in a \"SINEMA\" T-shirt, steps forward. We see \"Andy Warhol\" tattooed on her thigh. \n[12]Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a \"Herschell Gordon Lewis\" tattoo across his skinny chest. \n[13]Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily. \n[14].but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration. \n[15].And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we see her \"Sam Peckinpah\" tattoo on her arm. \n[16]Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm. \n[17].but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of terror. \n[18].\"Little\"? \n[19]Good morning, Miss Whitlock. Know your lines? \n[20]DeMenTED! \n[21]Nonsense, Miss Whitlock... I wrote the part just for you... (Hearing helicopter noise outside, and smiling .and the whole world is watching... \n[22]Ah Fidget. Fidget, my little genius, :Fidget! \n[23]Miss Whitlock, we're an a schedule... \n[24]\n[25]This is Sprocket House, Miss Whitlock, think of it as your studio. They arrive at the amazingly inventive exterior set of \"RITZ CINEMA,\" a tiny guilded movie palace gone to seed. Marquee reads: PASOLINI FESTIVAL. HONEY stares dumbfounded. \n[26]Can't you say good morning to Lewis? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero. \n[27]Our picture is called \"Raving Beauty.\" You play the insane owner of a failed art theater who along with her film fanatic boyfriend Lyle. . .Lyle come on over... LYLE enters dressed in hepcat 70's junkie splendor wear. \n[28].and her violence prone daughter, Cherish... CHERISH enters in eye-popping \"super model goes bad\" look as HONEY's eyes light up in horror. \n[29].Together, the three of you vow to start a revolution to destroy mainstream cinema... \n[30]You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse! \n[31]I know how cid you are... \n[32]\n[33]There are no creative differences on a Cecil B. DeMented set, Miss Whitlock. Got that? One day you'll thank me for saving you from your bad career.  \n[34].and ACTION! CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse camera and sound moves behind him. All the camera equipment has \"UNIV OF MD\" stenciled on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly. \n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]CUT and PRINT! CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES burst into applause. \n[39]That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look. \n[40]Let's move on! \n[41]The first take is the only real truth... \n[42]There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges. We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style. You see, I've had a vision... All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to \n[43].and that vision is called \"ultimate reality.\" The rest of our film is shot in real life, with real people ... . and yes, with real terror. 63. Flip wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Industrial 63. doors swing open and freshly painted phony FEDEX truck comes speeding out. \n[44]That's not what TIME Magazine has to say. \"Miss Whitlock seems a little ill at ease and past her prime to carry a picture by herself, especially one as sappy and overproduced as \"Some Kind Of Happiness.\" \n[45].and remember there are no bad takes in a Cecil B. DeMented picture - just keep the scene going \n[46]Your Hollywood system stole our sex and co-opted our violence so there's nothing left for our kind of movies... except this! \n[47]\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]I am Cecil B. DeMented and you're in my movie! Look in the camera and ruin a take and you're both dead! CANDY COUNTER GIRLS get nervy, eager to be in any movie. \n[51]\n[52]Say the lines! \n[53]\n[54]I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage. RAVEN does a \"devil dance\" with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head. \n[55]I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but you know I can't... \n[56]I'm not \"all your directors,\" Cherish. \n[57]SOLDIERS OF CINEMA, save your sexual energy for the silver screen... SPROCKET HOLES break apart and look up to CECIL. \n[58]Our footage is stronger than Otto Preminger's... CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo. \n[59].creepier and darker than David Lynch's... LEWIS scratches a sexual note in the music as he lusts towards CHARDONNAY who sings out a torrid moan. \n[60].more exploitative than Herschel Gordon Lewis. LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind. \n[61].and more violent than Sam Fuller..- DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires at \"The Films of David Lean\" coffee table book she uses as a target. \n[62]We will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest! Cut to FIDGET sneakily dialing parents on phone as HONEY nods her support. \n[63]. Do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release! Get as drunk as Sam Peckinpah... PAM guzzles whisky. \n[64]As high as Rainer Werner Fassbinder!... LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint. \n[65]But stay celibate for celluloid! Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban MOM answer on split screen. \n[66].Feel the black humor of Almodovar... RODNEY dances a wild S&amp;M step and tries to look PETIE in the eyes. \n[67].the satanic fury of Kenneth Anger! RAVEN, possessed by the devil, rolls her eyes back in devil horniness. \n[68].the racial tension of Spike Lee... CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon. \n[69]phone and giving him the \n[70]\n[71]Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... \n[72].help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film! \n[73]\n[74]\n[75]all the SPROCKET HOLES \n[76]Good morning, Miss Whitlock. \n[77]Whatever for? Your old career is over. . .but your comeback has just begun... CECIL nods to DINAH to start tape and we see a TEENAGE BOY on news in front of vandalized Timonium theater. \n[78]There are still some people who don't understand our work... DINAH zaps on TV and we see MIDDLE-AGED MAN in suit behind podium at press conference. Subtitle identifies him as \"MARYLAND FILM COMMISSIONER.\" \n[79]\n[80].And this time somebody might have to die! 79. Wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 79. Doors swing open and CECIL's speeding van, driven by PETIE and now hurriedly painted over to resemble UTZ Potato Chips delivery vehicle, flies out and careens around the corner. \n[81]of script, to HONEY, LYLE \n[82]Not anymore they don't! \n[83]Cherish has recovered memory. \n[84]It's all behind you now, Cherish.  We're here... .and we're makin' movies! \n[85]It's ok, Cherish. This way.. \n[86]Shut up, Cherish. I've told you. \n[87]Now Honey...I want you to do a little stunt for this scene... \n[88]A simple little stunt. \n[89]See Pam? HONEY looks down to PAM, and sees PAM putting gaffer's tape mark on deck of ship. \n[90]That's your mark. When you hear \"Action,\" jump through the window, and land facing Pam's camera. \n[91]Prove yourself, Honey. HONEY spots a marine police boat quickly darting behind \"Pride of Baltimore,\" filled with MARINE \n[92]CHERISH and LYLE, and handing \n[93]Don't worry, they're just props. After your first line, throw the grenade at the Film Commission. Nobody will get hurt. \n[94]Blanks ...trust me Honey. HONEY gulps. \n[95]Lock it up! \n[96]I kidnapped the right star, didn't I? HONEY smiles weakly. \n[97]\n[98]ALL EXTRAS - keep eating the oysters or you will be shot and killed! \n[99]Do it. MARINE POLICE suddenly open fire on SPROCKET HOLES. RODNEY is instantly killed as he mixes HONEY'S hair dye. PETIE's face turns to stone at seeing his dead \"boyfriend.\" HONEY screams, thinking she is being rescued as RAVEN bravely tries to touch up her makeup. \n[100]\n[101]\n[102]\n[103]\n[104]It's your closeup, HONEY! \n[105]\n[106]\n[107]Film these fuckers, Pam. \n[108]\n[109]\n[110]You're one of us now, you know what to say! \n[111]\n[112]\n[113].The slash and burn of the white hot metal will brand you forever with the logo of Cecil B. DeMented... Wear the privileged scar of cinema sainthood with pride and horniness... LYLE projects the dailies of the day on wall as he pops Percodans. HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time, watches her \"stunt\" footage with pride as she gets the vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes about the ritual of making the perfect martini. LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL. CHARDONNAY painfully caresses her fresh brand and wails out the chorus of \"DeMented Forever.\" HONEY empties ice tray into martini shaker. \n[114].There is no such thing as family. We are the orphans of cinema and without our movie, we do not exist!... PETIE approaches CHERISH with the red hot brand and she eagerly sticks out her. arm. \n[115].Rodney died for the roots of cinematic rebellion... HONEY stops making martini and quickly checks her hair to see if any dark roots are showing and smiles at \n[116].and he's now in cinema hell where one day we'll all be reunited. RODNEY brands RAVEN. \n[117]I knew you were the weak one, Fidget. (Eyes widening in hypnotic \n[118]And to top it off...they talk out loud in the theater once the feature has begun! SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror. Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours martini into glass. \n[119]And you...Honey? \n[120]You ain't seen nothing yet! Tape cuts to FILM COMMISSIONER, bandaged but defiant. \n[121]Say it... HONEY downs martini and, trembling in anger, puts out her arm for the brand. \n[122]\n[123]\n[124]I I am Cecil B. DeMented and this picture is TERMINATED. PAM shoves Panavision camera off crane and it just E misses DIRECTOR as it smashes to floor. \n[125]\n[126]It's OK! We got it on film! Keep going! \n[127]\n[128]\n[129]\n[130]This is it - our final location. \n[131]Nobody leaves this drive-in alive until we finish our film. \n[132]Cecil B. DeMented. \n[133]Hello, this is Cecil B. DeMented speaking to you directly from this theater... CECIL FANS A, B &amp; C jump out of their cars happily along with other supporters. REDNECK FAMILY guiltily starts up engine of car, hoping to escape along with other terrified FAMILIES. JOCKS A, B &amp; C leap from car, ready for a fight as do other gung-ho CECIL ENEMIES. \n[134]\n[135]Pay no attention to the studio executives in the helicopter above...I HAVE FINAL CUT!... CECIL FANS A, B, C and other FANS rip off speakers from poles and throw them at JOCKS and other CECIL ENEMIES. \n[136].Fans of outlaw cinema - they're here to use you for market testing! CECIL FANS let out a war-cry of defiance as they fight ENEMIES with fists, bottles, anything they can grab as FAMILIES scream in terror, trapped. \n[137]They want to detain some of you and put you in focus groups! \n[138]But I won't let them!... \n[139]\n[140]\n[141]\n[142]Honey Whitlock is here with us tonight... CECIL FANS yell their approval. \n[143].Live and in person! And she's dying to meet you! GROUPIE proudly shines the headlights of his car towards the roof of the concession stand as other CECIL FANS follow suit. 162. EXTERIOR ROOF OF CONCESSION STAND. Lit like a sound 162. stage from car headlights. LEWIS backs out on roof pulling PAM with camera in MANAGER's wheelchair that she is using as a dolly. CHARDONNAY follows with boom pole to record th' sound. PETIE and FIDGET struggle to carry CECIL on \"set\" in a makeshift stretcher as RAVEN applies makeup to his wounds. CHERISH is at his side, caressing him lovingly. \n[144]Honey, I've had a final vision. Would you set your hair on fire for our movie...? \n[145]Prove yourself one more time... for your cast... HONEY looks into CHERISH's brainwashed face as her eyes roll back in her head, flash cut with \"Directed by Andy Warhol\" credit. \n[146]Your crew... SPROCKET HOLES stare back at HONEY in a fast montage of their insane faces hallucinating credits of their favorite directors: William Castle, Kenneth Anger, Sam Peckinpah, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fassbinder. FIDGET holds a pitiful fire extinguisher. \n[147]Your fans... HONEY looks to GROUPIE in a sea of cheering FANS. He is finishing up carving HONEY's initials \"H.W.\" in his forehead with a pop-top beer can tab. \n[148].and for me, Cecil B. DeMented! \n[149]SWAT TEAMS and COPS as they advance toward him and then to HONEY You will be the eternal flame of cinema insanity. HONEY's eyes glaze over in cult madness. \n[150]\n[151]The Martini shot... HONEY smiles nostalgically at the mention of her favorite drink. \n[152]\n[153]\n[154]That, fellow Sprocket Holes, is a wrap! HONEY, charred and still sizzling, smiles weakly and feels her almost bald head. SWAT TEAM CAPTAIN takes aim with rest of SHARPSHOOTERS. Instantly PAM is shot dead by SWAT TEAM SHARPSHOOTER and her camera falls to ground. \n[155]throw tear gas at warring mob \n[156]\n[157]roof in wheelchair, towards SWAT TEAM below ", "HONEY": "\n[1]Ah, what a town! HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise Brooks style that has become her signature. She continues her press conference under the watchful eyes of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere. ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve. \n[2]I tell everybody in Hollywood, when you shoot on location in Baltimore, you don't need to bring all the crew from Los Angeles. Baltimore really ia the best!... 5. Cut back to INTERIOR LOBBY OF SENATOR THEATER. 5. MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH. \n[3]Look at this dump of a town! HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY. The press is gone and they are alone. \n[4]Get me the fuck back to L.A. If one more asshole mentions a crab cake to me, I think I'll puke. \n[5]No I didn't! I'm not interested in any kind of meal you have to beat with a mallet... A knock is heard at hotel door. \n[6]Just a minute... (Muttering to herself as LIBBY goes to answer door .wearing some stupid kind of bib while families of mutants gawk in my face ...No thank you! CHARLES, the press agent enters. \n[7]Thank you Charles, darling. We'll be right with you. I'm excited. CHARLES exits. \n[8]Do you think Pat Nixon got fucked in this hotel room? \n[9]It's called the \"Presidential Suite\" isn't it? \n[10]I BET SHE DID!

I want to know! \n[12]You didn't actually ask him? \n[13]You asked the hotel manager if Pat Nixon had sex in my room? \n[14]I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely star-struck. \n[15]Did you hear what that little bitch said to me? \n[16]In show business we say \"break a leg.\" NEVER fucking \"Good Luck\"! HOTEL GUESTS frown in disappointment at HONEY's language. \n[17]That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language. \n[18]Mayor Fenwick!

Thank you very much! You're so kind! MRS. MALLORY sneakily disconnects a tube to LITTLE WILLIAM who starts gasping for air. \n[26]\n[27]\n[28]Owwww! Please!

DINAH leans over set wall from above and watches with open lesbian lust. \n[36]The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie. \n[37]Oh, God, I look terrible!  CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly. \n[38]Good... morning. \n[39]\"Daughter\"?! \n[40]I cannot make this movie!

I'm just not motivated... \n[43]It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it?

CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY. \n[51]From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen! The SPROCKET HOLES watch in awe. \n[52]Death to those who support mainstream cinema! \n[53]To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system. \n[54]What? No coverage? \n[55]But you can't cut the film with only a master! \n[56]Please, no! Let's go back! I hate location work! 64.

Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight? \n[68]Don't you think you ought to call them...? \n[69]You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high. \n[70]I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro. \n[71]Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony. \n[72]OWWWW!! Please... please...  Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness... \n[73]Well ...I'm sorry to hear that... \n[74]Don't say that, Raven! Tell her, Rodney - no movie is worth dying for! RODNEY blasts HONEY's hair with his fiery malfunctioning drier as she cries out in pain. \n[75]OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle... \n[76]\n[77]Oh God, stop... \n[78]\n[79]Cecil, I want to go back to Hollywood! \n[80]Cherish, this is America.

Are you sure this stuff really happened? \n[88]I. .I believe you. \n[89]A what? \n[90]It doesn't say anything about a stunt in your rewrite. \n[91]But Cecil, surely you realize I could be injured... \n[92]Maybe with an air bag or some kind of safety precaution... \n[93]Alright, Cecil. I'm a professional... Roll the camera. \n[94]But there are bullets in this gun... \n[95]of terrified producers headed by Film Commissioner Which one of you assholes insulted our movie?!  \n[96]\n[97]\n[98]DON'T SHOOT!

DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a human shield as she fires away, hitting several cops. \n[99]\n[100]\n[101]\n[102]\n[103]But Cecil...you didn't write me any dialogue... \n[104]\n[105]That really is unforgivable, Fidget! FIDGET looks around at the brainwashed faces of his disgusted, judgmental cult and crumbles. HONEY greedily gulps down her martini. \n[106]No, Cecil... CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape. HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on screen with JAY LENO on \"The Tonight Show.\" \n[107]\n[108]This time, .1 have a fucking vision! CECIL's eyes light up in madman glee. 105.

TEAMSTERS oversee crew trucks, honey wagons and the star trailers, all the while guarding the set from any outside trouble. In the foreground, the Hiway Film Delivery Truck pulls up, hastily painted over to read \"Rhebs Chocolates.\" We see PETIE behind the wheel, disguised in delivery uniform.
