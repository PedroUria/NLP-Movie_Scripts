{"dialogues": {"WALTER": "\n[1]Is that like a must? Can't I just say like \"I'm employed\" or something? \n[2]My work's not really that interesting. To women. Um. Or men. \n[3]I'm a Practical Asset Manager. For a corporation. \n[4]Mostly I guess I commute to work? It's like an hour and-- \n[5]It is, Todd. Yeah. Hey, when can I leave a \"wink\" for someone? To see if they \"wink\" back, or..? \n[6]Cool. \n[7]I forgot what I put there? \n[8]Oh, okay. \n[9]I sure will. \n[10]...Me? \n[11]Yeah. Why? \n[12]taking a personal \n[13]personal interest is a \n[14]...okay thanks for asking, I guess, um, Todd was your name? \n[15]Okay. Cool. \n[16]Sounds good, Todd. \n[17]Later... Todd. \n[18]What's up, Roy? \n[19]Our whole company did? \n[20]Gary? You're Vice President of Acquisitions. Right? \n[21]... we just got acquired. Did you know that? Roy said. \n[22]Yeah, Roy said. \n[23]Yeah, they probably have their own acquiring guy. \n[24]I'm a Practical Asset Manager. \n[25]I do. Yeah. Totally. I work in a one-on-one basis (on a one-on-one basis I mean) with all our photographers. \n[26]I was just saying I manage our film negatives from the moment they arri- \n[27]What time is that? \n[28]Okay. \n[29]Okay. Thank you. I mean \"not thank you.\" I mean like \"looking forward to it\" I should have said. \n[30]\n[31]Awesome. \n[32]Hey, Hernando- \n[33]This 12th neg? From this last Life roll? \n[34]It's not here. \n[35]It's of something that's the Absolute Quintessence of Life. Or something. \n[36]It means like the best ever. \n[37]Um no. \n[38]Tim, did you find out anything about Negative Box 2-6? Where it was sent from? \n[39]Yeah, the guy who took this-- \n[40]...I'm getting nervous with these new guys around. Lost negative. But I'm not going to freak out. I think my work here the last nine years speaks for itself. I've made my mark. \n[41]What is this? \n[42]What is this? \n[43]I think it's either a man with one sideburn. Or a candelabra. Or a Happy Days lunch box. \n[44]It's the Quintessence of Life. So I don't think it's two badminton racquets. Sean O'Connell took this just before he took another one we lost. \n[45]\n[46]The negative? Yeah, I tried to reach him. He's always in Bahrain. Or a shanty town or somewhere - I got one email off. \n[47]No cell phone. He's out on a freelance. I'd really like to find him. \n[48]These are pictures from the last roll he sent in. I'm trying to draw a bead on his location by analyzing these. \n[49]Not yet. Because my trail is... water. \n[50]A Starbucks, which I don't know which one. And a man  thumb. \n[51]I've been trying to figure out the gender , as I sat here. How many people in the world? \n[52]Everyone's got two, too. \n[53]Thumbs. \n[54]Look what Sean gave me. \n[55]Because we covered, you know, so many hotspots together the last 9 years... ...boldly \n[56]You guys covered the hotspots together boldly? \n[57]As a team. Yeah. By Sean actually going to the hotspots, and by me staying here waiting for the pictures of hotspots to come back so I can boldly transfer them to magazine format. \n[58]We're moving my mom here. I went and packed her house up. What about you? \n[59]It's a sign of disdain here. \n[60]They've been targeting western journalists all summer. It's been a real hot August. \n[61]Let's just get this camera bag out of here. We can shoot the shit later, O'Connell. Over whiskeys. \n[62]I tried to leave a \"wink.\" For someone. But it didn't work. \n[63]No, it says \"unable to perform request,\" Todd. So I don't think my wink really went through. Do I have like a broken page or something? \n[64]Well, okay, something's not working. On my page. \n[65]Any what? \n[66]...I don't have any dimensions? \n[67]I don't want to be one now. I just am one. \n[68]It's an occupation. When I became an adult I thought that would be possibly a good thing to have. Because I keep getting bills from places. \n[69]...I studied music. \n[70]April. \n[71]Yeah. But I was working at Orange Julius to save money for college. That April. And my hands were always sore from working the Frother. \n[72]Sure. \n[73]A piece of Cheers. The first piece. Part. \n[74]Hey, Todd. I have to go. I have a piano situation I have to take care of. \n[75]Um hey, can I have my four hundred dollars back? \n[76]Rich, are you ready to push a piano down a street and get honked at by everybody in New York? \n[77]Her dad bought it for her when she was six. It's seventy-years-old. \n[78]My sister's not the responsible one in the family. \n[79]She told them no steps. I paid them for a first floor move. But she screwed up and got my mom a apartment on the 15th floor. The movers weren't equipped to get it up there. She didn't have the money for them to take it back. She had to get her braces adjusted, so she just took off. \n[80]36. \n[81]Yeah. Hey, Rich. You're pretty good on that. \n[82]I used to skateboard a little. \n[83]Maine. When I was a kid. Hey. I'll bring it in tomorrow. I don't want you to have to carry it all the way home. I got it. \n[84]You helped me move a piano. I can carry this. See you Rich. Thanks for putting your back into it. \n[85]Just, you know... helping out, man. \n[86]Yeah. \n[87]Are you sure I can't walk you home? \n[88]Is this the Arctic Ocean..? A glass of Sprite. \n[89]Hey were you able to use the Circulation computer to find that ship? That boat? \n[90]Nuuk? \n[91]....Greenland. \n[92]Tim, what would you say is a good accomplishment of yours, like something that you'd put on an online dating page? \n[93]Seriously? \n[94]Wow... \n[95]Yeah. How did you know you can do that? \n[96]I was thinking about putting that I've never really been late coming back from lunch. \n[97]...Yeah \n[98]Hey, Mom. \n[99]Sure, \n[100]Hey, your new place is almost ready. We just had a little hiccup due to Odessa just not getting the right one. \n[101]Why did she get the cool name? She got to turn out cool. \n[102]Why did you name me Walter? \n[103]Okay. This is starting I think. We should probably just stop here to-- \n[104]little rattled about the quintessence cover news \n[105]Mom, come on. It's nothing. \n[106]You know, the thing about Greenland... it's really not that far, man. \n[107]Greenland. \n[108]It's a country/island. Sean might be there. It's not as close as Canada but it's really not as far as it sounds. When you hear it. Look. \n[109]This looks like a chair. Here. \n[110]Have you seen this chair? \n[111]I think it's a chair. Or a pipe. A man's pipe. \n[112]Have you seen this pipe? \n[113]\n[114]thumb? \n[115]...You're the Queen of Greenland? \n[116]That's cool... your Majesty. \n[117]Should I call you that? \n[118]Is there anything around here that a renowned photographer might be photographing? \n[119]Are you sure? \n[120]I think he was here. \n[121]Can we see that? \n[122]So are you Queen for life? \n[123]That's a good gig. They're making some changes at work. My work. They're letting most of the divisions go. \n[124]Nine years. \n[125]How'd you get to be Queen? \n[126]...My dad sold ice cream. \n[127]That's the Musk Ox migration? \n[128]There's just three of them. \n[129]Where are they migrating? \n[130]\n[131]You're the captain of the Erkigsnek? I don't know how to pronounce that. \n[132]You're boat was photographed. In the past four days. Do you know where? \n[133]Can you guess from where? \n[134]Yeah. \n[135]Yep. \n[136]Did I just say \"yep?\" I'm sorry. I meant \"nope.\" I'm an office worker. We're trying to secure a photograph he might have, that's valuable to my company. \n[137]So he just went by us? \n[138]So there's no one here who might have had contact with him, who might know where he's going. \n[139]No, I don't have any... mailing needs. \n[140]Can I ask you a question? \n[141]Where was your thumb like four days ago? \n[142]I can't believe I found one thumb. \n[143]Sean? \n[144]Yeah, why? \n[145]Man, I really need to contact him. We're in a transition period and-- \n[146]...Can't we just call them? I could ask him on like the boat phone. \n[147]Can I just ask him on the \"ship to shore?\" Instead of going on that old-looking helicopter? \n[148]You're leaving now? \n[149]The weather doesn't seem great. Feels like there a storm \"moving in.\" \"Brewing.\" \n[150]But you're just going to finish \n[151]Okay. I'm not going to go with you. \n[152]Is that a fjord? \n[153]I've seen pictures of fjords. But I've never actually seen a fjord. I don't think I've ever even said the word fjord out loud-- \n[154]Okay. \n[155]I'd really like to get my hands on this property. They're making some changes at the office. It's going to reflect poorly on my work. I might get let go. And I have a mounting piano situation that's-- Whoa... \n[156]\n[157]How do you-- I just see a fin. Can you get a bead on some more information? \n[158]From your ship? \n[159]Took him where? \n[160]Can we radio them? There's something I need to discuss with-- \n[161]Sean slept here? \n[162]In this Subaru Outback? \n[163]He was photographing Chilean Stevedores? \n[164]This was his room/car? \n[165]Hey. Walter. \n[166]Did you guys, were you living in this car back seat when Sean O'Connell lived in the front seat? \n[167]Sean? \n[168]Is that-- Are you saying quin-- \n[169]Are you saying Quintessence? In the Spanish form? Yeah. Sean says that. \n[170]Is that Clementine cake? My mom makes-- I didn't know anyone else made that. \n[171]Clementine cake. Wow. \n[172]This is Sean's. \n[173]...this is an itinerary. \n[174]That's where Sean is. Tomorrow. This gibberish. I have to crack it. \n[175]I have to crack the gibberish. \n[176]...Sean's in Iceland. We're going past there, right? Can we land there? \n[177]Can you get me there tomorrow? \n[178]Would you like some Clementine cake? \n[179]It's very good. It tastes, man, exactly like my mom's. I didn't know Chilean mom's made this. Small world. \n[180]Oh. Sorry. \n[181]Okay, I'm going to go, take my cake and..... \n[182]...Hello? \n[183]Yeah. \n[184]...Oh. Hey. Um, do I owe you guys money? Because your supervisor was clear I can't get my 400 dollars back. But I don't think I'm going to renew- \n[185]The last time we talked? The time you told me I have no personality? \n[186]Well, I take my work seriously. Also keeping a tidy apartment. I help my sister out paying her bills now and then. But can we not list that? None of that stuff really seems like an accomplishment. \n[187]Braces. \n[188]She hasn't asked me for rent money. For like a year. But I did pay for her braces. She's 36. \n[189]I fought a dolphin. \n[190]Yeah. \n[191]They are. I think they're probably the best mammal. \n[192]This mammal tried to protect me. And most of the other mammals I know, like the mammals at the office, they're dicks. \n[193]I'm on a ship. \n[194]Near Greenland. I tracked a thumb here. To Nuuk, Greenland. I located the thumb. Now I'm fortunately going to Iceland to correct an oversight. \n[195]It was just one. \n[196]Okay, Todd. \n[197]Do I? Because I think I'm a little worse. \n[198]So. Okay. I'm supposed to kayak in? \n[199]....shit. \n[200]Fuck. Sorry. \n[201]Hey, Mom. \n[202]What's up? \n[203]Okay. Cool. \n[204]That's awesome. \n[205]...Your piano got towed? \n[206]I lent her money for that space. \n[207]In Iceland. \n[208]My mom's piano. \n[209]the question in regard to \n[210]It's a piano. \n[211]It's right out there. I just walked by it. Do you have more than one piano? \n[212]It's a piano. \n[213]It's not a car. Its a musical instrument. I should have had my musical instrument inspected? By a government. \n[214]We can't move into my mom's until tomorrow. \n[215]Man.... You know what? Don't worry about it. \n[216]Don't worry about it. \n[217]Yes. \n[218]No. \n[219]I tried to join, but-- I don't really even want to be on it. I'm just trying to do this thing with someone at work. \n[220]I'm trying to do that Pi\u00f1a Colada thing? \"If you like Pi\u00f1a Coladas, and getting caught in the rain while wearing a cape--\" \n[221]Well, the guy answers a personal ad and finds out it's his wife. They have a good laugh, then they make love on the cape while drinking Pi\u00f1a Coladas or something, and wearing capes, I think. Anyway. I'm hoping she'll click my profile and not realize that she works in my office area. Then we can realize it and have a good laugh. Then-- \n[222]No, then we can know that we picked each other out, you know, from the whole planet. Not just the cafeteria. \n[223]... We're friends. I'd like there to be more. \n[224]I was hoping this web site (that they won't let me be on) would show her more. \n[225]I don't know. What do you think it is? \n[226]We better tell them they need to shift that over to outside the big room. \n[227]The big room where the big piano is going to go. \n[228]Hey, Odessa? \n[229]You know when I asked you to pick the apartment out for Mom, you understood that she was taking her piano along. \n[230]Oh, I thought I made that clear when I said the English sentence to you Mom's bringing her piano with her. A month ago. \n[231]Did you enjoy that juice drink? That you were making (for some reason) simultaneous to me talking to you about important matters? So, okay, right now the piano is hanging in the air, above a city, we can't fit it in here, and I'm not sure I can afford to move it anywhere else. So I hope you enjoyed that juice drink. \n[232]We can't. It's the only thing she really wanted to take along. I think it's really best for her. She can still play. Reading's not that easy for her now. She doesn't really have any friends in New York. \n[233]What's that move-in like. In terms of deposits and-- for Villa living? In a Villa situation? \n[234]How much should I make this deposit for today? To reserve it. \n[235]Where's that frigging Clementine cake wrapper thing... \n[236]Warlock... \n[237]I almost found someone I was looking for. For work. In Iceland. This is where he's going next. I just don't know where it is. Warlock. Little weird deer. Like kind of a fez-style hat. \n[238]That's what these things are. Klipspringer. Koofiyad. I just don't know what they add up to. I put them all in Google nothing comes up. \n[239]Yeah. Don't worry. \n[240]Yeah, I do.... Thanks. \n[241]Oh. Hey. \n[242]You know we haven't really had a chance to talk yet. I know you're deciding who's vital to the transition. And I wanted to let you know what I do-- \n[243]I am. Totally. \n[244]...It's my birthday. \n[245]No... Um, my sister gave me these. \n[246]My... \n[247]His arms and legs stretch outward. Um. But that's not-- I wanted, before we have the chance to talk, I need to discuss an asset situation with you. \n[248]I've processed the digitization of every single photograph in Life's library. Two million and eleven. But we haven't been able to locate this last negative. \n[249]I'm confident we'll find it. \n[250]Yes. \n[251]I've been here nine years-- \n[252]Helmut Newton didn't-- \n[253]I didn't Helmut Newton you. \n[254]I didn't Helmut Newton anyone. I was saying I haven't misplaced a negative in nine years. I've handled every negative in our library and prepared them for our archive. I've overseen their digitization, catalogued each photographer's period-specific film and photo equipment. And I've managed the preservation of the original vision of each photograph. I've never mishandled a single nega- \n[255]I know where he is. Sean. \n[256]Somewhere-- I haven't pieced it together, somewhere were there are little deers and Warlocks. \n[257]Yes. \n[258]\n[259]Did you call me Cubicle? \n[260]Well, yeah, but I'm not named after one. \n[261]Mom, why are you-- did you need something? \n[262]Yeah. \n[263]...thanks, Mom. \n[264]Warlord? \n[265]words from the clementine \n[266]Why did you just say that word? \n[267]...koofiyads. \n[268]...Warlord. \n[269]I need to buy a ticket, I think to Dubai. Because I'm going, actually, to Mogadishu  which I think, I'm not allowed to do from here, because it's illegally dangerous. \n[270]Here you go. Whoa, what do you have in there? \n[271]I like your trucks. I used to skateboard. Where are you guys headed? \n[272]Hey, do you guys know anyplace to stay, that's not like an arm and a leg. \n[273]Business center. \n[274]Do you know-- are there American journalists working here? What would someone want to photograph here? \n[275]Who's evacuating? \n[276]The peacekeepers? \n[277]Like right now? \n[278]...Sean? \n[279]Sean? \n[280]Sean O'Connell? \n[281]Hey. Walter Mitty. From the office. \n[282]...Yeah. Hey. Man, I've really been trying to reach you. Hey. It's good to finally meet you. Thanks for the wallet, man, by the way. Sean, do you happen to know where that negative 12 is. 2-6? On the roll three? \n[283]You know what, we don't. I've looked in every neg box and even every camera bag and we have in the warehouse. I even double-checked the Teaneck warehouse. \n[284]I really don't. \n[285]Loan you... what? \n[286]Fuck... \n[287]Do you have any sense how I could get back to America if I can't afford a plane ticket right now? Totally? \n[288]I give your brother two dollars and then he'll tell me how to get back to America? \n[289]...I can go to America for two dollars? \n[290]Hey, Todd. It's Walter. Mitty. \n[291]Hey I wanted to add a couple items? \n[292]To my Been There, Done Thats. If that's cool. \n[293]Okay. Mogadishu? \n[294]Been there. \n[295]Cheryl Mellhoff. \n[296]Walter Mitty. \n[297]Thanks. \n[298]Hey. \n[299]Almost... \n[300]...I'm okay. \n[301]I got the board in Dubai. Hey, Rich. Here watch. The board's going to come up. You don't have to try to lift it. \n[302]You really just have to think about landing. Both feet. Same time. \n[303]No, I lost him. He said I had it though. Like he knew. He smiled. He said \"you have it.\" \"You.\" What's he talking about? \n[304]Excuse me. Can you pass key me in? I need to see Ted. My pass key isn't working. I need to let him know I verified that I have negative 12. I just didn't verify where I have it. \n[305]Yes. \n[306]Yes. \n[307]I need to speak to Ted. I found \n[308]Is there someone who took over Ted's responsibilities? On a \n[309]Yes. \n[310]I didn't lose it. I have it. The photographer told me. I just don't know where I have it. \n[311]Those are no grounds. You can't fire me for not having something that I have. \n[312]I have it. I always have had it. When you fired me, I had it. Why are you trying to hit me with Squash balls? \n[313]No one's informed me that I've been let go. \n[314]I should be sent my November check. \n[315]There's no cause to keep my salary. Ow. \n[316]I'd like to speak to your supervisor. \n[317]I demand to speak to your supervisor. \n[318]I'd like to demand to speak to your supervisor. \n[319]The Purpose of Life-- \n[320]Hey, fuck you, man. \n[321]What is this? \n[322]....Mom? \n[323]Hey, did-- did a guy take a picture of your piano? Like a week ago? \n[324]...yeah. \n[325]Where did you get Sean's camera? \n[326]Sean O'Connell? \n[327]Me? \n[328]Do you know where-- \n[329]Man, I've been desperately searching for him. For a long time. Thanks, mom. \n[330]I know. I don't want you to worry. It's not always cool and easy. ... why did you take a picture of your piano? \n[331]Mom. Hey. Come on. I like my job. I mean it's not my dream job. So what? I have a lot of company. \n[332]...I don't even remember. \n[333]I have to go somewhere, mom. Possibly I'll be reachable by phone. \n[334]What are you? \n[335]Cool. \n[336]Thanks, man. \n[337]Grammy. Best male R &amp; B vocal performance. \n[338]You, too. \n[339]That's okay. \n[340]None? \n[341]...Not one? \n[342]I'm trying to locate a photographer. \n[343]The information I have (from my mom) is that he's working with a guide named Stepit. Any idea... is that enough of a clue where they might be? I know they're photographing snow leopards, and this is the snow leopard region-- \n[344]I need to go there. \n[345]Didn't you just say that only that other guy can take you through there? Safely? \n[346]Yes. \n[347]This way? \n[348]Aren't you coming? \n[349]That's-- that's how you're guiding me? By pointing and saying go that way? \n[350]...Hello. \n[351]Hey, Todd. \n[352]Not much. \n[353]Okay. Cool. \n[354]Great, man. \n[355]It even sounds cold? \n[356]Nepal. \n[357]I don't really do a lot of, you know, swinging. \n[358]Yeah. \n[359]Oh. I don't mean that. \n[360]I meant like partying, I guess. I used to like to be at work at 8. And I have some family demands that keep me pretty busy. \n[361]Yeah. \n[362]\n[363]Well, I'm not going to move and let the people who lean on me fall, because the people who lean on me are my mom and my sister. \n[364]A little. \n[365]I don't get a lot. But I guess if I had to say - mostly I just consider thoughts... for my visions for ideas and scenarios about the world. \n[366]Yeah. \n[367]...Sean? \n[368]Hey, I got to go. \n[369]Cool. \n[370]Sean O'Connell? \n[371]Walter. Mitty. \n[372]I've been looking for you. \n[373]Yeah, warming up. \n[374]Hey, Sean. I really need that picture. I'm taking a lot of heat at work. Over that. \n[375]Yeah. \n[376]Why am I sitting on it? \n[377]I thought that meant inside the wrapping paper. I never opened it. Goddmanit. The wallet. I left the-- \n[378]Oh, yeah... Fuck. \n[379]I-- can you believe it - I just this morning I put it in a receptacle thing. \n[380]Well, I didn't know I was throwing that out, but... yeah. \n[381]I just didn't believe in Life's Purpose anymore. So I fucking (I cannot believe it) chucked it. \n[382]No... \n[383]No. \n[384]Oh. \n[385]...We may have to sell Mom's piano, in order to pay for the Villa. This week. \n[386]Yeah. \n[387]It's \"f\"d up. I know. But if I don't get my severance I'm going to have to forfeit that deposit, because I can't afford the room. And I won't have enough to get her another place. Another decent place. \n[388]Yeah. \n[389]Almost? \n[390]Nothing I just want everyone in the world to be Morgan Freeman. So it would just be me and Morgan Freemans, in the whole world. \n[391]You'd be you. But like a combo with him. Just a little calmer, more quiet.
