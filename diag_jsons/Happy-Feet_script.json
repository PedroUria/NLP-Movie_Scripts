Soon as the sun goes away, everyone gets religious \n[10]Caruso's the leader because he's so incredibly old. Some say more than 40, but you know how penguins exaggerate. \n[11]My dad was never that devout. Often his mind was on other stuff. \n[12]I guess he was wrong about a lot of things. \n[13]Ow!

How I...\" \n[40]Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult \n[41]I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going. \n[42]Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin? \n[43]And that's exactly what I found. \n[44]Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here. \n[45]Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing? \n[46]Lunch?...There's food? Here? \n[47]But ...but. I'm a penguin. \n[48]I don't have juicy bits! Look... all bone and feather! Feel for yourself. \n[49]Wait!

What's that on your leg? \n[52]How...? \n[53]Unbelievable. \n[54]You don't say \n[55]At least those aliens didn't eat you. \n[56]So - You think I could appeal to your better nature? \n[57]Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun \n[58]Most days I hid at the back, dreaming about the world beyond \n[59]Time passed. We all grew up \n[60]But right up to graduation I never did find my heartsong \n[61]Caruso. He couldn't help himself. \n[62]Dad, Ma, can I go with the others \n[63]Dad? I'll learn to sing later.

No I don't. \n[72]Yes I do. \n[73]The only bad thing about being with Ella. It was always so darned crowded. \n[74]\n[75]Ella?

That's terrible \n[97]So why aren't you guys collecting them \n[98]....you think I could get some of it? \n[99]You really think so? \n[100]So for a while I forgot about finding a song altogether. \n[101]...We were a team \n[102]...there was so much to do, so much to see \n[103]....stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining. \n[104]Oh! There you are \n[105]Guys!    I want to speak to you. \n[106]But its dead. It can't hurt you \n[107]But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish. \n[108]The who? \n[109]Why stones? Wait for me \n[110]I was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens? \n[111]...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs.... \n[112]... and he said he was abducted by Aliens. \n[113]Looks like they bestowed it very tight. \n[114]So these Mystic Beings, did you see them? \n[115]Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you? \n[116]But I haven't had any answers yet! \n[117]We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We sing \n[118]La la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa!! \n[119]See. That's how I ended up with you guys. And emperor who can't sing isn't an emperor at all. \n[120]You can?! \n[121]Tall and tanned and young and lovely The Girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes each guy she passes goes `Aaaah' \n[122]Oh, and I want her so badly How can I tell her I love her? Yes I would give my heart gladly \n[123]But each day when she walks to the sea, She looks straight ahead not at me....\" \n[124]Hi Ella, what do you think? \n[125]Ella. Wait! \n[126]I'm sorry. \n[127]Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you. \n[128]I can't sing. \n[129]But I'll show you something better \n[130]Sing something to this! \n[131]Just try it. This once. \n[132]Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going. \n[133]This is it Ella! This is the song inside me! \n[134]I'm just showing them Happy Feet \n[135]Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage. \n[136]My own opinion? I think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big, flabby...... \n[137]\n[138]This is craziness \n[139]You too pa?! \n[140]No. Dad. No. What have they done to you. You're talking like Caruso. \n[141]No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa here. \n[142]Its no use Ella. I can't live with that. \n[143]Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit \n[144]OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk an alien. I'm going to find what's causing the shortage \n[145]Its the only way. You're right. Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyone \n[146]Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried \n[147]Now go back. I love you. Go. \n[148]To find the mystic beings. \n[149]We'll ask Loveday. He's been there. \n[150]Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings? \n[151]No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight. \n[152]Stop. You're hurting him. \n[153]LOVEDAY, where did you get it? \n[154]They didn't bestow it on you? \n[155]If it wasn't bestowed, what happened? \n[156]And then....? \n[157]You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck? \n[158]Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really? \n[159]But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off. \n[160]So where do we Go, Loveday \n[161]The forbidden place is over the mountains... \n[162]...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!? \n[163]...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!? \n[164]So who's coming \n[165]Hear that?! \n[166]Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore. \n[167]We're looking for the Mystic Beings \n[168]Aliens, the ones who made this. \n[169]Could they be taking our fish? \n[170]But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce. \n[171]Come on Loveday, lets go \n[172]They don't know. They've never been there \n[173]So we walked ... and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard country \n[174]We need to huddle! \n[175]Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth! \n[176]I said a circle! \n[177]Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!! \n[178]You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore? \n[179]Hello?! Is there anyone out there? \n[180]Hello!! \n[181]What is it? \n[182]They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around. \n[183]A whale? \n[184]The ones with teeth!! \n[185]No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe \n[186]\n[187]Aliens?! \n[188]Stop! Please!.... \n[189]...It's very important! \n[190]\n[191]They've stopped! \n[192]Say Hi to Ella for me \n[193]Oh. One other thing. You guys \n[194]Excelsi yah!!! \n[195]\n[196]\n[197]Too loud. \n[198]Too loud! \n[199]The Convergence? \n[200]I'm trying to talk to the Aliens! \n[201]On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish! \n[202]They kill whales! That's impossible \n[203]So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go \n[204]Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there? \n[205]When I finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than I'd imagined \n[206]The - fish - are - ours. Understand? \n[207]We can't live without them! \n[208]Speak Adelie? Skua-talk? \n[209]Oh no! Not the pointy thing! \n[210]I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming from \n[211]Wow. They brought me home \n[212]Excuse me, where are we. \n[213]Oh. So we're dead. Right \n[214]Where? \n[215]Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon. \n[216]Fish on land and fish underwater. \n[217]Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it \n[218]Aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep \n[219]What have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here! \n[220]After a while, you learn to stop fighting it. Stop protesting, take the knocks. \n[221]...just take what comes and live inside your mind \n[222]Sometimes I thought about dad and mum. Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met along the way. But mostly I thought about Ella, wondering who she ended up with. Whether she had enough food to eat. whether she still remembered our song. \n[223]What? What did I do? \n[224]You like that? Well how about this. \n[225]Hi, where is everybody!? \n[226]I used to live here. When's the Great Gathering? \n[227]This is all that's left? \n[228]Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a bit. \n[229]Are these all yours? \n[230]So. You never.... \n[231]But that's fantastic. I've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone. I found out who's been causing the Scarcity! \n[232]I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me. Listen. \n[233]No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and.... \n[234]But its true!! \n[235]It's so they can find me. That's them now. Listen. \n[236]You said they didn't exist. \n[237]No. Do this. Do Happy feet. \n[238]Come on, everyone! Happy Feet! It's our only chance! \n[239]\n[240]\n[241]That's it! Excellent! \u00a1Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!! \n[242]From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more. \n[243]Ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick. We take turns looking after her and going to get the fish. \n[244]I worry about her, sure. Theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening. \n[245]But the way I see it.
