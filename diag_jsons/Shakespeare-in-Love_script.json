Richard Crookback? \n[7]Who wrote that? \n[8]Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona. \n[9]Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds? \n[10]Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over. \n[11]No, then. \n[12]To my weekly confession. \n[13]Words, words, words\u0085once, I had the gift\u0085I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones\u0085for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery\u0085but now \n[14]Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift. \n[15]I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. \n[16]Nothing comes. \n[17]It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. \n[18]A goodly length in times past, but lately \n[19]I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a woman, half as old again. \n[20]She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so \n[21]On my mother's side the Ardens \n[22]Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. \n[23]yet cannot love nor write it. \n[24]Will it restore my gift? \n[25]To the Palace at Whitehall. \n[26]Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You too, good Crab. \n[27]No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it. \n[28]I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. \n[29]When I have fifty pounds. \n[30]A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful. \n[31]Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover. \n[32]Romeo \n[33]It's for Henslowe. He paid me. \n[34]Ten pounds. \n[35]I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. \n[36]Done. \n[37]I have lost my gift. \n[38]Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? \n[39]You see? The consumptives plot against me. \"Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it.\" \n[40]I feel a scene coming on. \n[41]Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! \n[42]Richard! \n[43]Burbage? \n[44]Mr. Tilney \n[45]So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. \n[46]I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare. \n[47]You have opened the playhouses? \n[48]But the plague \n[49]Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part. \n[50]Give me to drink mandragora. \n[51]Kit \n[52]Wonderful, wonderful. \n[53]I have. And chinks to show for it. \n[54]I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business. \n[55]I hear you have a new play for the Curtain. \n[56]I love your early work. \"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\" \n[57]Good title. \n[58]Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know. \n[59]Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word. \n[60]Yes, that's good. Until he meets \n[61]Do you think? \n[62]The daughter of his enemy. \n[63]Mercutio\u0085good name. \n[64]I'm coming. \n[65]Good luck with yours, Kit. \n[66]This is a different one. \n[67]I did not. \n[68]Tomorrow \n[69]please God. \n[70]Your name? \n[71]Take off your hat. \n[72]Where did you learn how to do that? \n[73]Wait there. \n[74]Let me see you. Take off your hat. \n[75]Where's the boy? \n[76]Follow that boat! \n[77]Yes. \n[78]Really? \n[79]Do you know that house? \n[80]The actor \n[81]William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and playwright of the Rose. \n[82]I will wait. \n[83]Master Plum! What business here? \n[84]I seek Master Thomas Kent. \n[85]By all the stars in heaven, who is she? \n[86]anaesthetic and not noticing the danger \n[87]How do I offend, my lord? \n[88]Christopher Marlowe at your service. \n[89]My lady! \n[90]Will Shakespeare! \n[91]The same, alas. \n[92]A lowly player. \n[93]Oh--I am him too! \n[94]Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be punished for this! \n[95]Oh my lady, my love! \n[96]You can bring them with a word. \n[97]We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. \n[98]Who are you, master? \n[99]I'll be damned if you are! \n[100]Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome. \n[101]We are about to embark on a great voyage. \n[102]You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go \n[103]We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona \n[104]Mercutio \n[105]Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again? \n[106]But your voice Have they dropped? \n[107]Master Henslowe, you have your actors. \n[108]Yes, I saw it. \n[109]Better fortune, boy. \n[110]You admire it? \n[111]Oh. What is your name? \n[112]I have to get back. \n[113]Cut round him for now. \n[114]Romeo. \n[115]What? \n[116]Good \n[117]No, no, no\u0085Don't spend it all at once! \n[118]Do you understand me? \n[119]He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? \n[120]God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life? \n[121]Of course you have not! I have not written it! \n[122]Go once more! \n[123]Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write. \n[124]You did not like the speech? \n[125]There you have his duel, a skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion and poetry as your ever heard: \"a plague on both your houses!\" \n[126]Did you give her my letter? \n[127]Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. \n[128]Row your boat. \n[129]She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? \n[130]And break her heart and mine? \n[131]She loves me, Thomas! \n[132]No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? \n[133]Your aunt? \n[134]Like a sickness and its cure together. \n[135]Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. \n[136]Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! \n[137]Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. \n[138]Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? \n[139]Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! \n[140]Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! \n[141]For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! \n[142]Lady? \n[143]Can you love a fool? \n[144]Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent. \n[145]I am. \n[146]It is strange to me, too. \n[147]There is. \n[148]Oh \n[149]Well perhaps better than my first. \n[150]I must. Look-- how pale the window. \n[151]No, the morning rooster woke me. \n[152]Oh, let Henslowe wait. \n[153]Let him be damned for his pages! \n[154]There is time. It is still dark. \n[155]It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. \n[156]Yes\u0085yes\u0085er\u0085not quite right\u0085it is more let me \"Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\" \n[157]Yes, yes\u0085continue. Now the Nurse. Where is Ralph? \n[158]I must. I must \n[159]Yes, some of it is speakable. \n[160]\"Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name.\" \n[161]\"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsel?\" \n[162]\"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee.\" \n[163]\"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\" \n[164]Oh, but it is mine too! \n[165]\"My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep: \n[166]\"Stay but a little, I will come again.\" \n[167]How is it? \n[168]Ned\u0085I know\u0085I know \n[169]Oh \n[170]Ah \n[171]Thank you, Ned. \n[172]You are a gentleman. \n[173]Sunday\u0085it is Sunday. \n[174]I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies. \n[175]In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature. \n[176]You cannot! Not for the Queen herself! \n[177]To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day. \n[178]Then I will go with you. \n[179]I know how to fight! \n[180]Here we come at last, my lord! \n[181]Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! \n[182]Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches! \n[183]A man, my lord? \n[184]A theatre poet? \n[185]Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. \n[186]Fifty pounds! \n[187]What is this rabble?! \n[188]A literary feud. Quite normal. \n[189]Stay hid! \n[190]I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were cast ashore in a far country. \n[191]Is this a tavern? \n[192]It is also a tavern. \n[193]It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink. \n[194]Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role. \n[195]By God, I wish I knew. \n[196]Oh\u0085what have I done? \n[197]It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God forgive me! \n[198]It is worse. I have killed a man. \n[199]Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. \n[200]He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. \n[201]My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. \n[202]I was the more deceived. \n[203]Now? \n[204]Oh, my love You ran from me before. \n[205]You cannot marry Wessex! \n[206]No\u0085no. \n[207]For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt, the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished \n[208]but the Friar who married Romeo and Juliet \n[209]You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again. \n[210]I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. \n[211]And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. \n[212]And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills herself. \n[213]The play. All written out for you. I had the clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering. \n[214]There's a new scene \n[215]\"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day&gt; It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.\" \n[216]\"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer\u0085\" \n[217]\"\u0085thou need'st not to be gone.\" \n[218]You are on my ground. \n[219]I am more than enough. \n[220]Absent friends! This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe! \n[221]Oh God, I am free of it! \n[222]We are lost. \n[223]How will it? \n[224]Wonderful! \n[225]Luck be with you, Sam. Sam\u0085? \n[226]Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. \n[227]What do we do now? \n[228]Go on. \n[229]How will it? \n[230]I am fortune's fool. \n[231]You are married? \n[232]If you be married, my gave is like to be my wedding bed. The implication of her silence fills the air. WILL does not move. \n[233]My Lady Wessex? \n[234]I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us. \n[235]I have hurt you and I am sorry for it. \n[236]A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love? \n[237]Sold in marriage and half way to America. \n[238]Orsino\u0085good name \n[239]and thus unable to declare her love \n[240]How does it? \n[241]You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die. \n[242]Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye. \n[243]My story starts at sea\u0085a perilous voyage to an unknown land\u0085a shipwreck \n[244]the wild waters roar and heave\u0085the brave vessel is dashed all to pieces, and all the helpless souls within her drowned \n[245]all save one \u0085 a lady \n[246]whose soul is greater than the ocean \u0085 and her spirit stronger than the sea's embrace \u0085 not for her watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore \n[247]It will be a love story \u0085 for she will be my heroine for all time \n[248]and her name will be \u0085 Viola. ", "VIOLA": "\n[1]Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks. \n[2]But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another? \n[3]But at the playhouse. Nurse? \n[4]I am not so well-born. \n[5]All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. \n[6]No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . . \n[7]But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players. \n[8]God save you, mother. Ho water, nurse. \n[9]He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. \n[10]A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King! \n[11]From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome? \n[12]Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming. \n[13]You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig! \n[14]Master Shakespeare \n[15]My lord. \n[16]So my lord? I speak with him every day. \n[17]Good sir\u0085 ? \n[18]I heard you are a poet. \n[19]But a poet of no words? \n[20]Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of Verona. A comedy. By William Shakespeare. \n[21]Who is there? \n[22]Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?! \n[23]Oh but why \"alas?\" \n[24]Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart. \n[25]Anon, anon! I will come again. \n[26]If they find you here they will kill you. \n[27]Oh, not for the world! \n[28]Anon, nurse! \n[29]Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. \n[30]You flatter, my lord. \n[31]Do you intend to marry, my lord? \n[32]I do not love you, my lord. \n[33]Virginia?! \n[34]But why me? \n[35]The Queen has consented? \n[36]I will do my duty, my lord. \n[37]Oh, Will! \n[38]Can you love a player? \n[39]Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare? \n[40]Then kiss me again for I am not mistook. \n[41]I do not know how to undress a man. \n[42]I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. \n[43]Even your play. \n[44]And that was only my first try. \n[45]Will \n[46]You would not leave me? \n[47]Moonlight! \n[48]It was the owl--come to bed \n[49]Mr. Henslowe? \n[50]Oh--no, no! \n[51]It is broad day! The rooster tells us so! \n[52]You would leave us players without a scene to read today?! \n[53]It is a new world! \n[54]Oh let it be night! \n[55]Oh, do not go \n[56]\"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!\" \n[57]\"Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she\u0085\" \n[58]Oh, Will! \n[59]\"It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she knew she were!\" \n[60]That's my line! \n[61]Anon, good Nurse \n[62]\"I am feared, \n[63]Oh, but it will end well for love? \n[64]Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season. \n[65]Sunday! Greenwich! \n[66]What will you have me do? Marry you instead? \n[67]You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go. \n[68]You cannot, Wessex will kill you \n[69]Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday. \n[70]Good morning, my lord! \n[71]Your Majesty. \n[72]Your Majesty. \n[73]Your Majesty \n[74]I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed \n[75]And I love poetry above all. \n[76]Oh, but they can! \n[77]I mean\u0085Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can \n[78]Will! What--? \n[79]It is not my riding day, my lord. \n[80]I am going to church. \n[81]It is to be expected on a Sunday. \n[82]Mourning? Who is dead, my lord? \n[83]He is dead? \n[84]Will! \n[85]Oh, my love, I thought you were dead! \n[86]You never spoke so well of him. \n[87]You lie. \n[88]You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed. \n[89]Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet. \n[90]I love you, Will, beyond poetry. \n[91]You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. \n[92]If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare. \n[93]But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified. \n[94]Will you read it for me? \n[95]\"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.

It is not day.\" \n[97]Nobody knew! \n[98]I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will. \n[99]Thank you. \n[100]Good morning, my lord. I see you are open for business so let's to church. \n[101]No Juliet?! \n[102]What happened to Sam? \n[103]Thomas Kent! \n[104]Every word. \n[105]A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love. \n[106]It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise. \n[107]If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier. \n[108]The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night. \n[109]An excellent beginning Let him be\u0085a duke. And your heroine? \n[110]At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?\u0085she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke\u0085Orsino. \n[111]But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy \n[112]But all ends well. \n[113]I don't know. It's a mystery \n[114]Nor you for me. \n[115]Write me well. ", "HENSLOWE": "\n[1]Aaagh! I can pay you! \n[2]Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake. \n[3]I have a wonderful new play! \n[4]It's a comedy. \n[5]A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare! \n[6]And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman! \n[7]It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant. \n[8]This time it is by Shakespeare. \n[9]Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. \n[10]But I have to pay the actors and the authors. \n[11]There's never any \n[12]Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something. \n[13]Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment. \n[14]Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun? \n[15]No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play? \n[16]God be praised! Locked? \n[17]Who is she this time?! \n[18]Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet? \n[19]Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful - \n[20]No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel? \n[21]Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since. \n[22]. . . Will! What is money to you and me? I, your patron, you my wordwright! When the plague lifts Burbage will have a new Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain and I have nothing for the Rose. \n[23]Fifty pounds? What for? \n[24]Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs! \n[25]Where are you going? \n[26]Now where? Will? \n[27]Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket. \n[28]And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you? \n[29]Is it about a pirate's daughter? \n[30]You see? Comedy. \n[31]Love and a bit with a dog, that's what they like. \n[32]There's a lady knows your play by heart. \n[33]What have I done, Mr. Fennyman? \n[34]Oh, that. \n[35]Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

You mean Ethel. \n[64]A sonnet? You mean a play. \n[65]You mean, no dog of any kind? \n[66]That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King. \n[67]Not with my props! \n[68]We need that for the balcony scene! \n[69]My poor Rose! \n[70]I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman.
