Miami- Dade P.D.  Patch me through to your Special Agent in Charge, James Fujima?  It's an emergency... \n[26]I said, \"emergency.\"  If he's not reachable, who's running the weekend?  The ASAC? \n[27]Listen carefully. \n[28]An informant who is working one of YOUR cases right now called me. YOU may have a problem.  So get me somebody on the other end of this telephone who knows what the hell I'm talking about...! \n[29]Hello? \n[30]Detective Crockett. \n[31]4-4-7 Charlie 12-92. \n[32]A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now... \n[33]How do I know? I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here. You know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not. But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word \"foreboding\"? As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now? \n[34]\"Buy and walk\"?  \"Buy and bust\"? \"Reverse undercover\"?  What? \n[35]And the deal goes down at another place at another time. \n[36]...so there's no industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight? \n[37]OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs? \n[38]He is saying they had him from the gate.  He is saying to my partner and I and to his family \"goodbye.\" What does that tell you? \n[39]How'd they get onto you? \n[40]They been known to do that... \n[41]White gangs...?

Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group. \n[52]He is fine.  And we know the jokes. messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die... Everybody gets it. \n[53]Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull? \n[54]tosses two Willie Peters  into the boats.

Yeah, later. \n[56]We're from Nicholas to meet Jos\u00e9... \n[57]Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico. \n[58]Dos caf\u00e9. \n[59]What...? \n[60]My mommy and daddy know me. \n[61]That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time. \n[62]You want to \"know\" shit?  Who the fuck are you?  You got a side deal with U.S. Customs to open up the \n[63]Or DEA?  The Feeb? \n[64]\"No, viejo.

This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy? \n[74]Satellite.  New encryption. Supposedly sharper than the G...

He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the bench.  A matchstick goes against the closed closet door.  A ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone. \n[79]loads a .45 \"race\" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the small of his back.  They're ready. \n[80]Who knows... \n[81]Really?  So, what is this, a party? \n[82]Glad we came.  This place is a lot of fun if you're Doctors Without Borders.  So...? \n[83]I thought we had to meet the Man. \n[84]When? \n[85]has seen something else.  He indicates the pager on his waist. \n[86]eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban area?  Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over Baghdad.  It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a dope deal. \n[87]gestures to Tubbs to look up.  They see... \n[88]in the town square, now, too.  But Isabella stayed inside Montoya's Suburban.  Now, she lowers her window. \n[89]holds that look. \n[90]Sound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell phone. \n[91]We set. \n[92]You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind? \n[93]Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me phony denials? \n[94]No. \n[95]Transglobal Airlines flight zero- zero-zero...is in the air... \n[96]Neptune gonna show? \n[97]Usually his thing is street dealers.  Torture their families until they cough up the stash. This...? \n[98]Here's another incognito genius... \n[99]\"Extras\" tried to relieve us of your weight... And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of \"Things Aquatic\"? \n[100]He tried to...\"do business\"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there. \n[101]Look familiar? \n[102]Yeah. \n[103]How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours? \n[104]He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set. So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations? \n[105]Okay. \n[106]Nothing. \n[107]Nothing.  As in \"free, gratis.\" \n[108]A fine...business...relationship... \n[109]There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product... \n[110]Let me buy you a drink. \n[111]I'm a fiend for mojitas. \n[112]It goes very fast. \n[113]I know what I'm doing. \n[114]So where's the best place for mojitas? \n[115]Where's that? \n[116]The Keys? \n[117]Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business... \n[118]waves her over to join him behind the wheel.  He holds out his left hand to steady her.  He brings her to him.  Both lean against his high upholstered chair.  He holds her to his side.  Indicates the wheel... \n[119]Light touch.  Everything comes to you through the wheel. \n[120]stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward when reentering.  The swells are now four feet.  They launch off each, get airborne, cut into the next... \n[121]How do we get into Cuba?! \n[122]You do business in Cuba with your husband? \n[123]Were you born in Havana? \n[124]Where's she now? \n[125]Your father? \n[126]How's he not your husband? \n[127]can't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her... And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her. And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn away... \n[128]his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel. She rocks back against his body.  They rip across the seas... \n[129]Mojitas...? \n[130]I dance... \n[131]hears voices from the interior. \n[132]No. \n[133]Okay. Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business... \n[134]My friend, two more. What was your mother's name...? \n[135]Died in childbirth, having me... \n[136]You know how improbable this is...? \n[137]...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow. \n[138]...and therafore there is no consequence? \n[139]Let's talk deliveries. \n[140]...and a different kind of deal. \n[141]Like \"three thousand a ki?\"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers. \n[142]Cost less.  That's the point. \n[143]What do you mean? \n[144]Better than that. We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  \"And why,\" you're thinking, \"would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?\"  And the answer is, \"of course\" but also \"no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can.\" \n[145]Zero risk. \n[146]'Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free. \n[147]Then I would say to you, this has been fun... \n[148]I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... \n[149]Twenty-eight-point-five. \n[150]I would say you're... ...four percentage points away from a deal... \n[151]We'll do it at twenty-two... \n[152]...and now what? \n[153]Rain and wind rip across his face.  He left Isabella in Havana. \n[154]On my way back... \n[155]Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place. \n[156]Verdado. \n[157]It's in the suburbs outside Havana. \n[158]No.  Havana, Louisiana. Don't we have a meet? \n[159]No. \n[160]We're makin' moves on each other. \n[161]Who's the \"we\"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  \"Low-level producer.\"  Yeah, right... \n[162]Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade. \n[163]Yeah.  CIA-level stuff... \n[164]Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow... \n[165]Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe. \n[166]And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out. \n[167]Keys to the boat.  Go do this motherfucker yourself. \n[168]Hey, fuck him. \n[169]We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC... \n[170]I'm my own man.  And anytime you \n[171]As in...? \n[172]You think I am in so deep I forgot? \n[173]Do you believe...I have forgotten I am a cop? \n[174]No, I do not. \n[175]emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane. \n[176]Hola, chica. \n[177]Now how we do it, blood.  It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing. \n[178]Packaging? \n[179]If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy... \n[180]And the chopsticks and fortune cookies? \n[181]They're all the same.  \"Financial security is around the corner.\" \"Your friends love you.\" \n[182]Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts? \n[183]...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance. \n[184]Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate. \n[185]Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them. So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run... \n[186]Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can. \n[187]Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner. \n[188]Of course. \n[189]Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there... \n[190]This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you. \n[191]A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you. \n[192]...in the morning. \n[193]Go ahead. \n[194]Switek? \n[195]What's your take? \n[196]Call the US Coast Guard:  \"Come and arrest our ass.\" And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine... \n[197]Then you should. \n[198]Yeah? \n[199]You got something to say, Jos\u00e9, let's hear it. \n[200]What friend? \n[201]Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive? \n[202]Yero doesn't know she's here! \n[203]Yero, by himself? \n[204]Dump the rest.  Let's get the boats up that river. \n[205]Jos\u00e9 Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina. \n[206]They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment... \n[207]It's a rip and a hit. \n[208]You can't. \n[209]Supposedly it's coming. \n[210]Just came in.  She's still alive. \n[211]...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed. \n[212]sees Isabella, moves. \n[213]Isabella!! \n[214]goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police. OK, how will they get out of here? \n[215]Touch the windshield with your hands.  Let 'em see your hands are empty.  Steady. \n[216]Yeah.  Hey, Robert. \n[217]Yeah.  Going to Miami General. Check out Gina.  Everybody's okay. Everybody's fine... \n[218]Isabella...? \n[219]No. \n[220]No part of it wasn't real. \n[221]It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you. Just like I said. And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will. \n[222]Luck ran out. This was too good to last.

It's all cool. But I need a vector, not a location.  'Cause ships move. That's why they call them ships. Ship stops?  It's trying to be an apartment building.  At sea that attracts attention.  That's bad... \n[105]Where the hell are you, man? \n[106]The meet with Castillo and the fed got set up.

His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis. Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming capability... \n[115]And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you? \n[116]Their loads are poly-drug.  \"E\" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan \"H.\" Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network. \n[117]So we want to change-up the mission statement. \n[118]He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization... \n[119]Chill out Sonny. \n[120]With Sonny.  110%. \n[121]What is going on...?! \n[122]There is \"undercover.\"  And there is \"Which way is up?\" \n[123]I am asking.  You to me. \n[124]I would never doubt you. \n[125]And do you doubt I will slot anyone complicit in the death of Maria, Alonzo and those children? Anyone...whoever they are... \n[126]Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... \n[127]At ten to three on the 27th, I will satellite page him with a website and encryption code.  He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading.  Ten minutes and thirty seconds, website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland... \n[128]Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki... \n[129]And Jos\u00e9, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea. So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...? \n[130]What's the point?  It's going down. \n[131]Yeah.

Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000. Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load. Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil... That's the deal. \n[4]You do. \n[5]Right now. \n[6]We want it back. \n[7]What's the recovery?

Cause you're with me. \n[21]My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat... \n[22]I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband... \n[23]Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too... ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there... \n[24]She's dead... \n[25]Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...? \n[26]Go ahead and ask... \n[27]I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.

Crockett looks back at her. Their eyes connect. \n[29]Later!  Do you dance? \n[30]My aunt.  She's ancient.  She looks after the place... This was my mother's family's home... \n[31]Tell me everything. \n[32]I insist. \n[33]Blanca...a rubio like you. I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting. ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone... She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance. Your mother? \n[34]To mothers.  And all that we owe them... \n[35]\"Probable\"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here. \n[36]That's right. \n[37]Exactly. \n[38]enters.  She touches his back.  He turns to her with a smile. \n[39]Like...? \n[40]And why should continuing excellence cost more? \n[41]Is it December? \n[42]Did Christmas come early this year...? \n[43]Good samba dancing...? \n[44]'Cause you don't lose loads? \n[45]And you're our thirty-percent partner? \n[46]What if I tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin? That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing? \n[47]The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. \n[48]Available cash is not an issue for us... \n[49]What if I pushed to twenty-one...? \n[50]Maybe I'm only one. \n[51]And now I make you breakfast again... \n[52]...90- and 120-day futures with shorted Canadian and US dollars... \n[53]...and we're looking at Nigerian crude... \n[54]Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship. \n[55]They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now. \n[56]Burnett? They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital. \n[57]My \"intuition\"...?  My intuition made him breakfast the other morning in Havana. \n[58]They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good. \n[59]But they have to be watched closely... \n[60]A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious. \n[61]So I predict a few good runs.  Then there'll be a renegotiation. \n[62]I think Jos\u00e9 suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too... \n[63]I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior.... \n[64]On the other hand...if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba...the lead?  Then let's do that.  Accept their deal.  After the load is received...we will close their eyes forever... \n[65]Hola, viejo. \n[66]Don't stop, bad man... \n[67]I forgot the napkins. \n[68]What's the best fortune you ever got? \n[69]In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, \"Live now because life is dust.\" \n[70]Why? \n[71]Do I need it? \n[72]'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...? \n[73]Really? \n[74]When? \n[75]Would you find me...? \n[76]Where would I go? \n[77]Is this the protective male talk? \n[78]And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...? \n[79]Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen. But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load... \n[80]I'll be on board by noon. \n[81]What did you think?  This deal with you is my deal.  I am responsible. \n[82]That sonofabitch! \n[83]Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap. \n[84]It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos\u00e9 knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story. \n[85]They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too. \n[86]Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites. \n[87]If they attack you... \n[88]runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.  She's shouting in Spanish.  It's insane. \n[89]thinks this is it.  She's dead.  SWAT, shotguns and assault rifles, approach. \n[90]stares at him.  Incredulous.  For the first time she realizes he's the police and has been undercover.  And now she hits him... \n[91]What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it? \n[92]I know. And now? \n[93]You said time is luck... ", "JOS\u00c9 YERO": "\n[1]Jos\u00e9... \n[2]Sit. \n[3]Nicholas said you okay.

But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda. \n[21]What'd Neptune tell you? \n[22]Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load... \n[23]They are \"wrong.\"  I do not trust them. \n[24]Too good at what they do, I don't know.  Something I don't like. They are wrong... \n[25]He watches them, too.  His yellow eyes are lit by strobes. His eyes locked onto Isabella...dancing with Crockett, their bodies close... And in the way he looks at them, hurt, like a betrayed lover, which he isn't and never could have been...we know now, the core of his antagonism. \n[26]Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. \n[27]You give yours to me.  We position all the assets hauling our loads... \n[28]Malaysian registry.  Small containership. Give them their codes and heading. \n[29]Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat. \n[30]You work that out with La Senora. You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say. I'm sure you have friends with fast boats... \n[31]Sure.  Check your e-mail. \n[32]You know what Escobar used to do? \n[33]In the '80's, air routes came into favor.  It required many pilots. The best were American.  Former crop-dusters.  They didn't fly by the book.  Tell one:  \"Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway.\"  Somehow, he'd do it. Great pilots.  But Pablo had a rule.  After they flew six loads...this good pilot who facilitates so much good business... he would come back to Medell\u00edn or Barranquilla to pick up the next load? And no one would ever see him again.  He'd disappear. \"You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo? Thank you very much.\"  And then Pablo would kill his ass.  After six loads. And who was Pablo Escobar?  A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali.  When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We're three times better than Pablo Escobar. The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner. And do you know why Pablo Escobar did that? \n[34]He didn't like pilots. \n[35]And put eyes on her.  Put eyes on her twenty-four hours a day... \n[36]Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts. \n[37]I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view. I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now... \n[38]So I want you to deliver my product, how I want my product delivered. \n[39]Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you. \n[40]So, I will tell you when you're 10 minutes out where to drop the load into the hands of my people.  You have 35 minutes to enter Government Channel.  Head up the River...  We will watch you.  Then I will call you.

What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown. \n[19]But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.
