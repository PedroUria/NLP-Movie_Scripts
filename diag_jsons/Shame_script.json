At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him. He recoils, unable to continue. Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up. MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her skirt, adjusts her hair. \n[73]Brandon? Erm... \n[74]You know, it's cool. It's OK. \n[75]Should I go? \n[76]That's OK.
