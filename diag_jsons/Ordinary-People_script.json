Oh, I got seventy four on a trig quiz. \n[98]Oh? Did you...? You took Trig? \n[99]So what do I do... tell you my dreams? \n[100]What kind of a psychiatrist are you? They all believe in dreams. \n[101]I just feel... I feel so... \n[102]Jumpy. I don't know. \n[103]Maybe I need a tranquilizer. \n[104]Yeah. \n[105]What is this? \n[106]Oh, I see. So you get to tell the time, but I can't. Is that it? \n[107]So you know when the hour's up? \n[108]Fifty minutes, fifty five minutes? What is it? \n[109]Maybe... Maybe I don't want to swim anymore. You know, I mean my timing is for shit. You know, he's got two guys that swim the fifty, they're better than me, and... \n[110]They're a bunch of boring ass jocks. \n[111]And him...

I mean, you're a doctor, I'm supposed to feel better! Right? \n[120]No. It's still hard. \n[121]The hospital was. \n[122]Because nobody hid anything there. \n[123]Uh-huh. \n[124]Uh-huh. \n[125]Whoa! \n[126]Hey, Karen! Hi! How are you? \n[127]Sit down. Please. \n[128]Wow. \n[129]Uh... The end of August. \n[130]It's great to see you. \n[131]Don't let me hang you up. \n[132]No, no, I wasn't. It was just a gray day, that's all. Kind of... But everything's great, I'm back in school, I am on the swim team, and... \n[133]We haven't had any meets yet. I could end up on the bench all year, but... \n[134]Yeah, yeah. \n[135]You're hungry, at all? \n[136]Uh...   two cokes, please. \n[137]Something I said? Definitely a low self-image day. \n[138]You really look beautiful. \n[139]Do you miss it? \n[140]The hospital. \n[141]You don't miss it? At all? Nothing? Nothing about it? \n[142]You don't miss Leo's corny jokes? \n[143]Yeah. I'm seeing a doctor. Are you? \n[144]Well, ya, I don't know how long I'll keep it up. I sorta got shoved into it. \n[145]Oh, yes. That was such a dumb thing to do. \n[146]You do? \n[147]I don't know, I just... Uh... I miss it sometimes, the hospital. Really do. \n[148]But that's where we had the laughs. \n[149]Yeah, yeah, I... you're sure right. \n[150]I know, you told me. \n[151]Yeah. \n[152]Thanks for seeing me. \n[153]Yeah... Yeah. \n[154]Yeah... \n[155]Yep! \n[156]Yeah. \n[157]Bye-bye. \n[158]Do I need one? \n[159]Nothing. Thinking. \n[160]Not about anything. \n[161]I was thinking about the pigeon... You know the one that used to hang around the garage. How it used to get on top of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway. \n[162]Yeah. That was the closest we ever came to having a pet. You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into... getting a dog. Do you remember that? He said. \"How about it, if it's the size of a little football?\" \n[163]Pippin. Pippin. Pippin! \n[164]Arf! Arf! Arf! \n[165]Can I help? \n[166]I will. \n[167]Mom... \n[168]We just don't connect. \n[169]I don't know. We just don't. \n[170]That I jack off a lot. \n[171]For a minute. \n[172]John Boy. \n[173]You know, in \"The Waltons\". John Boy? \n[174]My father came into my room and he didn't know what to say. This is right after Buck died. And he came over and sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder. We just sat there. I remember I was watching his shoe. And thinking... Cos his shoe was turned over on its side. I was thinking: \"He's so uptight, it's gonna crack off.\" \n[175]And I knew I should have felt something. But I didn't know what to feel. I kept thinking what they say on TV, you know, stuff like: \n[176]\"Oh, no, noo! Ooh, My god!\" But I didn't say that... because I didn't feel sad... so much as... \n[177]I dunno. I kept thinking that John Boy would've said something...about the way he felt, you know. Something. \n[178]I don't know. \n[179]Come on what? \n[180]I'm not asking you for anything. \n[181]Nothing. \n[182]I don't think that ...that quitting swimming will mess up my life. I... I really don't. \n[183]Yeah. \n[184]Uh, uh. \n[185]Okay! \n[186]I won't ask you to    ...sir. \n[187]Yeah. \n[188]Yeah. \n[189]I don't know. I felt like it was a bore. \n[190]Well, that's the way it is. \n[191]Nothing. \n[192]Nothing. \n[193]Nothing. Swimming's a bore. That's all. \n[194]Well, quit talking to people! Okay? \n[195]I haven't told him yet. \n[196]I don't know. The timing isn't right, you know. He sweats everything so much, he'll just get worried about it. \n[197]My mother? My mother and I don't connect. Don't you listen? I told you that. \n[198]What do people have in common with mothers anyway? It's all surface junk. You know: \"Clean your room, brush your teeth, get good grades, nah, nah, nah, veh...\" Hey, look, I'm just wasting money today. I am not gonna feel anything. I'm sorry. \n[199]What time is it? \n[200]I said I feel things. \n[201]Ah, God... Come on. \n[202]Sometimes. I don't know. \n[203]I don't? I'm not. \n[204]I don't! \n[205]What do you want? \n[206]Yeah, and if I don't have an answer you want me to make one up? \n[207]I said I have feelings. \n[208]Why you hassle me? Why are you trying to make me mad? \n[209]No! \n[210]What? \n[211]Well, fuck off! No. No, I can't, I can't do this. \n[212]I can't... \n[213]I can't do this. It takes too much energy to get mad! \n[214]When I let myself feel low, I feel as lousy. \n[215]Fuck you. Berger! \n[216]Fuck you. \n[217]Fuck you! \n[218]Jesus, you're really weird! What about you? What do you feel, huh? Do you jack off or jerk off? Whatever you call it? \n[219]What do I think? I think you married your fat lady... and you goona over fuck the daylights out of her! \n[220]Ah! Ha!   Ha... \n[221]Dad, give her the camera. \n[222]\n[223]Oh... \n[224]Ha, no. I... \n[225]Yeah? \n[226]How can you hear me sing if you're singing? \n[227]Oh? \n[228]Uh, uh... \n[229]Ha, ha?

I was wondering if maybe you'd like...to go out sometime? \n[246]Well, yeah, we wouldn't have to call it a real date. We could fake it sort of, to see how it goes.. \n[247]Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett... \n[248]Hi. What do you think? \n[249]Dad, I quit the swim team. \n[250]Nowhere. Around. The library mostly. \n[251]I don't know, I didn't think it mattered. \n[252]Don't you have that backwards? \n[253]I didn't lie! \n[254]Well don't then! Go to Europe! \n[255]Cos the only reason she cares, the only reason she gives a fuck about it... \n[256]...is because someone else knew about it first! \n[257]No! You tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing! And I know why she never came to the hospital, she's busy going to goddamn Spain and... goddamn Portugal! Why should she care if I'm hung up by the balls out there? \n[258]You never came to the hospital! \n[259]Yeah! She wouldn't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital! She would have come if Buck was in the hospital! \n[260]I need to sleep. \n[261]I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any of it. I am sorry. Please don't be mad. \n[262]I don't know what happened! I am sorry about it all. I am sorry about the whole thing. What I said, I didn't mean it. Just please tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will you? \n[263]Oh, God, no, I can't! Don't you see? I can't talk to her! \n[264]Ha! Because it doesn't change anything. It doesn't change the way she looks at me. \n[265]I don't mean just now. Don't you see? I don't mean just today. \n[266]Ha! I can't! Everything is German pudding with you , dad. You don't see things! \n[267]That she hates me! Can't you see that? \n[268]All right, all right. You're right. She doesn't. Please leave me alone, now. \n[269]Don't blame it on Burger, it's not his fault! \n[270]You're the doctor. \n[271]Okay. Okay. \n[272]Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled! \n[273]Lately? \n[274]Hey, come on, if you... Listen, I'm never gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right. If you think I'm gonna forgive... - that she's gonna forgive me... \n[275]I think I just figured something out. \n[276]Who it is who can't forgive who... \n[277]I've heard this all before. \n[278]I'm so tired. \n[279]So what do I do now? \n[280]You mean, like she can't love me? \n[281]But she loves my father. I know she loved my brother. It's me! \n[282]That's different. He feels responsible. Besides, he loves everybody. \n[283]What do you mean? \n[284]You mean me? \n[285]For trying to off myself? Don't you sit there and stare at me. What for? \n[286]What did I do? \n[287]What did I do? \n[288]Come on! \n[289]What do you mean? You're gonna pull the plug... Come on! What did I do? \n[290]Rules? What rules? Can't I have a few minutes? \n[291]Jesus! \n[292]It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things. \n[293]Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing! \n[294]She hates me! Can't you see that? \n[295]Hmm? \n[296]Oh, that's all right. \n[297]Well, listen. We don't have to go bowling if you'd rather not, I'm not a bowling nut or anything. How funny are you? \n[298]Hoo, that's pretty funny. Hey, well, listen, I promise you won't look silly. \n[299]Guarantee it. \n[300]Can't break the ball, can't break the floor, can't break anything in a bowling alley. And that's what I like about bowling alleys. Can't even break the record. \n[301]Anyway... \n[302]Just \"anyway\", it's a conversation starter. \n[303]You like it? \n[304]I thought it'd get to you. I've been working on it all day. \n[305]You mean by God? \n[306]Mmm, I don't believe in God. \n[307]No. Well, it's not a question of degree. Either you do or you don't. \n[308]So you're afraid he'll punish you for something you did? \n[309]Yeah? So have I. \n[310]No, I dunno, I don't remember really. \n[311]Ah, I don't know... I've never really talked about it. To doctors, but not to anyone else. You're the first who's asked. \n[312]Uh... I don't know. It was like... falling into a hole. It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger, .and you can't get out, and then, .all of a sudden, it's inside...and you're the hole, and you're trapped, and it's all over. Something like that. And it's not really scary, except it is when you think back on it. 'Cause you know what you were feeling stange and new... \n[313]Yeah, they were pretty funny. \n[314]What? You thought they were funny? \n[315]What for? \n[316]About what? \n[317]Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Uh... I'll give you a call. \n[318]Sure. \n[319]Okay. Yeah. Thanks. \n[320]I mean. Good night. Good night. \n[321]Oh. No. Thanks. \n[322]Oh, no, I don't think so. \n[323]Hey, do me a favor, Stillman, try not to be such a prick. \n[324]So? \n[325]So I look stupid, is that it? \n[326]I can't help it, it hurts too much to be around you. I gotta go. \n[327]Hello. Is Karen there? \n[328]Yes, hello. Is Karen there? This is Conrad Jarrett, calling. I'm a friend of hers. \n[329]What? What? \n[330]Ha! \n[331]Get the sail down!

I   don't know! \n[351]Okay. \n[352]Something happened... \n[353]I need...     I need... \n[354]Something happened! \n[355]It's... \n[356]Oh. God! I need something. \n[357]It just keeps coming! I can't... I can't make it stop! \n[358]I gotta... I gotta... I gotta get off the hook for it. I gotta get off the hook! \n[359]For what I did! \n[360]What I did to him! \n[361]It's something... It's something... Don't you see? It's gotta be somebody's fault or there's no godamm point! \n[362]No, no... Oh, no. I don't mean that. It's that... It's just that... Buck, Bucky, I didn't mean it! \n[363]Bucky, I didn't mean it! \n[364]Bucky! \n[365]But it was: you said. \"Get the sail down!\" ... \n[366]...and I couldn't! \n[367]I couldn't! It jammed! And then the halyard, the halyard jammed! I couldn't because the godamn halyard jammed! And then you're sittin' here, you're screwing around... \n[368]...until it's too late to do anything! And I'm supposed to take care of it! \n[369]And I'm supposed to take care of it! \n[370]No! And then you say ... \n[371]\"Hang on!\"... \n[372]...\"Hang on!\", and then you let go! \n[373]Why'd you let go? \n[374]Yeah? Well. Screw you, you jerk! \n[375]Yeah. He just wasn't careful. He just wouldn't care. He didn't see how a bad thing might happen. \n[376]We were screwing around out there, we should've come in when it started to look bad. \n[377]Why did he let go? Why? \n[378]Oh, God, I'd like to quit. \n[379]It's not easy. It's not that easy. God... I loved him. \n[380]Ka-ren. She killed herself!

She said she was... \n[383]She was busy, she was feeling good and she... \n[384]I just wish I'd known...I could've done something. \n[385]No! \n[386]No. I just... \n[387]That isn't it. I... I feel bad about this, I feel really bad about this. And just let me feel bad about this! \n[388]Why do things have to happen to people? It isn't fair. \n[389]You just do one wrong thing... and... \n[390]Haaa... \n[391]Haaa... \n[392]Haaa... \n[393]Haaa... \n[394]I hung on.

The way you used to for him. \n[423]Oh, Dad. Don't. \n[424]Well, I wasn't putting out many signals then. I don't think you could have done anything. \n[425]You know, I used to figure you had a handle for everything. You knew it all. \n[426]I know that wasn't fair but you always made us feel like everything was gonna be all right. I thought about that a lot lately. I really admire you for it. \n[427]I'm not disappointed. I love you.

Trouble sleeping? \n[7]You're sure? \n[8]Burning the midnight oil? \n[9]Okay. \n[10]You thought about calling that doctor? \n[11]Well, the month's up. I think we should stick to the plan. \n[12]Yeah. Okay. Don't worry about it. Get some sleep. By the way, I am working on those Michigan State tickets. \n[13]Yeah, they said they'll make it some evening soon. \n[14]\"Joey Georgella. New football coach for Trinity.\" \n[15]Did you check with Jane for the Michigan State tickets? \n[16]Con! \n[17]Will you drop those suits at the cleaners for me? \n[18]That's okay. Connie! \n[19]Conrad! \n[20]Here he is! \n[21]Did you sleep? \n[22]Hungry? \n[23]Yeah. \n[24]Breakfast, pal, remember? Main meal. Energy! \n[25]Wait a minute, Beth, Hang on. He's gonna eat it. Come on. It's French toast. \n[26]What are you doing? What are you doing? \n[27]You have to charm Mr. Herman. Did you charm him? You have to eat, Con. We just want you keep on getting stronger. \n[28]Are you okay? \n[29]Oh. Is he? Great! \n[30]Well. I don't see the old gang much anymore. I miss them. Bring them around... Phil, Don, and Dick Van Buren. We'll play some touch football on the lawn. \n[31]Con! \n[32]Well. Regionally. \n[33]I mean.. it's tragic. Really. Look at him now. He's lost everything. \n[34]It's not too dry. \n[35]What happened to little Harry? \n[36]That girl from the hospital, the one you painted with, she was from Skokie, wasn't she? \n[37]What was her name? \n[38]Sharon? \n[39]Karen. \n[40]Good god, not the Murrays... \n[41]I saw Mort Swain. His sister died. \n[42]The one with the restaurant. \n[43]I guess so. Why? \n[44]I don't know. Maybe she died in Idaho. Maybe Kansas City. \n[45]Berger? \n[46]Did you? \n[47]Good! You didn't say anything. Good! \n[48]When? \n[49]How did it go? \n[50]Don't worry about the money, it's okay. \n[51]Ah, it's okay. And it is necessary. What did you talk about? \n[52]What about your schedule? Will that be all right? \n[53]Mmm? \n[54]Maybe we shouldn't plan to go away right now. \n[55]Yeah. I know we talked about it, but the more I talk about it, the more the timing doesn't seem right. \n[56]I know. \n[57]He's just started with this doctor. \n[58]No. If he doesn't go through with this now, he might change his mind. \n[59]You talked to him about it? Does he want to go to London? \n[60]Who's gonna be there? \n[61]Why don't we just go to the movies instead? \n[62]That's not negative. That's unpredictable. Come on. Let's really go to the movies. \n[63]Really? \n[64]Beth wanted to go to the movies? \n[65]Hey. Partner. How are you? \n[66]Why? \n[67]Where is he going? \n[68]Jesus. \n[69]Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to these days? \n[70]He's great. Just great. \n[71]Oh! \n[72]No, no. No. No. He's... \n[73]There's a doctor in Highland Park... that he sees a couple of times a week. That kinda cuts into his social life. \n[74]He's great. Just great. \n[75]Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. No, no, just somebody to talk to... that's all. Kind of polish off the rough edges, that's all. \n[76]Mr. Great. That's me! \n[77]Hey? \n[78]I'm not drunk. \n[79]I dunno. Why not? \n[80]Come on, for most people, it's a status symbol, right up there with going to Europe. \n[81]I did not think it was that... \n[82]Whose privacy? \n[83]Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault. I just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it. \n[84]What? \n[85]Oh, I'm sorry. \n[86]Huh? \n[87]Connie's all right. He is. He's okay. \n[88]I'm not on the rack about him. \n[89]I can't argue with \"Who knows.\" \n[90]Thanks. \n[91]Hang on! \n[92]Wait, hang on! Whose sweater is it? \n[93]That's fair! \n[94]Conrad! Conrad! \n[95]That's good. \n[96]Connie. I want one of Connie and his mother. \n[97]Connie, move in a little closer to your mother. Okay... prize winner... \n[98]Portrait... \n[99]Page one, Lake Forrester... \n[100]Shoot, I didn't cock it. \n[101]Hold it. Connie, smile! \n[102]Just a second, smile! \n[103]No, I didn't get it yet , Beth. \n[104]I want a really good picture of the two of you, OK? \n[105]Not until I get a picture of the two of you. \n[106]I didn't see you there. What do you think? \n[107]Rawlins used to have such great Scotch pines. And they all look like skeletons this year. \n[108]What's wrong? \n[109]Hear what? \n[110]What? \n[111]Quit? When? Where have you been every night? \n[112]Why didn't you tell us, Connie? \n[113]What do you mean? Why wouldn't it matter? Of course it matters. And... \n[114]What was meant for you? \n[115]Connie! Now, Connie! Connie!... \n[116]Connie!... \n[117]Just stop it, Connie! ... \n[118]How   do you know she never came? You   know she came but she had the flu   and couldn't come inside, but she   came. \n[119]That's enough! That is enough! \n[120]What in hell has happened? \n[121]Somebody better go up there. \n[122]I am not going to apologize... \n[123]I am not apologizing. I'm trying to goddamn understand him! \n[124]Beth. Let's not fight. Okay? No fighting. Okay? Please. Let's go upstairs. \n[125]I want to talk to you. \n[126]In a minute... \n[127]I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to figure out what happened down there. \n[128]Why don't you tell her? \n[129]Why not? \n[130]She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team. I don't understand it myself. \n[131]What then? Explain it to me. \n[132]What things? \n[133]What things? Please, I want you to tell me. \n[134]Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad? \n[135]What about this Dr. Berger? Do you think he's helping you? \n[136]I'll be downstairs if you need me. \n[137]\n[138]See you later. \n[139]I want to be clear. \n[140]In the car, I was thinking: \"be clear.\". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry. \n[141]I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody. \n[142]I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here. \n[143]I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an \"A\" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems. \n[144]Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck! \n[145]No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the \"accident\". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it. \n[146]Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching. \n[147]Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what. \n[148]I feel like I'm sitting on a fence, and I don't like it. \n[149]Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him. \n[150]Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh... \n[151]Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it? \n[152]Me?    I   loved Buck. \n[153]For me you mean? \n[154]Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it? \n[155]I think I know why I came here. I think I came here to talk about myself. \n[156]This will sound strange. \n[157]Could we talk about Buck's funeral? \n[158]I know it'll seem trivial, but it's on my mind, or has been, and I'd just like to talk about it. \n[159]When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was... \n[160]Just let me get it off my chest,OK? \n[161]I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral? \n[162]Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen! \n[163]I just want to talk about something I always remembered. \n[164]Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it. \n[165]I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger. \n[166]I think we could all go and see him together. \n[167]He thinks it's a good idea. \n[168]Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open. \n[169]Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise. \n[170]I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point. \n[171]Huh, no... Could you give me a couple of minutes, please? \n[172]I do too. I want all of them to be nice Christmases \n[173]Okay.   Okay. \n[174]I love you, too. \n[175]Seven. \n[176]I'll never get over how flat it is here. I'll never get over... \n[177]Airplane scotch. \n[178]Boy, oh, boy. \n[179]Oh, these holes sure do love you. Oh boy, oh boy. \n[180]Pinehurst would be nice. I think Connie would like Pinehurst. \n[181]Well, you said \"vacation\", so I just assumed you meant him too. \n[182]I was gonna call him tonight. \n[183]Six. Let's finish this. \n[184]What you started. \n[185]What you started. \n[186]I think there is a point. \n[187]He isn't the problem. \n[188]No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you. \n[189]Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me? \n[190]Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you? \n[191]Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while! \n[192]Well, I'll tell you what he expects! \n[193]All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it. \n[194]I just try to keep this family together... \n[195]It's pretty early. You tired? \n[196]I hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you? \n[197]I don't... \n[198]You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about. \n[199]Tell me something. Do you love me? Do you really love me? \n[200]We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know. \n[201]Maybe it wasn't even Buck. Maybe it was just you. Maybe, finally, it was the best of you that you buried. \n[202]But whatever it was, I don't know who you are. I don't know what we've been playing at. So I was crying. \n[203]'t know if I love you anymore. And I don't know what I am going to do without that. \n[204]The yard looks smaller without leaves. \n[205]Your mother's going away for a while. \n[206]Back to Houston. Then I... I don't know. \n[207]No. \n[208]Don't do that! Don't do that to yourself! It's nobody's fault! Things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know. \n[209]I don't know why I'm yelling at you for... \n[210]Oh, yeah? \n[211]Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You were always so hard on yourself, I never had the heart. \n[212]No, it's the truth. I... I never worried about you. I just wasn't listening. \n[213]No, no, no, I should ...I should've got a handle on it somehow. \n[214]Well, don't admire people too much. They'll disappoint you sometimes. \n[215]I love you too. ", "BETH": "\n[1]Bev Walsh was wonderful. \n[2]Yes. \n[3]What was it you were you thinking about? \n[4]What about the Warrens, did you call them? \n[5]Yes. She'll talk to John. Where's Conrad? This'll get cold. \n[6]They won't be back by Saturday. \n[7]Morning. \n[8]It's French toast. It's your favorite. \n[9]You're not hungry, you're not hungry! \n[10]There's fresh fruit for you when you get home from school later. \n[11]You can't save French toast. \n[12]Listen, I've got to run. I'm playing at nine. Will you please call Mr. Herman about the shutters? I can't get anywhere with that man. \n[13]Was he actually a client of yours? \n[14]It's too bad. \n[15]Fish too dry? \n[16]They have a new mechanic at C&amp;S. \n[17]I don't know. I think he took a job in Skokie. Anyway, this new mechanic is so ...awkward. Is that shirt ripped? Leave it on the table in the hallway. \n[18]Conrad, do you want me to sign you up for round robin at the club? \n[19]Well, don't you think it's time to start? \n[20]Also, Calvin, we have to go to the Murrays on saturday, I couldn't get out of it, it's Clark's birthday. I bought him that book on wine. \n[21]The one from Idaho? \n[22]Did she die in Idaho? \n[23]You said she was always traveling. I just... wondered if she died in Idaho. \n[24]I didn't know you made an appointment. \n[25]Where's his office? \n[26]You're the scariest ghost I've ever seen! And the tiger and the witch... You all look just wonderful. Take an apple. \n[27]There you go. Be careful. \n[28]Good-bye. \n[29]The Cabbots. Little Julie's first time. God, she's so cute! \n[30]Know what I've been thinking? \n[31]That Christmas in London would be like something out of Dickens. We've never done that before, right? Christmas in London? \n[32]Yes, we talked about that.   We decided on that. \n[33]Calvin, we've always gone away at Christmas time. \n[34]I think...  I think it would be good for him too. Isn't it time we got back to normal? \n[35]Alright, so he'll miss three weeks. Why interrupt it? \n[36]Because I want to get away! I think we all should. It's important. \n[37]Alright then if he changes his mind, maybe it's not something that was right for him to do. \n[38]I don't think he knows what he wants to do. \n[39]\n[40]Don't do that! \n[41]Ha. I didn't think you were here \n[42]I didn't play golf, today. It's too cold. \n[43]I didn't play. \n[44]No, I mean, ...for the year it's colder. \n[45]Weren't you swimming today? \n[46]How'd it go? \n[47]Good. \n[48]Off. \n[49]Well, you have to work at that. \n[50]Seventy four? Gee, I was awful at trig. \n[51]Wait a minute... Did I take trig? That's... - uh...? I bought you two shirts. They're on your bed. \n[52]Well. The Murrays of course, and the Gunthers, and the Caines, and... the good old us. \n[53]Don't be negative. \n[54]Okay. \n[55]Okay. Yeah. Come on. Let's go. What's our excuse? \n[56]Good. Very good. \n[57]All right now, smile. \n[58]Hello Gladyce. Will you put that with the rest of them? \n[59]Oh, look, we're in time for the grand entrance! \n[60]Clark! Happy birthday! You look wonderful for a 75-year-old! \n[61]Is that new? \n[62]You did the mousse? It turned out well? \n[63]Hi there. \n[64]Good to see you, and where were you at the lunch last week? \n[65]Your hair looks wonderful. It's shorter, isn't it? I like that. \n[66]Good to see you! You look beautiful. As ever. \n[67]What are these hushed tones all about? \n[68]No. You didn't. You're so mean. Isn't he the meanest man you've met? \n[69]How are you. Darling? Is he falling asleep on you, yet? \n[70]You drink too much at parties, Calvin. \n[71]Why did you tell Annie Marshall that Conrad is seeing a psychiatrist? \n[72]Well for one thing, I don't think people hear that kind of thing very easily. \n[73]Well, I thought your blurting it out like that was in very bad taste... \n[74]Not to mention a violation of privacy! \n[75]Our privacy! The family's privacy! I think it is a very private matter. \n[76]It's cold out here. You should put that on, or do you want a sweater? \n[77]What are you doing? \n[78]About what? \n[79]Your hair is starting to grow out. It's looking... looking better. \n[80]Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember how scared I used to get... That whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap, flap!... Every time I started the car. \n[81]You know. Uh... That animal next door, that Pepper or Pippin, whatever its name is... \n[82]He's not a very friendly dog...    I... I don't care what Mr. McGreary says. \n[83]Put that on if you're gonna stay out here, okay? \n[84]Help what? Oh, you mean with this? No. \n[85]No, I tell you what you can do though. You can go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet. \n[86]Okay? Because it really is a mess. \n[87]Hello. /.../ Oh, hi! /.../ Yeah, , no, I didn't get there. I was swamped with work. How did it go? /.../ No, no, I'm not doing anything, just getting ready for dinner. Uh-huh. \n[88]Did she really? \n[89]Oh, Bucky! \n[90]No. Stop! \n[91]What is it? \n[92]No, I tell you what. Let's get the three men in there, and I'll take a picture of you. \n[93]Do it. \n[94]Calvin... \n[95]Calvin! \n[96]Calvin, give me the camera. \n[97]Come on, give me the camera. \n[98]No but I really want a shot of the three of you men. Give me the camera, Calvin. Please... \n[99]Cal? \n[100]Smile. \n[101]Who's hungry? I'll make the sandwiches. \n[102]I think it can be saved. \n[103]That was dumb. It was just so dumb. I don't think he's happy in school. \n[104]I don't think people want to be with him. He provokes people. \n[105]Thank you. \n[106]Yes, Mother, of course. \n[107]I think maybe he should go away to school. I just don't know how to deal with him any more. \n[108]I don't know. I suppose this doctor he's seeing. \n[109]A psychiatrist. \n[110]No... \n[111]Berger. \n[112]I dunno, I suppose he's Jewish. Maybe just German. \n[113]You know, I think this can be saved. It's a nice clean break. \n[114]Fine. \n[115]Very nice. \n[116]Why don't you ask him what's wrong? Maybe you won't have to hear it from Carol Lazenby. \n[117]Carol thought I knew. Cos why wouldn't I? It happened over a month ago. \n[118]No, that was meant for me, Calvin. \n[119]It's really important to try to hurt me. Isn't it? \n[120]Oh? And how do I hurt you? By embarrassing you in front of a friend? Poor Beth! She has no idea what her son is up to! He lies and she believes every word of it. \n[121]You did! You lied everytime you came into this house at 6:30 ! If it's starting all over again, the lying, the covering up, the disappearing for hours, I will not stand for it! I can't stand it! I really can't! \n[122]Maybe this is how they sit around and talk at the hospital, but we're not at the hospital now. \n[123]Buck never would've been in the hospital! \n[124]I won't do it again. I really won't do it. \n[125]Ah! Oh, god, that's the pattern, isn't it? He walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him. \n[126]Yes of course you are! You always do! You've been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital, only you don't see it! \n[127]Don't talk to me that way. Don't you talk to me the way he talks to you! \n[128]He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him... \n[129]You've been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital. And you just don't see that! \n[130]Buck never would have been in the hospital! \n[131]Hi! \n[132]Calvin? \n[133]What's the matter? \n[134]What happened? \n[135]What? \n[136]Why? \n[137]Calvin, what's the matter with you? \n[138]What could getting dressed for Buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now? \n[139]Ha, ha. \n[140]I won't listen to that! No one in their right mind would listen to that. \n[141]Why do you want to remind me of it? \n[142]It's all right. \n[143]Caroll! I'm fine. How are you? \n[144]I know. I'm so busy. I promise I'll call you soon and we'll have lunch. \n[145]How's Brad? Give him my love. \n[146]Isn't this madness?   It gets worse every year! \n[147]What? \n[148]Oh... No, no. No. Thanks. \n[149]We've got Bennett's, and Grant's and Foley's. Ha, Conrad should get something for my mother and father. He's not supposed to get something for his doctor, is he? \n[150]What? \n[151]Why? \n[152]Ho... He thinks it's a good idea? What does he know about me, about this family? I've never even met him. \n[153]About what? What are we gonna talk about? Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't want anymore changes in my life. For God's sake, hasn't enough happened? Let's just hold on to what we've got! \n[154]I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry. \n[155]I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong... \n[156]...running to experts every time something goes wrong. \n[157]I know you mean well. I want this to be a nice Christmas. \n[158]We need time together, Calvin. You and I. We have to get away. New Years'. We can spend some time in Houston with my brother and Audrey. You know, play a little golf. Relax. \n[159]I have already talked to Mother about it, and Conrad can stay with them. Please don't worry about it. Please, for his sake, don't indulge him. We need time together. Okay? \n[160]I love you. \n[161]Let's just give things time. Okay? \n[162]Yes...

How about that? \n[167]Oh, I do love that. \n[168]We should spend more time playing golf together, you know that? Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf. Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach... \n[169]Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex? \n[170]I'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here. \n[171]Hey, could we have a little drink before we head back? \n[172]What? \n[173]What I started? \n[174]Ha! There's no point discussing it. \n[175]He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away. \n[176]Isn't he? \n[177]No, no. Let's talk about what's bothering you. Cos' that's what you want, isn't it? \n[178]It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing. \n[179]No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it! \n[180]I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known. \n[181]What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: \"Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.\". I can't! \n[182]Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you? \n[183]I don't know what everyone wants from me anymore! \n[184]Happy? \n[185]Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy! \n[186]Calvin? \n[187]Why are you crying? \n[188]Can I, uh... Can I get you something? \n[189]What did you say? \n[190]Calvin.

Isn't she worried about you, too? \n[26]Well, as long as you're straight. \n[27]Yes. He   called me on the phone. He told me   your name and... he told me to look   for you. And, uh... he said you had   a brother who died. A... boating   accident, wasn't it? Want to tell   me about it? Well I suppose you talked this over with Crawford at the hospital. Right? \n[28]How did that go? \n[29]Why do you want to change? \n[30]Why? \n[31]Well. I'll tell you something. I'll be straight with you, okay? I'm not big on control. But it's your money. \n[32]So to speak. Okay... \n[33]Well. Control's a tough nut. \n[34]Well. That's a problem. How do we solve that? \n[35]Well. It's up to you. \n[36]Mm-mmm. \n[37]I don't hold much stock in dreams. \n[38]Really? What's happening? What's going on? \n[39]What? \n[40]Look. Kiddo... I lied. I do believe in dreams. Only sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake. Come on, something's bugging you, making you nervous. You're making me nervous. \n[41]Tranquilizer? \n[42]I think you came in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers. It's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer. \n[43]Clock. \n[44]Mmm, mmm. \n[45]Right. \n[46]Ha, ha. \n[47]Ha, ha. \n[48]Ah, ah?...

How does it feel? \n[53]Are you the same person you were last year? \n[54]That's why you need a tranquilizer? \n[55]No. It's up to you! \n[56]Not necessarily. How is it with your friends? Is it getting any easier? \n[57]Is anyplace easy? \n[58]It was? Why? \n[59]Was there anyone there you could talk to? \n[60]I mean, besides Dr. Crawford? \n[61]What do you expect from her? \n[62]Why not? \n[63]What are you thinking? \n[64]So what else is new? Does it help? \n[65]What now? \n[66]Who? \n[67]Yeah. What about him? \n[68]So much as what? \n[69]What would John Boy have said? \n[70]Come on. Come on. \n[71]Don't hold back. \n[72]So, what did your dad say about it? \n[73]How come? \n[74]Can you tell your mother? \n[75]No. Sorry's out. Come on, something's on your mind. \n[76]No, no, never mind the time. There's time. Look. Remember the contract? Control? Maybe there's some connection between control and uh... \u00ad what do we call it? - lack of feeling? Mmm? \n[77]When? \n[78]When? \n[79]Come on, come on, Jarrett, I thought you didn't like to fool around. \n[80]Like to play games, do you? \n[81]So? \n[82]I'll tell you what I want. I want you to leave \"I don't know\" out there on the table with the magazines. Okay? \n[83]Yeah. That would be nice. Make one up. Right now. About how there's no feelings in there. \n[84]Oh! Now you have, now you don't! Get it together, Jarrett. \n[85]Are you mad? \n[86]Oh, cut the shit! You're mad! You're mad as hell! You don't like being pushed. So why don't you do something about it! \n[87]Tell me to fuck off! I don't know. \n[88]Why not? \n[89]Why not? \n[90]Do you know how much energy it takes to hold it back? \n[91]Oh! I beg your pardon! I never promised you a rose garden... \n[92]What? \n[93]Yeah? \n[94]That's it! \n[95]What do you think? \n[96]Sounds good to me. \n[97]A little advice about feeling, kiddo... Don't expect it always to tickle. \n[98]Tuesday you felt great. You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay? \n[99]Don't take refuge in one-liners like \"You're the doctor\". Okay? Because that pisses me off. \n[100]So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy. \n[101]What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit? \n[102]Come on. You must be able to come up with at least one example. And don't give me \"I tried to kill myself\", that's old turkey. What have you done lately? \n[103]Uh, uh. \n[104]What? \n[105]What? \n[106]Well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution. \n[107]Doesn't make it any less true. \n[108]Yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself. \n[109]Recognize her limitations. \n[110]Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love you enough. Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able. \n[111]Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that? \n[112]Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels. \n[113]I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive. \n[114]Why don't you give yourself a break? Let yourself off the hook? \n[115]We'll talk about it on Thursday. \n[116]Time's up. \n[117]Come on, Con. You know the rules. \n[118]You think about it. Just think about it. \n[119]That's good. \n[120]Okay. \n[121]Neither do I. \n[122]Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that? \n[123]But you still feel responsible? \n[124]You think of yourself as a lucky man, then? \n[125]That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney. \n[126]What would you want to do about that? \n[127]And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence? \n[128]For what? \n[129]Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck? \n[130]And you? \n[131]What I mean is, your wife's affection. \n[132]Yes. \n[133]Mm-hmm.   Very private. \n[134]Okay. Why don't we? \n[135]Hello? \n[136]What's going on? \n[137]What time is it? \n[138]Where are you? \n[139]All right. Listen to me.

Tell me! \n[149]Don't try. \n[150]For what? \n[151]What did you do? \n[152]What did you do? \n[153]Point? What point? It happened! \n[154]I know that, it wasn't your fault. \n[155]And that wasn't fair, was it? \n[156]Because I got tired! \n[157]It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it? \n[158]Bad things happen even when people are careful. \n[159]OK, so you made a mistake. \n[160]Maybe you were stronger.

You said something happened.

Listen. I feel bad about it too. \n[174]You're right. It isn't fair. \n[175]Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing you did? \n[176]You know. \n[177]You know. \n[178]Exactly. \n[179]Now. You can live with that. Can't you? \n[180]Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying? \n[181]You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that. \n[182]It is good. Believe me. \n[183]Because I'm your friend. \n[184]I am. Count on it.

Dad's gonna haul ass over this! \n[11]Just don't let go! \n[12]Everything gonna be okay! \n[13]Hang on. Brother! ", "RAY HANLEY": "\n[1]Hey, pal! \n[2]Well. At least she's an improvement. She doesn't crack gum in your face. That's what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing. \n[3]Hold, hold it. Wait a minute. That's not the problem. Where are you? \n[4]I've been losing you these days. \n[5]That's okay. That's okay. You off the track? \n[6]Come on. I've known you for twenty years. You think I can't tell when something's wrong? How's Connie? \n[7]Look, I am sorry, it's none of my business, but I think you worry too much. You've been on the rack about him long enough. You're making it a habit. You've gotta let him go sometime. \n[8]The thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go. Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year and not even go to school at all. Who knows? \n[9]I'm just try giving you the benefit of my experience. \n[10]With Valerie, it's more than her living away from home... She's gone. Got her own friends, her own life. She breezes in ...for a couple of days on vacations, but... I don't know, maybe girls are different. Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between Nance and me. But they leave... And all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap. It's just wasted energy. ", "WARD": "\n[1]Watch this. Pessimistic golfer. Pessimistic golfer. \n[2]Oh. Damn! \n[3]Are we two up? Two? \n[4]All right. Let's hustle up. We're close here. \n[5]I know it's flat, but we decided to teach you to love it. \n[6]'Cause you're in Texas, girl. When we get done, we'll get you home. Get ya some steaks on the barbecue. Audrey will put together her famous salad. \n[7]Oh !... \n[8]Drink, yes. Little, no. What'd you get? Cal, what'd you get? \n[9]Beth, listen. We all just want... Cal, Con, everybody, we just want you to be happy. \n[10]Yes. ", "Dr BERGER": "\n[1]Hello? \n[2]Hello? \n[3]Yes? \n[4]Who? \n[5]Oh, yes! I'm with a patient now. Can you call back at two fifteen? \n[6]Then give me your number. I'll call you tonite. Hello? Hello? \n[7]Ha! Hi! Come in. It's OK,     they all do that. \n[8]Hmm.... Jarrett. How long since you've been out of the hospital? \n[9]Feeling depressed? \n[10]On stage? \n[11]People nervous... treating you like you're ...a dangerous character? \n[12]Are you? \n[13]How long were you in the hospital? \n[14]What did you do? \n[15]It doesn't say what your method was. \n[16]Oh. So how does it feel being home? Everybody's glad to see you? \n[17]Friends? \n[18]\n[19]Everything... \n[20]You're back in school? Everything okay at school? Teachers? \n[21]No problems? \n[22]So why are you here? \n[23]Why? \n[24]Who's worried about you? \n[25]What about your mother? Isn't she worried about you, too? \n[26]Well, as long as you're straight. \n[27]Yes. He   called me on the phone. He told me   your name and... he told me to look   for you. And, uh... he said you had   a brother who died. A... boating   accident, wasn't it? Want to tell   me about it? Well I suppose you talked this over with Crawford at the hospital. Right? \n[28]How did that go? \n[29]Why do you want to change? \n[30]Why? \n[31]Well. I'll tell you something. I'll be straight with you, okay? I'm not big on control. But it's your money. \n[32]So to speak. Okay... \n[33]Well. Control's a tough nut. \n[34]Well. That's a problem. How do we solve that? \n[35]Well. It's up to you. \n[36]Mm-mmm. \n[37]I don't hold much stock in dreams. \n[38]Really? What's happening? What's going on? \n[39]What? \n[40]Look. Kiddo... I lied. I do believe in dreams. Only sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake. Come on, something's bugging you, making you nervous. You're making me nervous. \n[41]Tranquilizer? \n[42]I think you came in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers. It's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer. \n[43]Clock. \n[44]Mmm, mmm. \n[45]Right. \n[46]Ha, ha. \n[47]Ha, ha. \n[48]Ah, ah?... Have you ever thought about quitting? \n[49]No. \n[50]Forget about how it looks! How does it feel? \n[51]Yes! \n[52]Yes! How does it feel? \n[53]Are you the same person you were last year? \n[54]That's why you need a tranquilizer? \n[55]No. It's up to you! \n[56]Not necessarily. How is it with your friends? Is it getting any easier? \n[57]Is anyplace easy? \n[58]It was? Why? \n[59]Was there anyone there you could talk to? \n[60]I mean, besides Dr. Crawford? \n[61]What do you expect from her? \n[62]Why not? \n[63]What are you thinking? \n[64]So what else is new? Does it help? \n[65]What now? \n[66]Who? \n[67]Yeah. What about him? \n[68]So much as what? \n[69]What would John Boy have said? \n[70]Come on. Come on. \n[71]Don't hold back. \n[72]So, what did your dad say about it? \n[73]How come? \n[74]Can you tell your mother? \n[75]No. Sorry's out. Come on, something's on your mind. \n[76]No, no, never mind the time. There's time. Look. Remember the contract? Control? Maybe there's some connection between control and uh... \u00ad what do we call it? - lack of feeling? Mmm? \n[77]When? \n[78]When? \n[79]Come on, come on, Jarrett, I thought you didn't like to fool around. \n[80]Like to play games, do you? \n[81]So? \n[82]I'll tell you what I want. I want you to leave \"I don't know\" out there on the table with the magazines. Okay? \n[83]Yeah. That would be nice. Make one up. Right now. About how there's no feelings in there. \n[84]Oh! Now you have, now you don't! Get it together, Jarrett. \n[85]Are you mad? \n[86]Oh, cut the shit! You're mad! You're mad as hell! You don't like being pushed. So why don't you do something about it! \n[87]Tell me to fuck off! I don't know. \n[88]Why not? \n[89]Why not? \n[90]Do you know how much energy it takes to hold it back? \n[91]Oh! I beg your pardon! I never promised you a rose garden... \n[92]What? \n[93]Yeah? \n[94]That's it! \n[95]What do you think? \n[96]Sounds good to me. \n[97]A little advice about feeling, kiddo... Don't expect it always to tickle. \n[98]Tuesday you felt great. You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay? \n[99]Don't take refuge in one-liners like \"You're the doctor\". Okay? Because that pisses me off. \n[100]So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy. \n[101]What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit? \n[102]Come on. You must be able to come up with at least one example. And don't give me \"I tried to kill myself\", that's old turkey. What have you done lately? \n[103]Uh, uh. \n[104]What? \n[105]What? \n[106]Well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution. \n[107]Doesn't make it any less true. \n[108]Yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself. \n[109]Recognize her limitations. \n[110]Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love you enough. Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able. \n[111]Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that? \n[112]Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels. \n[113]I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive. \n[114]Why don't you give yourself a break? Let yourself off the hook? \n[115]We'll talk about it on Thursday. \n[116]Time's up. \n[117]Come on, Con. You know the rules. \n[118]You think about it. Just think about it. \n[119]That's good. \n[120]Okay. \n[121]Neither do I. \n[122]Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that? \n[123]But you still feel responsible? \n[124]You think of yourself as a lucky man, then? \n[125]That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney. \n[126]What would you want to do about that? \n[127]And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence? \n[128]For what? \n[129]Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck? \n[130]And you? \n[131]What I mean is, your wife's affection. \n[132]Yes. \n[133]Mm-hmm.   Very private. \n[134]Okay. Why don't we? \n[135]Hello? \n[136]What's going on? \n[137]What time is it? \n[138]Where are you? \n[139]All right. Listen to me. Get to the office somehow, and I'll meet you there. \n[140]Oh, good. You're here. \n[141]Just wait, just hold on... \n[142]Just wait till we get inside... \n[143]There... \n[144]Shit. You'd think they'd assume there'd be an emergency now and then?! \n[145]Don't take it off. Just sit down. \n[146]What? \n[147]It's what? \n[148]What do you need? Tell me! \n[149]Don't try. \n[150]For what? \n[151]What did you do? \n[152]What did you do? \n[153]Point? What point? It happened! \n[154]I know that, it wasn't your fault. \n[155]And that wasn't fair, was it? \n[156]Because I got tired! \n[157]It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it? \n[158]Bad things happen even when people are careful. \n[159]OK, so you made a mistake. \n[160]Maybe you were stronger. Did it ever occur to you that you might have been stronger? \n[161]How long you gonna punish yourself? When you gonna quit? \n[162]Why don't you? \n[163]I know. \n[164]What happened? You said something happened. What started all this? \n[165]Jesus. \n[166]No. She wasn't. \n[167]What? \n[168]And what? \n[169]What? \n[170]You saw her once and now you' want to take her on too? \n[171]No? \n[172]What? \n[173]Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it too. \n[174]You're right. It isn't fair. \n[175]Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing you did? \n[176]You know. \n[177]You know. \n[178]Exactly. \n[179]Now. You can live with that. Can't you? \n[180]Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying? \n[181]You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that. \n[182]It is good. Believe me. \n[183]Because I'm your friend. \n[184]I am. Count on it.
