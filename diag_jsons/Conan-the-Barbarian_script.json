{"dialogues": {"CONAN": "\n[1]The boy's eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea. \n[2]They killed one. I killed three. I am a warrior now. 6. \n[3]They would have done the same -- \n[4]\"Stoke your fire, chop your wood.\" I have slept where wolves dare not. I have balanced a thousand river stones. When will you teach me the sword? 7. \n[5]To slay ones enemies. \n[6]Why did it break? 8. \n[7]Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and reaches the far end of the village. Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are helping the Spearmen slay the wounded. Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the \n[8]Father! \n[9]Do we need more weapons? \n[10]No! I will fight! \n[11]Father, I am not afraid to die. \n[12]No! \n[13]The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last saw. Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller City Guards, who instinctively take a step back. \n[14]No, my small friends. It's time to die. Now-- \n[15]Who's first -- \n[16]Where's the Captain of the Guard? \n[17]In truth, I've been guilty of much. Jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink. But through that I've searched and waited and hunted my prey. \n[18]But drink? Haven't had a drop all night. \n[19]The key to the cells. 22. \n[20]I came for you, Lucius. \n[21]I do. And I am no ape. I am Cimmerian. \n[22]I'm the one who made you pretty. \n[23]No. I am death. And I came a long way for you. \n[24]Where? \n[25]Who are you offering? \n[26]You have my word. You tell me where I will find Khalar Singh, and I will not kill you. \n[27]Toasting, to our deal. \n[28]Go. You are free. \n[29]The key to your shackles sits in the Captain's gut. Happy hunting. \n[30]No. I said I wouldn't kill you. \n[31]Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons. \n[32]Khor Kalba. Which way? \n[33]Use your whips on the horses' legs! \n[34]Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan launches himself down at the horsemen below. WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He cuts them down where they sit. The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team, trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's decapitated. Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the wagon. \n[35]You! \n[36]Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very fast. Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way. The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off, speaking in the broken language of a savage. \n[37]Who are you? \n[38]Many died to capture nobody.  Get up. \n[39]Perhaps the slavers took your orders. I don't. 40. \n[40]You speak of animals as if they were less than men. But animals don't stab their brothers in the back or steal their mother's only possession. And they never lie. \n[41]Very well. Give me your name. \n[42]I am Conan. \n[43]What more names do I need? \n[44]There is only one truth I need from you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why does Khalar Singh want you? \n[45]Then let's hope it's for your cooking. \n[46]Trying to poison me? \n[47]What are you doing? \n[48]Crom! What would you pray for? That a bone may not get stuck in your throat? No words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you. \n[49]I need no pity. \n[50]Don't worry. His back is broken. He won't be slinking away this time. \n[51]Now, let's eat. \n[52]I enjoy a little music with my meal. \n[53]You are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it. Your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are. \n[54]Why would he? \n[55]One what? \n[56]A queen in hiding. \n[57]So I should ransom her to your master? Not exactly loyal -- but still, a good idea. \n[58]You'll help me deliver it. \n[59]Good. Die. \n[60]Here. Eat. \n[61]Fire draws attention. \n[62]The only blood on these hands I claimed with my own sword. \n[63]Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and Queens claim more lives than I will ever meet, and not a drop is spilled in their presence. \n[64]You lie. You are the very reason my people are dead. \n[65]But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed my people, looking for you. 48. \n[66]You know this. \n[67]You hid from him. And while you did, others died in your place. \n[68]And I do not care, for he will not live to see it bear fruit! \n[69]Enough lies. \n[70]You will keep quiet. 49. \n[71]You will be the lure that will draw me close. Then I will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands. \n[72]They will not be a problem. \n[73]Did I ask? \n[74]I will not fail. \n[75]Be still! \n[76]I have what you want! Where's my gold?! \n[77]Send the gold. 51. \n[78]I was wondering what it would take for you to stop cowering. \n[79]It's not enough. I've failed you father. \n[80]I don't understand -- \n[81]Where am I? \n[82]You were -- adequate. \n[83]I was just wondering what that smell was.  Now I know. \n[84]If it's metal you seek, perhaps you'd settle for steel. 58. \n[85]Still fast Artus. \n[86]It won't get easier. Khalar Singh lives. He'll be coming for me and the girl. \n[87]This one may be more than you wish. I need you to get me close to Khor Kalba. \n[88]I do. 59. \n[89]Just leave me to sleep. \n[90]You would risk your life for royalty? Why? \n[91]A tall tale. Meant to scare children. \n[92]What care I for queens and empires? 60. \n[93]I heard. Only I would happily put all of your \"civilization\" to the torch myself. \n[94]My only debt is to my people. And it still lies unpaid. \n[95]I hope I awoke with less clamor. \n[96]Is there a better reason to drink? \n[97]You've never tasted mead? \n[98]I have no future. It died with my people, as I should have. \n[99]Nothing. \n[100]I believe in the cold of steel, the warmth of flesh. All else is fairy tales. 66. \n[101]Purpose. I die with purpose. \n[102]That is what they wish. They drive us to another force, approaching from the south. \n[103]No. We give them what they think they want.  About ship! Now! \n[104]Let us show them why she is called the Wasp. \n[105]Fire! \n[106]Rip her apart! \n[107]Fire! \n[108]Good. I was growing weary with boredom. \n[109]Hide her below. \n[110]Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the side. \n[111]The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart. The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles. \n[112]Time to go. 72. \n[113]I need you head west, to draw off our pursuers. I'll find another path to Khor Kalba. \n[114]I never said that. But I won't leave a virgin onboard a pirate ship, alone. \n[115]We'll rest here until morning. 73. \n[116]I would do you a kindness. Khor Kalba will bring only death. \n[117]We leave at dawn. I will not break stride for you. Not once. I will get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond that I have my purpose, and you yours. \n[118]Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log, throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm. The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as he mercifully SNAPS its neck. \n[119]They fought beside the men. \n[120]She died in battle, even as I was born. \n[121]I don't lie. \n[122]Do you ever tire of talking? Let me rest, woman. \n[123]We'll slip in, along with those traders. But you'll need a change of clothes, those monks' robes will draw attention. \n[124]And what better disguise for a monk? 78. \n[125]Do not test me, beast. \n[126]It's probably only way into Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night. \n[127]And dodge arrows as we do so? \n[128]During the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. And it would be useless to even attempt at night. No, we must find another way. \n[129]Thieves. You'll regret finding me. \n[130]What? Do you wish to join in? \n[131]So that's it? \n[132]What is it? \n[133]Not from me. \n[134]Around. Up. \n[135]82. \n[136]What? \n[137]Crom! Stop wasting time. \n[138]Crom indeed. 83. \n[139]Let's go. \n[140]Nothing good. \n[141]Stay behind me. \n[142]Who dies first? \n[143]Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo. Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much like the one Conan cut through earlier. \n[144]Crom! \n[145]Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her, evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety planks. \n[146]Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to another. Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian, forcing him to defend while still not balanced. \n[147]Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move, he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold onto Tamara. \n[148]With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at the edge of the pit. But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun entering the arena. \n[149]You're going to fight Khalar's troops? Just you? \n[150]You want my help again. \n[151]Let me ask. \n[152]Will be where your queen is. \n[153]A swift end! \n[154]You lie. I was there. My father never uttered a sound. \n[155]I saw my father die. Slain by one who can only kill men already on their knees. \n[156]Really? Then why did your father not let you face me before, when I had sword in hand. He thought you unequal to the task. \n[157]Coward! Prove your strength! \n[158]Take my eyes, coward -- if you can. 92. \n[159]Crom. \n[160]Me! \n[161]Let her go. \n[162]My purpose. \n[163]Once you used my father to teach your son a lesson about strength. Now let me teach you. \n[164]On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly, trying to get to Tamara. \n[165]Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining Guardsmen. \n[166]His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling the cliffs of Cimmeria. \n[167]Your story ends here. \n[168]Like a woman, Fariq cried and begged me to spare him. \n[169]Tamara!! \n[170]No. \n[171]I cannot. 103. ", "TAMARA": "\n[1]Stop it! I'm trying to pray! \n[2]Then hit yourself. \n[3]Of course she can. She even taught it to me. \"Never again.\" \n[4]Never again will we stand by as darkness consumes the world. Never again will innocents suffer for others' power. Never again will the Queen suffer so Acheron may rise. 29. \n[5]If you are caught, everything we live for is lost! 30. \n[6]Good to know. \n[7]Run! \n[8]We'll die if we stay! \n[9]\n[10]Water -- please -- \n[11]She awakens to the SCREAMING of a whipped SLAVE GIRL. \n[12]Let me go. I promise you'll be rewarded. \n[13]Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her, his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches out and breaks the lock on her chains. \n[14]I am nobody. \n[15]And if I don't wish to ride with you? \n[16]Stop! I want water. \n[17]I never knew men could be so cruel. Now I wonder if the world is filled with animals such as you. \n[18]I haven't lied. \n[19]I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And you? \n[20]Conan? That's it? \n[21]Before we eat, I must pray. \n[22]Then you have no faith. And I am sorry for you. \n[23]But you do. You live in a world that is harsh and short. Where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke. I live in a world with a purpose that guides me, where faith sustains me. \n[24]Why did you-- 42. \n[25]But -- what about him?! \n[26]She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far, muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and carries her back to the outcropping. He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at her feet. \n[27]Couldn't you at least cook it first? \n[28]Does it bother you, blood on your hands? \n[29]What does that mean? \n[30]What are you talking about? I've done no harm to you. I've done no harm to anyone. \n[31]Are you mad? I never met your people. \n[32]The one who came for us? His name is Khalar Singh? \n[33]We did not know who sought us, only that we were sought. \n[34]If we did not hide, countless more would have been killed! You do not know what purpose he has for our queen. \n[35]Wait -- you seek to kill this Khalar? We have the same aim. He takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I have sworn an oath to protect her. I can help you. \n[36]What use is talking? You won't believe a word I speak. I only want to know this -- how will you kill Khalar? You are too big to play the assassin. \n[37]And the archers and cavalry? They will be napping? \n[38]No. Not good enough. \n[39]Should you fail, I'll be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands. Let me help, Conan. \n[40]I wouldn't move so fast. I bound your wounds as best I could, but I'm no healer. 57. \n[41]On the Wasp. You told me where it laid, just before you passed out. Though I can't say as I feel much safer here. \n[42]Don't embarrass me with thanks, I only saved your life. \n[43]We go to Khor Kalba? \n[44]No. We do. \n[45]Because she represent freedom, not just ours but all Hyboria's. What do you know of Acheron? \n[46]It is no fable. It's my people's history. Acheron was an empire that swallowed all of Hyboria, led by the King and his legion of demon warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable. Immortal. But still it had one weakness. For the true power of Acheron laid not with its King, but the Queen. Every twenty years, a new queen from the royal line would be coronated with a crown of iron. Spikes would pierce her, slowly drain her precious blood, and through her suffering Acheron would remain invincible. Until one of my ancestors, an Acheronian himself, put a stop to this tyranny. He and others spirited the new Queen away, hiding her from the empire and all those who would raise it again. \n[47]Didn't you hear me? This evil faces us all. All of civilization will fall if the army of Acheron is raised again. \n[48]But -- you owe me a debt, you thankless oaf! \n[49]You've known Conan long? \n[50]He is a riddle to me. \n[51]We have the same goal. Why will he not trust me? \n[52]That is no way to live. 62. \n[53]And yet you call him friend, and risk death to help him. \n[54]He's a stubborn ass. \n[55]No!!! \n[56]You're drinking? You were near death this time yesterday. 65. \n[57]Do you think--I could try some of that? I'm curious of its taste. \n[58]It's good. \n[59]Let me ask you something. Once you've killed Khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? You will be free from your ghosts. What of your future, Conan? \n[60]So your life is penance? For what, for living? And when you too die, what do you believe happens then? \n[61]Nothing? I couldn't live without some kind of belief in the world after this. \n[62]Perhaps. But I still die with faith in my heart, belief in something greater than one's self. What will you die with? \n[63]Why is she called the Wasp? \n[64]She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly reaches in and grabs her. As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He doesn't even flinch. \n[65]So you are taking me with you to Khor Kalba. \n[66]I -- but -- who said I was a virgin? \n[67]Will I awake alone? Do you intend to leave me? \n[68]Please, Conan. Artus told me of how you lost your tribe. I too had to watch as my people were taken from me. \n[69]All I ask is that you let me travel with you. I too have a purpose. I must get to the queen. I would rather you kill me here, than fail her again. \n[70]I was wrong about you. You are no fearless warrior. Your heart is closed to all but fear -- and hate. \n[71]Nice fire. Does it mean you'll actually cook the meat this time? \n[72]What were the women of your tribe like, Conan? \n[73]So they were equals. And your mother? \n[74]So you never knew her. It was the same with me. I've always known being a mother was somehow not my fate. But-- \n[75]You said earlier Khor Kalba will bring only death. Were you trying to scare me, or do you really believe our end lies there? \n[76]Then we don't have much time. Your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared. \n[77]So -- do you care, Conan? 76. \n[78]I've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, Conan. What would you live for? \n[79]I thought that may work. \n[80]I see you clearly now, finally, after all this time.  I would be that which you live for, Conan, if you would have me. You may have faith in nothing, Conan -- but I have faith in you. \n[81]What will I wear? \n[82]Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan, miserable. \n[83]I don't understand why I couldn't be dressed as you are. I look like a whore. \n[84]Is there not a living thing you can be at peace with? \n[85]So we must try to scale the cliff. \n[86]Catacombs? You mean sewers. \n[87]A warning. These catacombs are connected to the sea. It says that the beasts of Acheron protect its secrets. \n[88]Where now? \n[89]Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within. \n[90]Oh!!! \n[91]Something touched me. Something slimy. \n[92]What is that? \n[93]Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks. \n[94]She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing towards her from either side. \n[95]She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS \n[96]The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES \n[97]She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and Conan aloft. \n[98]Where is Ilira? \n[99]Then I'm too late. \n[100]Cimmerians aren't the only women who know how to fight. And to kill. \n[101]Our duty was to keep the queen safe. We failed. But if Khalar brings her to Acheron, it will rise again -- and all our peoples' sacrifice is for nothing. 88. \n[102]So if the queen is not free by the stroke of midnight -- she must be already dead. \n[103]No. You kept your word, I'll keep mine. I pray you fulfill your debt. \n[104]Don't kill him. We need to find out which way Ilira was taken. \n[105]Tell us where the last girl was taken. \n[106]Your debt -- 89. \n[107]Ilira! \n[108]She's dead. It's over. \n[109]No. It can't be -- \n[110]No! \n[111]This is no empire, only a graveyard. \n[112]Stop. You don't know what you are about to do. \n[113]He'll--be---here--sooner. \n[114]Conan!!! \n[115]Conan!!! 102. \n[116]Conan! \n[117]Conan, you know what you must do. Kill me. \n[118]It is the only way to end this. My death gives others life. \n[119]You must. Your parents both understood that purpose. Now it is yours. Live, Conan. \n[120]Live, Conan. Live. ", "KHALAR SINGH": "\n[1]This lowly tribe of barbarians have buried every warrior ever to set foot on this land, Lucius. \n[2]Then show us. But should you fail, remember the plan. \n[3]I said I wanted a word with him. \n[4]As promised. \n[5]All you wish, once we are gone. 15. \n[6]I take no pleasure in this day, barbarian. Your people are fierce warriors, deserving of every story told of them. But now you must choose the story for yourself. I am Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked from the best Hyboria. My second, Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo and his Shadow Scouts from the jungles of Zingara. And countless others. They all had a day like this one. They all chose a way forward. \n[7]I seek neither gold nor steel, but flesh and blood. The last of a royal line that goes back three thousand years. \n[8]But I seek a woman. \n[9]A queen in hiding. Point her out and you'll spare the lives of your own. Perhaps even your wife? \n[10]Then our stories began in the same place, Cimmerian. I too lost my wife to marauders. How many men, in how many lands have suffered so? The only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown. That is the legacy I seek. Will you join me? \n[11]Very well. Then death will be your story. Your men will die. And your women too, when I am done with them. None will survive to carry your name forth, and over time, even your enemies will forget you ever were. You will be wiped from the pages of history.  Take your blood, but leave the kill. \n[12]Fariq! Come! \n[13]Before you lies our enemy. His tribe waits for him in the beyond. What would you do? 17. \n[14]Show me your strength, Fariq. Without it, you will never rule. With it, you will never be forgotten. \n[15]You have your desire. Death has found you. \n[16]Burn this place. It no longer exists. \n[17]He says the Queen is here. \n[18]Take care, Ukafa. You hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not. \n[19]And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen. And in that respect, Fariq has my confidence. He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone. \n[20]Who was guarding that gate? \n[21]Take four legions. Hunt her. Before I hunt you. \n[22]All these years searching the ends of the earth. And here you are. Just a two day ride from Khor Kalba. I can scarcely believe it. \n[23]Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't know who we are. Maybe he's not looking for the Queen. \n[24]That's right, my brethren, you have been lied to all your lives. Told you must hide yourselves, told you were alone. I want you to look at me, and see me for what I am. A brother. A friend. I have come not to hurt you, but liberate you. \n[25]Yes. I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has ever known. \n[26]Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. Acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory. 34. \n[27]And in place of that glory, you offer shame? I knew shame, but that was before I was shown my true lineage. \n[28]When I was but a child, raiders destroyed my village, cut our fathers to ribbons, and burned our women as sacrifice to foreign gods. Those few who survived, we ran for our lives, chased into caves at the edge of the Eastern Sea, left with nothing to live for. But then we discovered it. Acheron. The temple that spawned an empire. We learned that we were not broken goat- herders on a desolate coastline. We were the sons and daughters of kings.  And queens. \n[29]For thirty years I have searched for you. In that time I built both an army and empire, but they are nothing compared to what we can create together. We can raise Acheron again. Never again will we hide like rats. Never again will we watch as our loved ones are slaughtered. I call forth the Queen. Stand and join me, and this day will have a joyous end. \n[30]Yes. You will. 35. \n[31]He brought a message? \n[32]Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for me to deliver in person. \n[33]Enough! We will take no chances. We will pay this thief what he wants, and more. \n[34]He killed Remo, likely his cavalry legion as well. Whatever he is, he is more than a mere thief. \n[35]Triple your price. Come and claim it. \n[36]Send her to me. \n[37]You're fast. But are you fast enough? \n[38]Fariq! \n[39]I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian. \n[40]Cimmerian it is. Now it makes sense. You came for blood, not gold. 53. \n[41]Your people barely afforded me a challenge. You're little more than beasts. \n[42]You've come a long way, barbarian, only to fail. \n[43]So much for vengeance.  Get me oil -- and a torch. \n[44]Is that really the best you could do? Is that as far as you could think ahead? Just rush in and kill me? 54. \n[45]The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire. He grits his teeth and climbs the wall. \n[46]Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South. \n[47]You will return to Khor Kalba. You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen. \n[48]You think I care what you wish?! You want to play warrior? It is not in you. One day you will be king, but warlord, never. \n[49]You will not risk your life again. You are my line, my successor. You will not throw away all that I have worked for. \n[50]If I find you smiling before you bring me the girl, I will take every tooth I see. \n[51]Which way did they sail? \n[52]Are you certain? \n[53]Send word to Ukafa. They come to him by sea. \n[54]Find me a warship. \n[55]Fariq has done well.  Head east, back to Khor Kalba. \n[56]The chase is over. They come to me now. \n[57]It's only begun. Because that one was not the heir to Acheron. \n[58]She is. \n[59]Secretive, the traitors of Acheron. It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. That poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself. 90. \n[60]And you did the rest, barbarian. My thanks for delivering the Queen to me. \n[61]You see only with your eyes. \n[62]Close the gates and stay here. Send my son to me when he arrives.  You two, come with me. \n[63]The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall. 94. \n[64]For a hundred generations the kings of Acheron were crowned, and the queens were sacrificed. \n[65]What a day for you. This morning you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you are a queen giving birth to an empire. \n[66]But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes. \n[67]It begins. You give birth to an empire. \n[68]It's good that you pray. Gods will be here soon. \n[69]Who? \n[70]I will say this for you, barbarian. You are hard to kill. \n[71]You've faced me before and lost. What do you think has changed now? \n[72]You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal. \n[73]No. \n[74]Cimmerian!!! 98. \n[75]The Queen. Shackle her! \n[76]Beyond my dreams -- \n[77]Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects, clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying mantis. \n[78]I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron. I command you to kneel! \n[79]Show him the might of the army of Acheron! \n[80]Fine. Take your fill. I will kill him myself. \n[81]They take her to a place you can never follow. Who will you fail, Cimmerian? Your father or your woman? ", "CORIN": "\n[1]Islene!!! \n[2]I cannot. \n[3]Do not speak, love. \n[4]Conan? Conan?! \n[5]What have you done, boy? \n[6]A warrior? What you have done a jackal would do. Never a warrior. \n[7]As I said, jackals. He is not ready. I will forge him myself. \n[8]Stoke your fire, boy. \n[9]Think you're ready? Then tell me: what is a sword's purpose? \n[10]No. That is what it does. Its purpose is why you use it. \n[11]Tell me, which makes the best sword? \n[12]The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall make a sword of it, and tomorrow you will show me what brute strength yields. \n[13]Because it had no life. \n[14]The softer ore is what a man lives for. It is flexible and lasting. It survives, even against the greatest of foes. But too much of the soft ore, the blade will not cut deep enough when it must. \n[15]A sword must be tempered, the two ores united through fire and ice. Through its suffering the sword comes to hold both life and death. \n[16]Now tell me, what is this sword's purpose? \n[17]This one is not ready yet. 9. \n[18]Conan? 11. \n[19]Wait! Hold your ground! \n[20]Come. \n[21]Go. There is a hunting lodge in the North Pass with provisions. \n[22]This fight is over, but yours has just begun. You wanted to be a warrior of the tribe, Conan--now you must be its last. \n[23]Good. Make your death have purpose. \n[24]What is it you want? \n[25]Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each man is free here. \n[26]My wife was killed, long ago, by swine such as you. 16. \n[27]Soon -- it comes for you. \n[28]More wood boy! We must test the steel with our fire. \n[29]What are you waiting for? The fire is dying. \n[30]It will never be enough, Conan. \n[31]Through suffering, you will learn your purpose, boy. And you have not begun to suffer yet. ", "FARIQ": "\n[1]I would cut out his eyes, father, so that he will not find them. So he will wander the afterlife forever. \n[2]Father, they are here! The hidden oasis, just as it was written. \n[3]The caves beneath Khor Khalba contain all manner of creature, many -- altered -- by centuries of blood magic. But one, in particular, has developed a special connection to the blood. A thirst. It is said that only the Queen of Acheron itself can resist its embrace. \n[4]So what say you? Will you be the lucky one, or will you tell me who is? \n[5]You let the girl escape once, Ukafa. What makes you think you can do better now? \n[6]I found the monastery. It was my understanding that you were in charge of its capture -- \n[7]Let me take care of this thief, father. He's beneath your notice. 50. \n[8]Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way. \n[9]You should have run, while you could. \n[10]What of me, father? 55. \n[11]I will not. I will track the barbarian with you -- \n[12]I can. Let me prove it to you! \n[13]Here we stand again. Will the queen reveal herself, or must another innocent suffer? \n[14]My father, he tires of your charade. He grows impatient. But I have no such haste. I enjoy watching you squirm. 63. \n[15]Perhaps you'd like to see the end your sisters faced back at the monastery? \n[16]No? Your fear is not enough yet? Let's try harder. \n[17]I've read all there is to know of mighty Acheron. Why would true Acheronians protect a traitor to their own? You once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice. \n[18]And mice are meant to be swallowed whole. \n[19]What was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. But the beast of Acheron, it will claim four of you this night. 64. \n[20]Who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen? \n[21]At last. Some bravery. But of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you? \n[22]At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's been hours you've made me wait for my fun. \n[23]You made me lose face in front of my father. That wasn't wise. But what should I expect from a Cimmerian? \n[24]Hardly. But that is a difference between you and me. A swift end would be a mercy I do not intend to grant. No, you must suffer for your transgressions. 91. \n[25]You must beg for your suffering to end. Just as your people did. \n[26]You were there? What were you doing, warrior? Watching your father die, without saying a sound? Taking your eyes will be justice indeed, coward. \n[27]I've killed many in battle, cur. \n[28]Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS. Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD ", "ARTUS": "\n[1]Look what we have here. A hill ape in over his head. \n[2]We take no stowaways. Only paying passengers. You've best be laden with gold. \n[3]Fast, deadly, charming, rakishly handsome.  All hail Conan! \n[4]Sorry, friend. Looks like you've had a rough road. \n[5]Good. We're scrapping for a fight these days. \n[6]Rest up. We'll get you there. \n[7]Try not to taste it going down would be my advice. \n[8]We sailed with him for a while. I would like to say I know the man. \n[9]Aye, he's that too. \n[10]Why would he? He's a stranger in every land he trods. A man with no home, no people, none but the company of ghosts. And he bears the weight of their deaths every moment of every day. \n[11]He doesn't live. I've seen in him great mirth, only to watch it smothered by greater melancholy. He owes a blood debt, and he can entertain no other joy, no other cause, until it is fulfilled. \n[12]Let me tell you something of Conan. He will never lie. He will never break a trust, once given. And he will never, ever give up. \n[13]He is that, lass. He is that. \n[14]What do you think? They have us outnumbered, but we might beat their speed. 67. \n[15]Then we fight? \n[16]And now? \n[17]Open astern! Load the stinger! 68. \n[18]Bring her back! \n[19]She's dead in the water! \n[20]The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a handspike. \n[21]I could get you closer. Another half day along the coast -- \n[22]So be it. Swift wind at your backs. ", "LUCIUS": "\n[1]All this sneaking around for a lowly tribe of barbarians. \n[2]That is only because they have never faced my legion. \n[3]Retreat! \n[4]Indeed. I savor it. 12. \n[5]Men! 23. \n[6]You've made a huge mistake, ape. You'll never make it out of this place. \n[7]You talk as though you know me, ape. \n[8]What do you want? Who are you? \n[9]Impossible! You're dead! \n[10]Wait!! Wait!! I can tell you where the rest are. \n[11]The end of the earth. You kill me, and you'll never find them. 25. \n[12]Who do you think? All of them. Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and Khalar Singh himself. But you have to swear you won't kill me. \n[13]He is in a city called on the edge of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of Hyboria.

He knows nothing of leading an army -- \n[4]My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am simply concerned for your army. 27. \n[5]I'll find them -- and come back with their heads. \n[6]I did what? \n[7]Good. We only need stay close. \n[8]No. Let them fire again! \n[9]So be it.  Get below. Be ready. \n[10]Now! \n[11]Find the girl! \n[12]The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another pirate. \n[13]We are each the last of our tribe, Cimmerian.

Khalar needs them alive. \n[2]The north gate. Destroy it. 31. \n[3]It was I, Lord. 32. \n[4]The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins, stopping the wagon. Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes. \n[5]The girl! Bring her to Khalar! \n[6]Please! Mercy! \n[7]Stop! Stop! I know how make you rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar Singh? You have what he want. The girl, yes? Khalar give you anything for her. More! \n[8]She could be the one. \n[9]The one. The Queen. \n[10]Yes! Yes! I sent to find her.

After all that work, I figured I'd keep it -- for old times' sake. \n[2]--so you were right about the platform. You'll be long dead before you make it top. Same with scaling the cliff. There's no known way to break into the fortress. \n[3]I didn't say that. I just said there's no known way in -- because no one has ever tried to. But breaking out -- that's another story. It's not much easier, but it's possible. \n[4]You just need to find someone crazy enough to show you the way. \n[5]These catacombs run underneath the entire city, even to the cistern that drains out from the fortress dungeon. \n[6]Piss and shit are the last things you need to worry about down here. 81. \n[7]Sorry, friend.
