{"dialogues": {"ROBIN": "\n[1]No!... I took the bread. \n[2]They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. \n[3]And this is English courage. \n[4]You speak English? \n[5]What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook. \n[6]Hmm!   Not bad. \n[7]Why should we trust you? \n[8]He makes a point. \n[9]A good point. \n[10]Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here. \n[11]Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast. \n[12]Amen, brother. \n[13]God willing, we may now be safe. \n[14]Come, Peter.    We must hurry. \n[15]Hold on to my shoulder. \n[16]I swear it. \n[17]Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way. \n[18]I go to England. \n[19]England?   Why? \n[20]Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation. \n[21]And if I don't want you? \n[22]Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan? \n[23]Home.    Thank you, Lord. \n[24]My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land... \n[25]I thought you'd say that. \n[26]Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father. \n[27]Why must you walk in back of me? \n[28]Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point. \n[29]For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family. \n[30]You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? \n[31]So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman? \n[32]By the Lord, that's it! \n[33]They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so? \n[34]Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right? \n[35]Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it! \n[36]You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name? \n[37]Her name? \n[38]Her name? \n[39]Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful? \n[40]That way. \n[41]I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it? \n[42]Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. \n[43]Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal. \n[44]Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me. \n[45]The man who strikes that tree dies. \n[46]Perhaps we could discuss this. \n[47]Aslan!   It's time to redeem that vow. \n[48]Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered. \n[49]I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all. \n[50]Aslan!! \n[51]On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray. \n[52]Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people. \n[53]You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered. \n[54]Which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time I'm outnumbered six to one!! \n[55]Barely. \n[56]After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands. \n[57]Have no fear, boy. \n[58]Ha!   It was you he was scared of. \n[59]Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds. \n[60]With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace. \n[61]Father!    Hello! \n[62]Noooooo! \n[63]I should have been here. \n[64]Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down? \n[65]You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows. \n[66]What has happened? \n[67]Did they have witnesses? \n[68]Did you believe the charges? \n[69]Who did this to you, Duncan? \n[70]Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right. Please forgive me, Father. \n[71]I failed him. I should have been here at his side. \n[72]Leave me. \n[73]Leave me. \n[74]I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name. ... Or until I am dead. \n[75]We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool. \n[76]This is summer. \n[77]Why, pray? \n[78]You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends. \n[79]Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together. \n[80]Open up! \n[81]Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door. \n[82]Aagh! \n[83]Is the child Marian at home? \n[84]I am Robin of Locksley. \n[85]I may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. But for now I am real enough. \n[86]By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are you? \n[87]Then show yourself, child.     For we knew each other well. \n[88]You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you. \n[89]Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed. \n[90]Er... the years have been kind. \n[91]Wait, Marian!    ...ouch! \n[92]You are truly courageous against an unarmed man. \n[93]Marian. \n[94]We were together five terrible years in a Saracen prison. \n[95]Marian, I'm sorry. \n[96]On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands. \n[97]Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there. \n[98]The you must allow me to be your guardian. \n[99]Marian, I don't want to replace him. \n[100]I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger. \n[101]I'm not leaving. \n[102]Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? \n[103]He can ride. \n[104]Damn you, animal! \n[105]Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. \n[106]I know!   I know! \n[107]Easy, easy. \n[108]I love you! \n[109]What is your pleasure, Gisborne? \n[110]You survived one meeting.    Our next will be your last. \n[111]That's a lie! \n[112]We have lost them. I'll lame this mare if I ask her to go any farther. \n[113]Is this Arab magic? \n[114]God knows! \n[115]We can lose them in the forest. \n[116]Either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves. \n[117]They're not following. \n[118]Be quiet!    Listen. \n[119]Behind you! \n[120]No, there!    And there! \n[121]Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. \n[122]Aslan! \n[123]I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man? \n[124]Er... Robin... \n[125]...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are you? \n[126]Bestman?   You lead this rabble? \n[127]Tax?   For what? \n[128]I will pay no tax. Besides, I have nothing but my cloak and my sword. \n[129]That is sacred to me. \n[130]You will have to fight me for it. \n[131]This man is your father? Tell him how I saved your hide from the Sheriff's soldiers. That deserves some gratitude, I believe. \n[132]Aslan! \n[133]Son of an Arab whore! Once again your assistance was invaluable. \n[134]That rabble? \n[135]They have a leader.   A very large one. \n[136]Allah has taken your brains. \n[137]You, too? You expect me to fight that behemoth? \n[138]This is my bridge. No one crosses without paying tax. \n[139]If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion. \n[140]You don't have the courage to face me again, John Little? Or should I call you 'Little John'? \n[141]Do you yield? \n[142]Do you yield? \n[143]Good.   Now put your feet down. \n[144]Pay me the tax. \n[145]A fine brew, Little John. \n[146]You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am glad I chanced by in time to help. \n[147]Tell me about your men, John. \n[148]How do you come by the name, Bull? \n[149]Because you are short? \n[150]No, Bull.    Save it for the ladies. \n[151]Your name, friend? \n[152]Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I'd be glad to have you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me. \n[153]How is it there are so many of you in hiding? \n[154]How do you fare? \n[155]While the Sheriff steals your land and your families starve? \n[156]Your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so long, my friend. Soon the Sheriff will hunt you down and hang you. You must fight back. \n[157]We must organize. Win by guile. \n[158]No.   To lead you. \n[159]There are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror. \n[160]What is your name, friend? \n[161]He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw. \n[162]We can win.   And I believe we will. \n[163]English dogs.    They can learn. \n[164]Too much mead, old friend.    What day is it? \n[165]Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass? \n[166]Then I must ask you a favor. \n[167]Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm always falling down. \n[168]Alms for a blind man. For one who cannot see your beauty. \n[169]So you care for my safety? \n[170]Under the Sheriff's law, that's a badge of pride. \n[171]How much? \n[172]Is that all? I have not annoyed him enough. Soon he will offer ten thousand. \n[173]How do you know? \n[174]What is he planning? \n[175]If you need me, I will be with the woodsmen. Send for me as 'Robin Hood.' \n[176]What? \n[177]Care to join me? \n[178]A hundred crowns, Sheriff?   You insult me. \n[179]Remember young Robin of Locksley, Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your nemesis. Your avenging angel. \n[180]If I kill you, I will hang happy. \n[181]I want to give you a chance. A chance you do not deserve. A chance to right your wrongs. \n[182]From this day forward you will cease to tax my people. You will renounce the charges against my father, and you will return his lands to me. \n[183]Because for every harm you do, I swear by God I shall visit on you threefold in return. \n[184]I am here with a blade at your throat. As long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again. \n[185]Your answer? \n[186]Then it will begin.. \n[187]A personal loan from the Sheriff. \n[188]How so? You have not raised a finger to protect me. \n[189]It was my choice to do this alone. \n[190]Aslan, if I didn't know better, I would swear you were worried about me. \n[191]Then we shall take from him and his rich friends. \n[192]Will, do you think the Sheriff will give everything back after I am gone? \n[193]Alright, Will. You can take me in on one condition. You must fight me. You may use the Sheriff's horse and arm yourself as you please. I will fight on foot. Unarmed. \n[194]If you lose, you will accept me as your leader. If you win, you may take me in. Dead or alive. \n[195]I am grateful for your concern, friends, but I have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds. I am ready, Will. \n[196]Come on, you little piss pot. Do your worst! \n[197]The horse is smarter than you are, Will. \n[198]Here, Will!   You aim like a girl, Will! \n[199]Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull. \n[200]Nottingham has taken from us everything we own. Now we are going to start taking from him. \n[201]We are going to tax him. \n[202]How many? \n[203]Twenty?   They usually have five. \n[204]This is no ordinary convoy. \n[205]Er, about ten. Why scare them? They can't count anyway. \n[206]Let's go. \n[207]Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free. \n[208]Ah, I feared as much. \n[209]This treasure had a purpose.     We must find out what. \n[210]Get off him.   He's a man of the cloth. \n[211]It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person. \n[212]A moment, my reverend friend. You travel with poor company when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers. \n[213]My men are thirsty and have much to celebrate. \n[214]Surely the Lord has the charity to spare a few barrels to good Christian men. \n[215]You leave when I say. \n[216]Never!   Whoomf! \n[217]Yield yourself! \n[218]Yield to Robin Hood. \n[219]Well, Friar Tuck. We have need of an honest man of God, to minister to these men and their families. What do you say? \n[220]Giddyup, Friar. \n[221]What do you say now, Tuck?    Here are the meek of the earth. \n[222]You will not regret it. \n[223]Buy yourself a new son, Stephen. \n[224]I believe you. But this Arab here, he's got it into his barbarian brain that you know a whole lot more than nothing. \n[225]And when he gets like this, he's very hard to reason with. \n[226]I strongly advise you to talk. He hasn't eaten in weeks. \n[227]You. \n[228]No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan. ... How about this other one?... Fatter, yes... more meat. \n[229]I cannot stop him, John. Besides, if they will not tell what they know, then they must pay the price. \n[230]Well, roughly, he says that he doesn't care for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you. \n[231]Thanks to our cannibal friend. \n[232]To hire mercenaries. The Celts are savage tribesmen, trained to kill from birth. \n[233]Since he also has every Smith in the country working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war. \n[234]Good morning, Lady Marian. \n[235]Ah well... er, let me finish this bath you wished me to take. Then I'll explain. \n[236]If you will be patient, I could spare your propriety by... \n[237]As you wish. \n[238]Nottingham robs the poor. We rob Nottingham and give back to the poor. \n[239]Somebody has to take a stand. \n[240]Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard. \n[241]The King is not in England to be challenged, is he? While he is away, he may lose his country. You are Richard's cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you. \n[242]I am sending Duncan with you. Give him some warm food and a real bed. I grow tired of his bellyaching. \n[243]Don't tell him I told you, but he may be useful to you. There is no one to whom I would rather entrust your safety. \n[244]Will you send word to the King? \n[245]We have to be ready to move camp at any time. The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night. \n[246]The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest you let the Arab try. If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my life. \n[247]What are you going to do? \n[248]The knife? \n[249]Horses? By the Lord, what are her chances? \n[250]Now you tell me! \n[251]Is she gone? \n[252]What did you say? \n[253]The dancing demon! Good morning. \n[254]They need help. \n[255]Are you sure it was a Druid mask? Damn them to hell! They must have Marian. Do you know where they meet? \n[256]No! You stay here, dammit!    I will go alone. \n[257]Then be my friend. There are women and children here in greater need of your courage. \n[258]Marian! \n[259]Why, Marian? \n[260]I love you. \n[261]Where is Marian? \n[262]Marian? \n[263]You have fulfilled your vow.   Now you can leave. \n[264]You ignored my request. \n[265]Because of you, another good man is dead. \n[266]To hell with your damn vow. \n[267]The forest!   Ride! \n[268]Wulf, stay here. I need your horse. \n[269]What are you doing?    Out of my way! \n[270]Out of my way, damn you! \n[271]You were an honor to your countrymen today, Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights. \n[272]Well, the war is over. \n[273]There is too much blood on my hands. \n[274]My pride brought us to this. \n[275]I gave them nothing but false hope. Tomorrow we will disperse. These people can move south and start over. You must go home and win your Jasmina. \n[276]I am no longer your responsibility. \n[277]Damn you, Arab. I want you out of my life. Can't you understand that? Go home. Go back to your own kind. \n[278]Damn you, too, Father.   You reared a coward and a fool. \n[279]Will!    I thought you were taken. \n[280]How did you escape? \n[281]And will you? \n[282]John, wait.    Let us hear what he has to say. \n[283]A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness. Will walked in and announced himself. \n[284]Let him speak. \n[285]You were to use this news to get close to me, and then kill me? Right, Will? \n[286]What is your intention, Will? \n[287]How so? \n[288]You present quite a choice.    What would you have me do, Will? \n[289]And if I stay, will you all stay with me? \n[290]There's your answer, Will.    We finish it. \n[291]Will it work? \n[292]You are truly a wizard. \n[293]We have no armored knights, no glorious banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all England. \n[294]We may be only six men, but... \n[295]Fanny, show me the exact location of the scaffold. \n[296]Friends!   We must raise the gate. \n[297]Light all the barrels, Tuck. \n[298]Jump! \n[299]Where is she? Where is Lady Marian? \n[300]Ah!   There is my answer. \n[301]Marian, run!   It's me, Robin. Run! \n[302]I warned you, I would find you no matter what. \n[303]Watch out! \n[304]This is for my father. \n[305]I'm your sworn protector.   Any way I see fit. \n[306]I think she's feeling better. \n[307]It will mend. \n[308]Aslan, my friend. \n[309]Here, Tuck. Look after him.    You deserve each other. \n[310]Who would dare refuse his king's request? \n[311]We are deeply honored by Your Majesty's presence. ", "ASLAN": "\n[1]Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them. \n[2]No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic. \n[3]If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded. \n[4]In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil? \n[5]Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal. \n[6]Those are my burdens. \n[7]It is close to sunset. \n[8]Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your cursed country? \n[9]Which way is East? \n[10]East? \n[11]East?!!! \n[12]Damn you!... Jasmina. \n[13]Which way is East? \n[14]Are you sure? \n[15]Worth dying for. \n[16]I will fulfill my vow when I choose. \n[17]You whine like a mule.   You are still alive. \n[18]A flesh wound. Why did you let their leader go? \n[19]The conquering hero returns. \n[20]With feather pillows? \n[21]Easy... Look at him. \n[22]Come, friend. \n[23]Like a rock. \n[24]It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long. \n[25]Er... no. \n[26]A fine Saracen name. \n[27]Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no offense. By the prophet! What is the man doing? \n[28]Wait! \n[29]A fine, wet army. I have never witnessed a storm of such duration. When does summer come to this land? \n[30]Then Allah truly is great. \n[31]No food, no shelter,   and weather that would curse the   end of the earth. We  will all   quickly be dead, and I shall be   rid of my vow. \n[32]What is this place? \n[33]The hospitality here is as warm as the weather. \n[34]Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast. \n[35]Twenty or more. In battle armor. \n[36]Treat it like a woman. \n[37]Have you never had a woman? Gently, man. Soothe it! \n[38]Softly.   With your knees. \n[39]Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap. \n[40]Here they come. Look. \n[41]No.    Arab science. \n[42]How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem? \n[43]Allah protect us from the evil spirits. \n[44]Cease your mad laughing.     I can feel them. \n[45]You seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life. \n[46]Your avenging army, my friend. \n[47]All they need is a leader. \n[48]Defeat him and they will follow you. \n[49]With regrets, I decline. \n[50]On the contrary. I thank you, but my faith prevents me from partaking in such enjoyments. \n[51]I have led you wrong. This is no army. These men live like dogs. \n[52]Learn what?   To build kennels? \n[53]You should not have left without me, Englishman. \n[54]Before I had a choice. \n[55]A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge. \n[56]This man has true purpose.    He means to kill you. \n[57]Here they come. \n[58]Two wagons.   Twenty escort. \n[59]And they call me the barbarian. \n[60]Perhaps it is time for some heathen persuasion. \n[61]England. \n[62]By Allah, leeches! \n[63]Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she and the child will die. \n[64]Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct us to preserve life. \n[65]Your baby has not turned. It cannot be born without help. \n[66]If you will allow me, I can help her. It will not be without danger. \n[67]If you do not listen to me, she will certainly die. And the child, too. \n[68]Bring me a needle, thread, water, a skinning knife, and burning ashes. \n[69]The child must be taken out by the knife. \n[70]I have seen it many times with horses. \n[71]After wasting so much blood... not good. \n[72]Are you ready?... Bite down on this... Robin, hold her steady. \n[73]It is a boy. \n[74]Your son, my lady... Robin, hold her skin together while I sew her up. \n[75]Alas, I am not permitted... \n[76]This must be a truly evil potion, to make the soul feel this good. \n[77]Come, holy man. A toast to all of Allah's children. The true believers and the fat infidels. \n[78]If it was Jehovah who created this brew, he is truly wise. He built the punishment into the crime. \n[79]We will go there. \n[80]You forget yourself.   I am not your servant. \n[81]Take my eyes, then. \n[82]Behind you! \n[83]They have poisoned you. There are herbs that can alter a man's brain. I know of only one cure. \n[84]It worked for me this very morning. You will thank me for this later. \n[85]Your gratitude warms my heart. \n[86]It is fortunate that I did. \n[87]He urged me to bring him. He was a brave man and I grieve for him. Praise be to Allah that I do not grieve for you also. Or for my broken vow. \n[88]I am glad you are feeling better. \n[89]I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose. \n[90]Does the witch still have possession of your senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help. And do some damage to the enemy. \n[91]It was a fiendish mind that planned this campaign. \n[92]This war is the God of Abraham against the forces of evil. \n[93]No, friend. It was you who gave these men pride. \n[94]And you? \n[95]That is for me to decide. \n[96]To the end, friend. \n[97]I have prayed for you, often, my brother. But, let us put prayer aside and help our gods in a more practical manner. I must reveal to you the mysteries of the black powder. \n[98]There is no such thing. But if there was... ... I would surely be one. \n[99]You talk too much! \n[100]Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. \n[101]For Allah!... For Jehovah! For brotherhood!... For justice! \n[102]Ali akbar! \n[103]What you fear is not below. \n[104]I'm going home the easy way, Robin. \n[105]I have no strength, Brother Tuck. \n[106]Please!

The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him. \n[8]Your men were probably drunk.   Yet you survived, cousin? \n[9]Quiet! \n[10]What do you see? \n[11]London? \n[12]Move the capitol to Nottingham? Excellent. How? \n[13]Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who? \n[14]Ally with royal blood. What else do you see? \n[15]Whose? \n[16]And victory? \n[17]Whose? \n[18]What is wrong? \n[19]Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake. \n[20]Kill them both. \n[21]You have done well, Mortianna. Exceedingly well. No one shall harm you, I swear it. \n[22]Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's. Take her. You have earned her. \n[23]Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power. \n[24]You shine like the sun, my lady. \n[25]You have been meeting with young Robin of Locksley. My cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses. \n[26]I deeply regret it, and I promise you he will be brought to justice. For subjecting you to such treatment, I will hang him from the walls with his own entrails. \n[27]My dear, a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone. If you would consent to bring your household within the city walls, I could give your needs my most personal attention. \n[28]Alas, the King has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return. \n[29]If you kill me, you will hang. \n[30]What do you want? \n[31]I'm listening. \n[32]Why should I? \n[33]Empty words. \n[34]Never, fool. \n[35]Starve them out. Slaughter their livestock. I want to see Locksley's own people fighting each other to bring him to us. \n[36]Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger than our native blades. Any losses? \n[37]Yet again you are the sole survivor, cousin? Interesting. And the gold? \n[38]Robin Hood? \n[39]Robin Hood. \n[40]Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us. \n[41]And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me. It is indeed fine steel. \n[42]How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero. \n[43]Then we   will be more cunning. I must be   rid of him. We may not be able   to intercept his next warning   to the King. \n[44]Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood. \n[45]This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest.  He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. \n[46]I want prisoners. \n[47]Nevertheless, I need prisoners. \n[48]Would you prefer pain or death? \n[49]Torture him. \n[50]And you?   Pain or death? \n[51]Torture him... you see, it makes no difference. \n[52]You will all be tortured. You will all tell me all you know about Robin Hood, and then you will all be hanged. Then we will catch your beloved Robin Hood and do the same to him. \n[53]Why would I need you? \n[54]And you can succeed? \n[55]If you fail, I will personally cut out your lying tongue. \n[56]His friends will.. ... torture him! \n[57]It will look better. \n[58]How is my bride? \n[59]Ah... You are overwhelmed with happiness. \n[60]When we are married, thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king. As you predicted. \n[61]What do you see in the portents? \n[62]Di not give me riddles, woman. We are to be married within hours. How can we be in danger? \n[63]Tell me how it will result. \n[64]Confound you, crone. Without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it. \n[65]Ah, the turncoat. Did you succeed? \n[66]Stretch his neck with the others. \n[67]Locksley, here? Where ? \n[68]Release him!... Now, where is he? \n[69]We will find him. \n[70]Put Hood in my hands, you go free. \n[71]Damn your worthless hide!    Just tell me where he is. \n[72]You'll get your reward. Where is he? \n[73]Step down, friar. \n[74]This man claims you have outlaws concealed in these barrels. Among them the cursed Robin Hood. \n[75]Break one open! \n[76]Here's another message to Robin Hood, written in your blood. \n[77]Lower the portcullis! Now! \n[78]Too slow, fool! \n[79]Seal the entrance. Guard it with your lives. ... Bring the bishop to my chapel. \n[80]Come!   It is time for the union. \n[81]Marry us. When I am declared king, that rabble will not dare go against us. \n[82]No companions? No army? You rush to your death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool... Recognize this, Locksley? \n[83]Appropriate I should use it to kill you with, don't you think? \n[84]You should have stayed away, Locksley.

A most disagreeable experience. \n[27]I would like to see that, my lord. \n[28]I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from the heart, but for now I prefer to stay in my family's ancestral home. My cousin, King Richard, will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare. \n[29]Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will return. When he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects. \n[30]Please excuse my clumsiness. \n[31]How dare you! \n[32]You send men to drag me from my home in the middle of the night, like some slave girl?
