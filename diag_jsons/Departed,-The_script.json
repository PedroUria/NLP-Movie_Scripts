{"dialogues": {"COLIN": "\n[1]Yes. \n[2]Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the first time in the history of fire. Or pussy. \n[3]innocently stretching for the idea \n[4]Douchebag! \n[5]Thank you, Sergeant. \n[6]Thank you, sir. \n[7]Thanks, hon. \n[8]SIU. What a country. \n[9]I don't mind going it alone. If you could go it alone you might get somewhere yourself. \n[10]I know you're a worker. I might be able to do something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work looking like you're gonna invade Poland. \n[11]I'm a State Police detective. \n[12]...No. \n[13]I have a cosigner. \n[14]Give me the fuckin' papers. \n[15]What was his name? The, ah, departed. \n[16]I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's. \n[17]Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those responsible. Don't you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a robbery and then killed him? \n[18]\"Allegedly\". \n[19]You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick? That's not what you think he did wrong. \n[20]You get that? \n[21]Welcome to the neighborhood. \n[22]Making a house call? \n[23]No, no. I know what you do. I know who you are. \n[24]When guys have to \"use their \"service revolvers\" in the \"course of duty\" they get to talk to you about their \"feelings\" and whatnot. \n[25]No. Oh, I know how it goes. You're a mental health professional. \n[26]That's good. They're all fuckin' crazy on that floor. I'm one floor up. \n[27]That's right. Fancy. \n[28]Yeah, I'm also getting my law degree. \n[29]They don't run Harvard Law at night, last time I checked. \n[30]Before I went to fucking Suffolk. \n[31]Well I thought you were, and for that you have to take me to dinner. \n[32]Whatever it takes. I'll stab someone in the heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you. \n[33]I don't need a card, I'm a detective. \n[34]I'm only joking. Nice to meet you... \"Madolyn\". \n[35]I didn't know about your tail until I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day. \n[36]You also do probation work, right? \n[37]Bad guys. \n[38]That have this and they don't have duck l'orange. \n[39]Oh, the lobster was excellent. I just thought, French restaurant... \n[40]I don't know what you're gonna do, but if it moves I'm going to arrest it . \n[41]What's it like having people \"find themselves?\" All day long people \"finding themselves.\" Does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room? \n[42]Yes I do. \n[43]Who says I want to see you again? \n[44]Yes, course I do. What Freud said about the Irish is We're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis. \n[45]Tough luck for you with a client list of Mick cops, isn't it. \"Opening up\"? Good luck to you. \n[46]Why do you do it? \n[47]Fair enough. \n[48]Including the criminals? \n[49]Me? I'd just arrest innocent people. I'll arrest you right now. \n[50]You don't know the half of it. \n[51]The principles of detection tell me that these men came from Providence. \n[52]This is my crime scene, but knock yourself out. \n[53]I saw a dead guy. I think I have post traumatic stress. You available for lunch? See you then. \n[54]In the trunk or the glove box?... All right. \n[55]Wanna see some dead guys? \n[56]This will get Captain Ellerby on the six o'clock news. \n[57]I've been put in charge of this unit. It is a small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn't take this job in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to conduct yourselves accordingly. \n[58]Hi, Captain. And our primary target is obviously Frank Costello. But we don't communicate with anyone else in this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It's the right thing to do, personally I don't trust these fucking troopers either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello's got a rat in the State Police. \n[59]Yeah.   Really. \n[60]No. Ah...not presently. Not presently. But I'm hoping to get things...reorganized. That's it. Congratulations. Don't disappoint me. \n[61]Hello Dad. I have a new job.  \n[62]I'm not making enough progress with Costello? \n[63]Jimmy Pappas. \n[64]He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it's been in the papers. \n[65]It's a result. \n[66]Cui gives a shit. It's got a bow on it. \n[67]What have you got? \n[68]At least one. He's one of Costello's crew. \n[69]Who's the lawyer? \n[70]Did he beep him? \n[71]All right. \n[72]Give me your phone. Turn the camera off. Turn it off. \n[73]Give my your phone and turn the fucking camera off. Who's is this? I'm gonna take this. \n[74]Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon. \n[75]What do you think? Did you make any statements or phone calls I need to be aware of? \n[76]That's it? Don't you have to call your mother and tell her you're not gonna be home for supper? \n[77]The cameras are off. Call your mother. \n[78]Lookit. They're in there suiting up for a raid. I don't know where they are going, but they do. And so do you. Call your mum. \n[79]I think you need another attorney, after all, Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day. \n[80]Run the last number called. That'll be his house. Whatever the location is I'll swear I surveilled him at it. Abracafuckindabra. \n[81]Because you didn't go in there. \n[82]I gotta go to work. \n[83]Did you guys know anything about this? \n[84]Go find out what we're doing and get on it. \n[85]Dad? \n[86]I'm not going to make dinner. Something big has come up. \n[87]Oh, my friends are still coming. \n[88]We'll just say lunch tomorrow.   All right, bye. \n[89]Thank you, Captain. \n[90]All right. That's Costello right there. Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new guy...Time is 10.46. \n[91]Good morning. \n[92]How was the last night in the, ah, old establishment? \n[93]I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked here, too. \n[94]Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So am I. \n[95]Yeah. Hey, can I... \n[96]Well, we're not having this out. \n[97]You don't see any pictures of where I came from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might have company. \n[98]Why work for the state? \n[99]Not forever, and you don't have to. You've got degrees...you're a hot shit... I mean, what you do, why make as much as a guidance counselor? \n[100]Now you're just being ridiculous. \n[101]Yes I do. \n[102]Answer it.     You live here. \n[103]Who is it? \n[104]Hello? \n[105]Something for work. \n[106]Nothin', nothin'. It doesn't have any power, that's all. It just happened once. \n[107]Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in, so she moved in. \n[108]Last time I checked, I tipped you off and you're not in jail. \n[109]Yes. \n[110]Yes. Yes I do. \n[111]I been gettin' that same feeling. \n[112]Look, I have no access to undercover files in Queenan's department. It's locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the snitches. They don't give anybody a peep. I'm doing the best... \n[113]Please Frank, if you don't relax I can't relax. Let's start with this...get me all the information on the people around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first names. Get me... \n[114]Okay, Frank...I'm sorry...could you please get me social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names, dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything that you don't get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a... \n[115]What? \n[116]No, no, no. That was a guy who works for me. \n[117]Not exactly. There are certain things I will not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an ongoing investigation. (Or your own life. There really are things connected to my job that you can't ask about. That you don't want to know about. \n[118]I will.    Thank you. \n[119]You still wanna stay? \n[120]All right. All right.       I'm coming. \n[121]I don't get it. \n[122]Right. \n[123]Well, that's just a dream job for a cop. \n[124]No. \n[125]Everything's great. On schedule. She's a doctor. \n[126]Oh, it's working. Overtime. \n[127]Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you. \n[128]Frank, we got problems. \n[129]I don't crack up. \n[130]Why did you show up then? \n[131]Why am I not fuckin' surprised. Look... \n[132]How the fuck did you know that? \n[133]I have to find myself. \n[134]I have to find the guy you have in the department. \n[135]Frank, for me, you've got to lay low. \n[136]Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank, what good am I to you if you don't listen to me? Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's fuckin' smart, you know that. I will find this rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job. \n[137]Why would you need to remind me of that? I didn't know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how to do this. \n[138]It involves lying, and I'm pretty fucking good at that, right? \n[139]No. \n[140]No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I would have heard about it. \n[141]Morning. \n[142]A problem? \n[143]The day you wouldn't take a promotion, you let me know. And I wouldn't even have a job if you did yours. \n[144]I need to know the identity of your undercovers. \n[145]Morning, Captain. \n[146]They are not happy with me. Especially Staff Sergeant Dignam. \n[147]Fair enough. Well one of them has to be dirty, We know that, right? \n[148]Who is that? \n[149]Fair enough. \n[150]Really?   Did he get a look at him? \n[151]Nothing that could help us? \n[152]\n[153]This is Sullivan. I need constant surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now. \n[154]If I wasn't with the Mass State Police. If I did it full time,law school, I'd be through in a year. I'm thinking that. If I wasn't a trooper. \n[155]Nothing. Nothing. There's nothing going on. Just thinking. \n[156]I got some money. Another city...I'm thinking that. \n[157]I want you to know you don't gotta stay. If we're not going to make it, it's got to be you that gets out. I'm not capable I'm fuckin' Irish, so I'll deal with something being wrong for the rest of my life. \n[158]Yes, go ahead. \n[159]I have to follow every lead, however unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking sensibilities. \n[160]I have reason to believe that Queenan is Costello's informer. Follow him, and don't get made. \n[161]I think I've got him. I think Queenan is meeting with him right now. \n[162]Yes. \n[163]What came off the roof? What do you mean something came off the roof? Go again with that information. \n[164]No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking information here. What came off the building? \n[165]No. \n[166]I told Internal Investigations to follow him. \n[167]That's internal Investigations business. \n[168]I have to investigate everybody and anybody. I don't have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now have information... \n[169]from a very good source...that Queenan may have been killed by his own undercover. \n[170]Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a locked file. I need those files unlocked. \n[171]That's a lie. \n[172]What? \n[173]I need those codes. \n[174]Your shouldn't have killed Queenan. \n[175]You're crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who has all the information. And Dignam's not in the office, he's gone. He resigned. \n[176]He's fucking gone. They took his papers in. He's not talking. I don't know where he is. \n[177]I will. \n[178]Yeah. \n[179]So it is you. Thank God you're all right. We were very worried. \n[180]You're talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I'm taking over Queenan's unit. \n[181]Staff Sgt. Dignam has... taken a leave of absence. He's very upset. We're all very upset. The best thing would be for your to come in. We need you to come in. \n[182]Don't go. You've got a tail. Two cars. Not very subtle. They won't be subtle from now on. That's what I've been trying to tell you. \n[183]There's no need to go yourself, Frank. \n[184]I will.   All right. \n[185]Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your team to stop following Costello. We don't need to surveil him. \n[186]I have it from an undercover: Costello knows he's being followed. Let our UC take him in. \n[187]Queenan's guy. He called me when he found out Queenan was dead. I'm running him. \n[188]No. But I can give you Costello's destination. \n[189]Yes. And what he's about to do. Call off the tail, and get Special Ops. Get them on standby. We meet him where he's going. Suit up. We're gonna take this prick tonight. \n[190]It's the heavy equipment warehouse Costello owns on Sheffield. He must have a container or a truck in there. Go. \n[191]There's an exit on the other side. Cover it. We'll take him when he comes out. \n[192]You're an FBI informant. \n[193]Do they know who I am? \n[194]Did you give me up? \n[195]Frank, Frank, do they know about me? \n[196]A son...to you? Is that what it is about, all that murderin' and fuckin' and no sons? What are you, shooting blanks? \n[197]I got Costello! I got Costello here! \n[198]It's not any reason for, ah... \n[199]Thank you. \n[200]Caller ID. On Queenan's phone. You know that guy? \n[201]I'm gonna go talk to him. \n[202]Good to see you Trooper. \n[203]Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How long have you been undercover? \n[204]I can't begin to tell you what a debt we owe you. I want you to know I'll be recommending you for the Medal of Merit. \n[205]It's the highest honor we got. \n[206]You want to be a cop again? \n[207]A police shrink. Was that... helpful for you? \n[208]I'm gonna find him. Don't you worry about that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything... \n[209]Fair enough. You've given a lot. I can get you your file. I just need your password. \n[210]All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I'm gonna go in the other room. This computer's gone blooey on me. \n[211]I was dreaming... \n[212]I was dreaming I was dead. \n[213]What's this? \n[214]Really? \n[215]Really? \n[216]You're joking... \n[217]What? \n[218]Your guys shouldn't have done that. \n[219]I'm now in charge of everything here. Including Queenan's informers. Theoretically. I can't unlock the files until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam. \n[220]He's fucking resigning. He put his papers in. He's not talking. \n[221]I can explain. \n[222]What do you want? \n[223]Where are you? \n[224]Did we not talk about this?   This is my job. \n[225]Put the fuckin' gun down. \n[226]I came here to talk some fucking sense to you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and I can get you your money. \n[227]I can get you your... \n[228]Fuck, shit... \n[229]Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was my informant. \n[230]What is this, a citizen's arrest? Blow me, prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody knows who you are. \n[231]I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU. \n[232]Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what happens. \n[233]Watch what happens. \n[234]That's the stupidest thing you could do. \n[235]Help me. \n[236]Shoot the fuckin' prick. \n[237]Shoot the motherfucker! \n[238]I can't wait for you to try to explain this to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun. \n[239]Just fucking kill me. \n[240]All right. Give me that. \n[241]At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now understand to have been Francis Costello's informer in SIU, intercepted us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan's undercover weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they had expired. \n[242]I'd like to go on record that I am recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit. \n[243]What about the baby? \n[244]", "BILLY": "\n[1]That's great. Your mom must be a wonderful woman. \n[2]Look at it this way, you're a black guy in Boston. You don't need any help from me to be completely fucked. \n[3]BROWN is left thinking about this.  \n[4]Rage issues and lower median IQ. \n[5]Sir, I was agreeing with you about our obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir. \n[6]Sir, yes sir. \n[7]Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea... \n[8]Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh. \n[9]That's right. I remember his funeral. \n[10]That's right. \n[11]What's this got to do with me? \n[12]And one priest. Since you seem to know everything. \n[13]You a psychiatrist? \n[14]Well. Families are always rising or falling in America. Am I right? \n[15]Hawthorne. \n[16]I'm all set without your personal job application, Sergeant. \n[17]Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it you want from me? \n[18]You sure of that? \n[19]I don't have any family. \n[20]You mean Stephanie who was the only one who came to my father's funeral? That Stephanie? \n[21]Nothing much to it Uncle Edward. \n[22]When you say \"family\", what do you mean? You? \n[23]Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some good to have a question from time to time. \"Am I an asshole?\" \"Are my kids a mess?\" \"Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?\" Those are questions. \"Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?\" Too late now, right? \n[24]When my mother dies we don't have any connection. You got it? \n[25]So what do I do? \n[26]Every weekend...Sergeant. \n[27]Who wants to know? \n[28]My cousin. \n[29]Aunt Cathy? \n[30]I got kicked out about four months ago. \n[31]Well. So you know. \n[32]I brought your mother some pictures of my father. \n[33]My mother had them. My mother's dead. \n[34]No. \n[35]Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think. \n[36]Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance. \n[37]In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back? \n[38]That's what I'm saying. \n[39]You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin. \n[40]Why would you even think of stopping drinking? \n[41]Who says? \n[42]A cranberry juice. \n[43]Get your hands off me. \n[44]No. \n[45]Yeah. Excellent. Fine. \n[46]Yeah. \n[47]Yeah. \n[48]Cranberry juice. \n[49]You guys from Providence? \n[50]No. \n[51]Is his real name Mister French? \n[52]Is it something I can't do personally? \n[53]Search me? Search me for what? \n[54]Yeah. He's dead. \n[55]He didn't complain. \n[56]Who said he had a fuckin' problem. \n[57]Are you saying he was nothing? \n[58]No. \n[59]I am not a cop. \n[60]Yes! \n[61]Thank you. \n[62]Yeah, he was president before Lincoln. \n[63]I'd like to squeeze some fuckin' money out of it. \n[64]I won't do it if I have to wear a wire. No wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don't know what this is like. Micro what? \n[65]What the fuck. I didn't know.... \n[66]Yeah, well. Fuck. \n[67]He was... \n[68]Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn't no reason----he put his hand in his coat! I don't know if he's a bookie or what the fuck he's doing... \n[69]Pays you. \n[70]I got it. \n[71]I got it. \n[72]Don't look. There's a white van across the parking lot? \n[73]What, do you got x-ray vision? \n[74]I don't know. \n[75]Anyone not a criminal is a minus? \n[76]He never, ah, I mean never? \n[77]So what are talking about here? \n[78]Look at it this way. It's like a tuba. I want to see if I can get something out of it. \n[79]With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school's out. \n[80]I'm going fuckin' nuts. I can't be someone else every day. \n[81]I'm not them. \n[82]Maybe I'll fucking kill you. \n[83]When are you going to take Costello? What's wrong with taking 'em on any one of the million felonies you've seen him do. Get him for pissing in the street. \n[84]What, are you waiting for him to chop me up and feed me to the poor? \n[85]There's something wrong. \n[86]Are you serious? \n[87]Jesus H. Christ. \n[88]Okay. \n[89]It's like confession. Isn't it. This sort of thing. \n[90]People make things up in confession. You know that? \n[91]People are liars. They want to be stars of their little films. \n[92]Do you lie? \n[93]I'm asking if you lie. \n[94]You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it? \n[95]So, you had a parent who was a drunk? \n[96]No. \n[97]There was a cop leaving when I came in. \n[98]Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air of scumbag entitlement. You see cops? \n[99]You should get a better job... \n[100]Do they all come in and cry...your cops? \n[101]Let me tell you something. They signed up to use their fuckin' weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so they know they have to \"weep\" after they use their weapons. No one's more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV. \n[102]You want to hear about the showers? \n[103]No. You sit there with a mass murderer, your heart-rate jacked, your hand...steady. That's one thing I found out about myself in prison. My hand doesn't shake, ever. \n[104]I have to come here. \n[105]You want the truth? Valium. \n[106]What's that say about what you do for a living? \n[107]I'm having panic attacks. You didn't even ask about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven't slept for weeks. \n[108]Yes. I said something true. I want some fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell the truth here. \n[109]If only fuckin' here. \n[110]Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct of ...privacy, of, of, self reliance... that he has, and you don't help him? You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?! (Is that what you do, Mrs. Fuckin' Doctor? \n[111]Two pills. \n[112]Why don't you just give me a bottle of scotch and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this psychiatry bullshit? \n[113]What if that was a legitimate threat? . \n[114]Because you're bored and tired and don't give a shit. It's not supernatural. \n[115]What's this? \n[116]Is it enough to kill myself? \n[117]Thank you. \n[118]You wanna get a cup of coffee? \n[119]What about us, Frank?   What're we gonna do? \n[120]I'm gonna get on a plane unless you put Queenan on the phone. \n[121]Why shouldn't I get on a fucking plane? Meet up? Do you actually want me dead? There's a rat in your unit. That's a fact. You just don't know it. Where's Queenan? \n[122]They knew you had cameras in the building. You have a leak from the inside. It's real. Smoke him out. \n[123]Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you're getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello's apartment. Don't tell anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out of the pipe on my end. That's first. Narrow it down.

I'm just curious... \n[130]Then you're lucky.   Considering the odds, right? \n[131]Good, give him a shot. \n[132]Yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. Godlike, really. \n[133]What would you do if he was standing right there and saw us? \n[134]You take off an armored car at the Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence? \n[135]What the fuck do you do. \n[136]FBI? What the fuck are you talking about. \n[137]What the fuck did you just say about the FBI? \n[138]Whatever's going through your very poor, very limited, brain...I'm not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just fucking said. \n[139]Tell me what the fuck you said. \n[140]Let's go. \n[141]Hey, it's me. \n[142]Come here. \n[143]Costello is giving people up to the \n[144]He gives information to the FBI. He's a protected informant. Aren't they trying to make it a Federal case? And it never gets made? \n[145]No, I... \n[146]I don't have a bank account. \n[147]What's he doing, setting up IRAs? \n[148]No, no, no. Jesus Christ. \n[149]I'm not sitting in this room without a tetanus shot. I'm not staying. \n[150]Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU. \n[151]Your name's on the pill label. I thought you weren't supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients. \n[152]Medium. \n[153]I really liked our conversations. I've been...regretting that we didn't continue...our conversations. \n[154]Thanks. If this is inappropriate... I can leave. \n[155]You moving in or out? \n[156]Yeah, I know. \n[157]Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you. \n[158]Sugar?   No... \n[159]Hedging your bets? \n[160]Decision. \n[161]Move in with your boyfriend? \n[162]Yeah, I think so. \n[163]You don't have cats. \n[164]I like that. That's good. \n[165]No.   No.   What does that matter? \n[166]What about the FBI. \n[167]Stupid...Well, that leaves me out. \n[168]Better safe than sorry, I suppose. \n[169]I look around at your guys. They're all murderers right? I think \"could I do murder?\" And all I can answer myself is, \"what's the difference\". \n[170]Yeah, that's my point. You accuse me once, I put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody else. \n[171]You're seventy fucking years old. One of these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You don't need the pain in the ass, and they're going to catch you. And you don't need the money. \n[172]Is there something you want to ask me, Frank? \n[173]You said there is one. I base most of what I do on the idea that you're pretty fucking good at what you do. \n[174]How many of these guys been with you long enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You don't pay much, you know. It's almost a feudal fuckin' enterprise. The question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than you? \n[175]I probably could be you. I know that much. But I don't want to be you. \n[176]I thought I was on for that. \n[177]Huh? \n[178]Right. I'm going home. He's playing with his new boys. \n[179]Later. \n[180]He's moving something with all new guys.  I don't want to tell you what or where. It might be disinformation. It probably is. Just keep following him. I need to see you today. No. Today. \n[181]Look down the car. \n[182]Got me? \n[183]Any reason you'd have a tail? \n[184]I'm watching a guy... \n[185]Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait there for ten minutes. After I leave I'll text message you the address where we'll meet. I'll make sure you don't have a tail. \n[186]I told you, he's got dope coming in, I don't know where. He's getting spooky, Captain... \n[187]He's crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood all over him. I can't get any more information for you. I can't trust it. He's not including his regular guys... I'm telling you, he's gonna find out who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill me, I know it. \n[188]Yeah?   What about the FBI? \n[189]What? \n[190]You were fucking followed. \n[191]Costello's people. \n[192]No. One of the cops he's got inside tipped him. \n[193]They'll be on the elevators, too. \n[194]What'll you do? \n[195]What the fuck happened?    I came to meet you. \n[196]Boss told me to go home. \n[197]I was in a fucking grocery store with no signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want. Was I there or was I not there? Huh? \n[198]Jesus Christ. \n[199]When you're dead it makes no difference where they put you. \n[200]What's that? \n[201]Yeah, so? \n[202]He's dead. I'm going home. \n[203]I tried to call you a few times. \n[204]It's okay, okay, I know. \n[205]You called this number on a dead guy's phone. Who are you? \n[206]Who are you? \n[207]Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it. \n[208]How do you know you don't have a tail? \n[209]What if they took one off and put another one on, Frank? \n[210]Frank told me to check out the back. You guys go ahead. \n[211]How'd you get him without the files? \n[212]Yeah.   \"Trooper\". \n[213]Long time.     Long fuckin' time. \n[214]I just want my identity back. \n[215]No, being a cop's not an identity. I want my identity back. \n[216]You'll have to excuse me. My only contact has been with a police shrink. \n[217]What are you gonna do about the rat in this building? \n[218]I'm all done being a cop.

Exactly what it says, please. \n[223]I'm sorry to show up here like this. There was no one else I could give it to. I'm sorry. There was no one else. \n[224]Whatever you have to say, really think about it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all right? \n[225]Costello recorded everything. He put all the tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little worried. \n[226]I want my identity, you two-faced rat prick. \n[227]Three o'clock. Where Queenan died. You keep your cell on. \n[228]Get your hands up.   Hands.

The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. I'm arresting you. \n[236]Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick. But I'm still fucking arresting you. \n[237][You are what you do.] Get up. I said get the fuck up. \n[238]I called you. You specifically. You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.

I'm afraid we all have to deal with it. \n[7]looking up from his papers \n[8]We have a question. You want to be a cop, or do you want to appear to be a cop. It's an honest question. Lot of guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they're on TV... \n[9]He's right. We deal in deceptions here. But what we don't deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be anything else in the world, but you won't be a Massachusetts State trooper. \n[10]I'm sure of that. \n[11]You don't have much family. \n[12]During the war, Churchill used river mines. He'd float them down the rivers into Germany. They'd either hit something, or not. That's what we'll use you for. I'll float you down the river. The rest will happen. Or it won't... \n[13]By the way, this isn't police work for peanuts. There's money behind this operation. You won't be paid as a cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free. \n[14]We can't conceal that you've been a trainee. You'll be convicted of a crime. We're thinking that a guilty plea to assault and battery might make sense. \n[15]You'll serve enough jail time to convince anyone that it's no set- up. You'll be on probation.

Everybody knows you're assigned here to find Costello's rat. They want to find the leak as much as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat. \n[48]Two days ago, my undercover guy in Costello's organization---- \n[49]Lots of luck.  You can go over my head, high as you like. You still won't get an answer. \n[50]As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly found out who Costello's rat is. He lost him in the street. \n[51]...No. \n[52]Nah. \n[53]Costello can't do  business without coordinating with his source... Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and you'll find his rat. \n[54]You're going to be looking at my people. Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don't expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me get you a coffee. \n[55]Follow Costello and you'll find his informer. \n[56]Where are you now? \n[57]No...Of course not. \n[58]I don't have a tail, Billy. \n[59]South Station.

Look, I'm not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer. I'll get you out. I can't do it overnight but I'll do it. We can bust him for what we have. At least I think we can...I hope.

I make progress every day. In fact, I'm making progress now. There are guys in this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever getting anything you could definitively call a result. It's like any American industry. Nobody minds if you don't succeed as long as you don't fuck up. \n[15]Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough. Who did the two guys from Providence? \n[16]And what happened to Jimmy Pappas? \n[17]Are you happy with this result? \n[18]Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits. \n[19]I think you are a cop, my son. \n[20]All right, let's bring it in, please. Come in please. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes, those. I don't know what they are. You don't know what they are. Who gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan's team... Will ID the bad guys and listen in on the phones. \n[21]How long have we been tapped on this building? \n[22]Our unit will not take action until a man Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction.
