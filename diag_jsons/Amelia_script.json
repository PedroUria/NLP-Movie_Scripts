You should know that by now. \n[3]That why I get so many chances to not do it? \n[4]He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated. \n[5]I figured he'd be pompous. \n[6]But to be rejected by this... parasite. A man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous. \n[7]Mr. Putnam? \n[8]Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. \n[9]I do. \n[10]I'll make it. \n[11]Always nice to know what the real attraction is. \n[12]Why would that matter? \n[13]Was that your advice? \n[14]Except for the part that goes to you. \n[15]You said she wants a flyer. \n[16]Why would anyone want a book from a passenger? \n[17]Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan... \n[18]You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I can find my way. \n[19]Fine.   What have I done? \n[20]I didn't mind waiting. Caught up on my reading. Knitted a sweater. \n[21]We. \n[22]Spoken like a gentleman. \n[23]Courage is the price that life exacts For granting peace \n[24]The soul that knows it not Knows no release From little things \n[25]As the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me. \n[26]Got it.   I think. \n[27]You're just in time. Alice has come through the Looking Glass, and things are getting, well... \n[28]They are, actually. \n[29]Has to be. Competition, you know. Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you, he'd have me publicly flogged. \n[30]So long as he could sell tickets. \n[31]Marion. She's giving me a leave of absence. \n[32]Specially if I don't make it. \n[33]Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation. \n[34]You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me? \n[35]What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure. \n[36]The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me. \n[37]George had told me Stultz was Adm. Byrd's favorite pilot, fearless, gifted. He drank. But George said it never affected his work. \n[38]We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.' \n[39]\n[40]Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel? \n[41]I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try. \n[42]Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut. \n[43]Careful.    I could get to like it. \n[44]Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for everything. \n[45]It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. \n[46]There's a Beatrix Potter story about a cat named Simpkin. \n[47]He wasn't happy unless he had several mice, each under a different teacup. So he could never become bored. \n[48]THe illusion of activity was essential for him to feel at peace. \n[49]What are you boys doing over there? \n[50]Oh god, is it worth the effort? \n[51]Valentino's not available? \n[52]Two things. One, Chaplin can't play me because he's perfect for you. And two, you have company. \n[53]Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my sis. You know. In case. \n[54]Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault. \n[55]Sam will handle that.   They trust him. \n[56]Have you. \n[57]But why is he you? \n[58]So you haven't actually read it. Do you actually read? \n[59]\n[60]Well.   See ya. \n[61]Our first hop was to Canada, to start from as close as we could get to Ireland. Just in case we couldn't get the thing in the air and had to row. \n[62]The fuel was going to be so close, every single mile counted. \n[63]George told me to keep to my room, just in case there was a reporter or two somewhere. \n[64]Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? \n[65]Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. \n[66]Hey, not even silver. \n[67]Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we're going now. \n[68]Great. Maybe Mabel will think so, too. Because if she doesn't, she's going to Paris and you're going home. Today. \n[69]It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland. \n[70]But this   is the day Mabel's ready, so we're   going now. The weather is going   to get better and we'll be there   to enjoy it. \n[71]Just as serious as you're hung over. You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane. \n[72]Slim, get out. I've got this. \n[73]I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill. He is the most caring and generous and charming and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know. He's my father. \n[74]He's a drunk. And he's let me down all my life. \n[75]Now you get out of that bed. And you fly that god-damned thing to Ireland. Or I swear to you, Bill... \n[76]I swear to you I will. Or die trying. \n[77]And either way. You're going to be living with it. \n[78]Good.     Slim, start the engines. \n[79]You signed a contract. You've got a direct instruction from me to go. That report indicates some degree of risk and it's a risk I'm taking. \n[80]Thanks. \n[81]Read tomorrow's papers, Bill. We'll both be in them. \n[82]So, to take off, you pull back on the thing, right? \n[83]\n[84]Dearest Dad. Hooray for the last grand adventure. I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway. You know that.     I have no faith we'll meet anywhere again, but I wish we might. \n[85]\n[86]\n[87]\n[88]\n[89]\n[90]Out of gas. May have to swim for \n[91]Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More important than any of us. \n[92]Public relations. \n[93]No, really, this is very sweet, it's an honor. I'm actually enjoying it. \n[94]Hullo, Hilton. \n[95]I believe you've come for these. \n[96]I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise... \n[97]This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record. \n[98]This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. \n[99]Aviation is clear today for the pioneer. And if the pioneer has good ideas nobody will ask whether \n[100]I hear your doubt. That doubt is our challenge. This is where our Atlantic flight, or any other good flight by a woman can help... \n[101]It starts women thinking. \n[102]Guess you can burn those letters. \n[103]The book's yours.     The letters are mine. \n[104]Barely enough for one. \n[105]Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over. \n[106]...if I haven't been fired. \n[107]So they took me home with them to Rye. And I lived there, while I wrote my book. \n[108]What does it say?   `I don't smoke but you should?' \n[109]True and misleading.      Why would I sign that? \n[110]`...in the prison yard, so everyone can watch and share in our...' Did you write the copy on this one, too? \n[111]You need more ammunition in these cards, and where's the goddamned humor, for Chrissake? By which I mean something actually funny! \n[112]And please remember not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your pointer, it's your face they're paying to see. Well, most of them. \n[113]And another thing. Your hats. Are a menace. \n[114]I remember the first kiss. \n[115]It's so good to meet you. I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration. \n[116]Feel like a drink? \n[117]Relax, George. I meant a Coke. \n[118]All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real. \n[119]Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip? \n[120]Keep doing what you're doing. \n[121]For a long, long time. \n[122]I can't do that. \n[123]I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. \n[124]I know me.     And you don't.   Not really. \n[125]The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does... \n[126]And when were you going to tell me? \n[127]What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work? \n[128]Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but... \n[129]But this is different. \n[130]If women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere. \n[131]You did it because you love me. \n[132]And when we're married, you mustn't ever... \n[133]What's the big shock? I thought you wanted to get married. \n[134]Well, then. \n[135]You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. \n[136]Sometimes things happen that way. You're not better safe than sorry. \n[137]...I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me. Nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly. \n[138]Hence, the article. \n[139]I'm thinking of doing it solo. \n[140]Would you mind? \n[141]I'm surprised you're all right with this... \n[142]Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died. \n[143]I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud.. \n[144]I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... \n[145]We make our own luck, you and I. Remember that. \n[146]No. \n[147]All this? G \n[148]Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half. \n[149]I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? \n[150]Stake up the peonies, huh? They're messy when they bloom on the ground, and... \n[151]I want to see their heads high. When I come home. \n[152]See ya. \n[153]The weather report wasn't perfect. But we knew our real chance was to take weather that others wouldn't. \n[154]...was that my altimeter would conk out. Never to return. \n[155]The only way to have any sense of altitude, was to keep dropping toward the sea. \n[156]When the engines sputtered, that was my low-level limit. \n[157]...before I hit the water. \n[158]...or passed out. \n[159]Excuse me, sir. Where am I? \n[160]When I left, I was aiming for Paris. \n[161]`Only an average flyer, she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists... \n[162]`Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.' \n[163]Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble. \n[164]Well, they're crazy about something. \n[165]What have we really done? \n[166]That's not enough. \n[167]The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.' \n[168]Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. \n[169]Imagine. \n[170]Ladies. \n[171]Thursday, I'll be in Boston. Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul Collins. \n[172]No, he's starting a shuttle service. Washington, New York, Boston... \n[173]Could be a money maker for us.    Get me off the lecture grind. \n[174]What on earth would you need me for? \n[175]Gene had a terrible marriage and was separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife. But he was too kind to humiliate her with a divorce... \n[176]How's Nina doing? \n[177]If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes. \n[178]Well, yeh. \n[179]Any given meal, I can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches. \n[180]At seven? \n[181]Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. \n[182]Wish you'd do something about that. \n[183]I know.   Always. \n[184]He costs money, too. \n[185]We don't have to. \n[186]Thank you. \n[187]For understanding. \n[188]The wrong Roosevelt got elected. \n[189]I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it. \n[190]his could be one of those rare \n[191]How do you feel about flying at night? \n[192]Outstanding. \n[193]Put your hands on the wheel. \n[194]It's dual controls.   No one will ever know. \n[195]Don't you trust me? \n[196]I feel like a Coke.   Can I get you something? \n[197]Do try not to hit the ground. \n[198]Have I told you what a perfect job miraculous. \n[199]Sorry. \n[200]When are you leaving? \n[201]I don't really see how I can. \n[202]Well, it's not just that. There's critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch... \n[203]What are you trying to say? \n[204]I can't think of anything helpful. \n[205]Hi. Yeh. What's today been like?       You still okay? \n[206]I suppose I thought.      It was too revealing. \n[207]I'm so glad you have it now. \n[208]Of course. Me, too. I'll call you later. \n[209]Must be the ambience.   And the nuts. \n[210]Any guy would have to be nuts to do that. I'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed. \n[211]You'll see it. \n[212]Gore, huh? \n[213]I wish. \n[214]Would make life simpler. \n[215]Actually, I'll be in Indiana. Edward Elliot of Purdue wants \n[216]me to build a women's careers department there. \n[217]I'll be back and forth. When I'm there, I've asked to stay in the dorm with the girls. \n[218]What's special about now? \n[219]Not unless someone makes me. \n[220]How thoughtless of me to be doing else is interested in making money. Present company included. \n[221]If this is about George, just say \n[222]And what's your point? Women are Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? \n[223]Well, let's change that, shall we? easier. \n[224]Thanks for the tip. \n[225]Well, I'm an open-minded girl. And as your consultant at the \n[226]The public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together. \n[227]Next time you read the papers.      Try reading between the lines. \n[228]I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights. \n[229]And that's because I haven't needed it. \n[230]I'm the lucky one. Our Department of Commerce shows no prejudice in issuing licenses to fly. A pilot is a pilot. \n[231]How about giving the rest of our women. The ones who can be productive for their families and for our nation an equal break? \n[232]They are your sisters and your daughters. They are your wives. And fellas... \n[233]You've no excuse. And you know it. \n[234]...including them wanting us to say darn instead of damn. \n[235]Don't. \n[236]Build your career first. And, surprisingly, that's the best thing you can do for your eventual marriage. \n[237]Look. It starts with a strong sexual attraction, that the \n[238]Everything works until the first financial crisis jars the man's confidence and threatens the \n[239]Because she can't help. All she can be is dependent. Because that \n[240]He says he's the man in your life. \n[241]Trust me. Only a husband talks like that. \n[242]Yes?  Yes. Yes... \n[243]I'm flying in Tuesday. Yes, of course, I'll make time. \n[244]Can you women keep a secret? \n[245]Well, it's no secret that I'm a bit driven, some might say obsessive, about my little flying adven- tures... \n[246]I've decided to embark on easily the most exciting, possibly cra- ziest, ever... \n[247]I'm going to fly. Around the world. \n[248]Are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I have to get physical? \n[249]Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost... \n[250]May as well be a billion. \n[251]And your surprise is, you robbed a bank. \n[252]Think I could help? \n[253]Cat food.    A whole case. \n[254]Dear Mr. President: Some time ago I told you and Mrs. Roosevelt about my confidential plans for a world flight. The chief problem is the jump westward from Honolulu... \n[255]As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. \n[256]It is much more. I believe that women should do for themselves what men have done - and occasionally what men have not. \n[257]This might encourage other women toward greater independence of thought and action. And I know how deeply you gentlemen desire that. \n[258]I know, of course, from my chats earlier in the evening. With each of your wives. \n[259]In that spirit, I want each of you to reach for your checkbooks... \n[260]I mean that quite literally. This is an opportunity for me to exhibit the quality my husband admires most. \n[261]The capacity. To be relentless. \n[262]Well, there's Magellan, 400 years And he died. And he used a boat. \n[263]Pretty much. \n[264]So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are? \n[265]No one's tried it.    You think I should? \n[266]Dare me. \n[267]Okay. \n[268]I'll have to refuel. \n[269]In the air. One plane to another. \n[270]Well, don't you think I can? \n[271]Pretty much. \n[272]We'll play some cards before you leave. \n[273]s that an opinion or an order? \n[274]Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that. \n[275]I've taken bigger risks. \n[276]It's your vacation home. \n[277]Don't rush me. I'm thinking. \n[278]Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. \n[279]This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. \n[280]Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it. \n[281]I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities. \n[282]Better odds of hitting that island? \n[283]Even with cloud cover? \n[284]They did. \n[285]My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul. \n[286]Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. \n[287]Hey.   How can I lose? \n[288]Did I pressure the navy to build a landing strip at Howland Island? How exactly would I do that? \n[289]The airstrip has been planned for a long time. I was thrilled to learn it will be ready in time for my flight. The navy has been wonderful, as always. \n[290]Who am I to argue with `experts?' I'll just give you my plain old common-sense thinking on this... \n[291]We may not learn much about the plane, but we will about the pilot. Endurance over a month's journey, flying nearly every day. Response will make a contribution. \n[292]I'm a working stiff like all of you. I don't apologize for the fact that I need money to live. And to keep financing my flying, which is what I love. I think that's a positive example for women. \n[293]I'm not doing this as a scientist. I'm a flyer, boys, pursuing my passion. For the fun of it. The fun of it. Something I recommend as a healthy motive for women. \n[294]...and maybe even some men. \n[295]Well, we need enough for a third pass at Howland. After you miss it the first couple times around. \n[296]...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this never coming back. \n[297]I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle. \n[298]I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years. \n[299]No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double. \n[300]This showed them how dangerous it all is, they were taking it for granted... They thought I was competent. \n[301]You mean after. \n[302]So my exit would be a stupid crash. publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before. \n[303]And what if it's not something I have to show the world? \n[304]What if it's something I have to show me. \n[305]Who let you off the hook on this? \n[306]I don't have a choice. I have to reverse my route and fly east. If hurricanes in the Caribbean and monsoons in Africa... \n[307]Well, if I do pop off, I'll try to make it somewhere that's not your fault. \n[308]But I'll have Fred so I won't miss. In fact, I'm taking Fred along for this whole trip. \n[309]Giving up my little arrogance about solo. Safety first, yes? \n[310]If you're worried about his drinking, I'll deal with it. \n[311]I can handle Fred. \n[312]I'll be flying sky no one's ever been in. You made that happen. \n[313]I'll try to make you proud. \n[314]And then what? \n[315]Oh yeh.    That. \n[316]If you'll fly the plane.   Make it twenty. \n[317]Simpkin keeps many mice at one time. Each under a different teacup. \n[318]No. \n[319]Insecure. \n[320]He needs the illusion of activity preparing for all contingencies. \n[321]That he has more irons in the \n[322]Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her. \n[323]She knows. \n[324]Don't you know I couldn't? Even if part of me wanted to. Very, very much. \n[325]How can we be anything. But what we are? \n[326]I do love you. \n[327]Thanks. \n[328]See ya. \n[329]\n[330]Stay if you like. \n[331]\n[332]\n[333]\n[334]\n[335]That's more like it. \n[336]'ve got an idea. Let's never \n[337]I'll wake you when the coffee's ready. \n[338]Oh, my goodness.   Simpkin, is it really you? \n[339]This is insane. It's so extravagant. \n[340]We can't possibly afford this. \n[341]You hang up the phone this minute. You'll bankrupt us and I'll have to walk home. \n[342]..and it's fun. \n[343]An honest one. It's what you wanted. \n[344]If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore. In that way. Not for a long time. \n[345]It was mine. \n[346]Anything but easy. Are you disapproving of the way I live? \n[347]Allow me to cut you a deal, my friend. \n[348]You show up tomorrow morning. You show up sober and you get me to Howland Island. \n[349]And I'll forget you ever said that. \n[350]Feel like stepping out for a smoke...? \n[351]...or something? \n[352]Thank you.     I'll only be a moment. \n[353]You should be working. \n[354]You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. \n[355]I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay? \n[356]I won't dare. You're a very important feline. Uh, fellow. \n[357]Fred is fine. He's calculating head-wind speed versus fuel as we speak. \n[358]He's fine. \n[359]I can handle it. \n[360]I can handle it. \n[361]I love you. \n[362]Where's that? \n[363]I'm going to like it there. \n[364]I'd better. Since this is my last flight. \n[365]t's late here. Guess I'll go \n[366]See ya. \n[367]Traveling light, that's all. \n[368]It's fine. \n[369]Everything is. \n[370]It's for my husband. I'm going to hand it to him. So I can watch his face as he reads it. \n[371]It's our tradition. \n[372]Itasca from Earhart. Overcast. \n[373]Please take bearing on us and report in half hour. I will make noise in microphone. We are about 100 miles out. \n[374]KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be on you but cannot see you... \n[375]My Simpkin. ", "GEORGE": "\n[1]The first time I met her she sat in that chair. \n[2]You may as well write it down, Mary. Write it all down. Even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring. \n[3]We'll see if I remember how to edit. \n[4]I'd kept her waiting two hours. \n[5]She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was... \n[6]Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you? \n[7]Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments. \n[8]The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was \n[9]Miss Earhart? \n[10]I asked you to sit. \n[11]A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like. \n[12]I'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean. \n[13]In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died. \n[14]Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect. \n[15]The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement... \n[16]...who is American, educated, well- spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive... \n[17]Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention. \n[18]Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name. \n[19]Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you. \n[20]Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger. \n[21]That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all. \n[22]Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight. \n[23]The job's yours. \n[24]I chose you the moment you walked through the door. \n[25]Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station? \n[26]I honestly feel an apology is in order. \n[27]I mean an apology.   For what's coming. \n[28]I'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public. It's all part of the package we're selling. \n[29]That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work. \n[30]You're the star. I'm no one at all. \n[31]Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart. \n[32]Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator. \n[33]And Bill Stultz here, simply the most talented pilot working. \n[34]We've got Byrd's pilot, we've got his plane... \n[35]Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself. \n[36]This way, if you're forced down at sea, you can wait for a rescue. \n[37]The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles. \n[38]What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile. \n[39]Simpkin. \n[40]Trying to make you look like a girl. \n[41]Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin. \n[42]Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam. \n[43]I'm honored. That you'd leave these with me. \n[44]I'll call them once you're safely on your way. \n[45]I've figured out the Simpkin thing, you know. \n[46]Sure. There are so few books I haven't published, it was easy to find. \n[47]Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of Gloucester. He's a cat in a green frock coat. \n[48]He's brilliant, charismatic... \n[49]...neurotic, compulsive, manipulative. Am I getting warmer? \n[50]I saved them for your book. \n[51]ou're the boss. \n[52]The truth is, she was a celebrity on smaller stages all her life. \n[53]This is just when the rest of us discovered her. \n[54]Lucky Strike endorsement.      I wrote the copy myself. \n[55]It says Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship. That's true. \n[56]So Bill and Slim get paid. \n[57]If you're too proud to take tobacco money, donate it to Byrd's expedition, and we get great publicity. \n[58]This week's marriage proposals. The top one's the most creative. It's from Sing Sing. \n[59]The lecture and publicity schedule was fierce. I was with her pretty much all the time. \n[60]Everything about you. Is a menace. \n[61]Amelia!   What would her mother say? \n[62]A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself. \n[63]Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? \n[64]Lovely party, huh? \n[65]Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind? \n[66]What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department. \n[67]Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton. \n[68]Well, I'm waiting for our practice conversation. Hoping I'll learn something. About honesty. \n[69]Dorothy and I are through. \n[70]It's different now. \n[71]Marry me. \n[72]If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. \n[73]Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse. \n[74]What if I promise not to learn? \n[75]If you love me. I'll take my chances. \n[76]Race you to bed. \n[77]I'll tell you why it's a front page story. Because Amelia pulled every woman out of the race. So the organizers had to roll over and give in, or they'd have lost their shirts. You want me to write your headline? \n[78]Call you back. I've got a very important guest. \n[79]Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage. \n[80]And both of those things.      Are the \n[81]I think it would be huge for women flyers if Amelia won the Derby. The publicity would put the race, and all of you, up there with the boys. \n[82]Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega. \n[83]That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week. \n[84]There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side. \n[85]You haven't changed. \n[86]Unfortunately for you, neither have I. \n[87]You can't win if you can't get a plane to enter. Let me predict that you won't. \n[88]In fact. If you reject my generosity, you may come to regret it. For a long, long time. \n[89]I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires. \n[90]She probably meant me. \n[91]Oh, sure she does. \n[92]She just doesn't care. \n[93]My job.     Is to care for her. \n[94]\n[95]he told you that I shut her out of \n[96]Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. \n[97]I didn't say that. \n[98]ou're making your life hap... \n[99]rom here on, I'll just stab men in he back. A \n[100]did.   I do. \n[101]What about what you said? The day \n[102]Hell yes. \n[103]y Amelia. Brutal in her frank- \n[104]`Why I Believe Women Pilots Can't Fly The Atlantic. An outspoken warning by Lady Heath.' `...pure suicide for any woman today...it is madness for them to attempt it and...' \n[105]`...at least the first dozen will be drowned.' And we're reading \n[106]Which is actually across the Atlantic. \n[107]Not at all. When would you like to go? \n[108]Really. \n[109]ell, they were only men.   This is \n[110]Of course not. But if I did... \n[111]...all the more reason to say yes. \n[112]Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck. \n[113]Anyway. That's what the elephant told me. \n[114]Do you have money? \n[115]I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part. \n[116]So the Simpkin thing. What was all that? \n[117]Either way, something to look forward to. \n[118]Putnam. \n[119]Is she all right? \n[120]Are they completely sure it's her plane? \n[121]ell, I'm glad someone besides me \n[122]hy would you even read that \n[123]ood. And remembering how little \n[124]He's a crackpot. Let it go. \n[125]Cheer up.     They're crazy about you. \n[126]You've made them feel like this. \n[127]Most of them are women. And for them, it's very much enough. \n[128]The question is. Can any magnif- icent display of courage be use- less?     A \n[129]One day closer, then. To the day when they won't think to throw one for you. \n[130]And.   It's fun. \n[131]If a bomb goes off tonight, the whole government of the United States is out there... \n[132]Some dog catcher will have to become President. \n[133]Boy. Imagine if you'd actually done something. \n[134]The irony is, I'd finally put that wedding day letter out of my mind. Stopped watching every beautiful accomplished man who crossed her path. \n[135]I had a call from the Byrds. They've asked us to dinner Thursday. \n[136]Don't tell me Gene wants to resurrect Transcontinental? \n[137]Gene's a dashing guy. He could talk anyone into anything. \n[138]\n[139]After Roosevelt won, his wife Eleanor brought the advancement of women to national attention with stunning success. \n[140]You have, actually. Twice. \n[141]It's all right. You've been distracted lately. \n[142]Thing is.     I'd like you to come. \n[143]I've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us. \n[144]Normally, I'd be worried about leaving you here alone. But I suppose that won't be a problem, will it? \n[145]I think I've just said it. \n[146]Is there anything you want to say? \n[147]We both cried when I called to tell her. She asked to come be with me. But I insisted she stay there, to keep on schedule for her flight. \n[148]So many treasures lost. Letters and poems she'd written. I poured through the rubble... \n[149]I mark you in the moving crowd And see again those stars a warm night lent us long ago. We loved so then. We love so now. \n[150]Thank you for writing that. \n[151]Even though I'd never seen it. \n[152]Boy, that is the last thing I'd want. \n[153]I only thought that if you're serious about this around-the-world nonsense. It might be handy to have a plane to fly in. \n[154]...$36,000. After a generous discount from Lockheed. \n[155]...not to mention at least another 36 to get it modified and ready. \n[156]Actually.    A university. \n[157]I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to create an Amelia Earhart Fund for Aeronautical Research at Purdue. And suggested a budget item of... \n[158]...oh, eighty grand. For a suitable `flying laboratory.' \n[159]Nah. \n[160]By the way. That's not the surprise. \n[161]Merry Christmas. \n[162]Can't wait to see what you got me. \n[163]Wait a minute, you're flying around the world? Don't you know a woman's place is in the home?? \n[164]I begged to go. But it seems that between 185 pounds of husband and 1 \n[165]At least, I think that's what all \n[166]We were, all of us, fearful about \n[167]Three weeks, she'll be good as new. It's a remarkable crew. The best \n[168]You cut the engines. It would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot. \n[169]t's only money, we'll figure it \n[170]Maybe.   Or... \n[171]I meant.    Or maybe we can quit. \n[172]Or.     Even now. \n[173]Yeh. That. And it would be fine \n[174]Lucky for you. \n[175]Have fun. \n[176]She'd outvote you all by herself. \n[177]Tip-top. Every little girl needs a man around. Even strong girls like ours, hmmn? \n[178]She can handle us. She can handle Fred. \n[179]Hate to think where you'd be without me. \n[180]You did that long, long ago. Only \n[181]Then the best part.    The future. \n[182]The radio problems crept up on us \n[183]and Fred were both amateurs at Morse Code, so the radio wasn't worth what it weighed. \n[184]Race you to California. I'll go west. Five bucks? \n[185]We're saying he's cruel? \n[186]Controlling? \n[187]Especially the mice. \n[188]And one of them.    Is right. \n[189]want you to give me something. \n[190]Tell me this is your last flight. \n[191]Promise. \n[192]Well, I love you back. \n[193]Mrs. Earhart? Mr. Earhart, here. . \n[194]It gets worse, I bought a brand-new suit and tie. Got a date with my wife. \n[195]ure, we can. It's Tuesday's call o Lae that we can't afford. \n[196]easoning with me. A magnificent \n[197]I'm running a big adventure here, \n[198]I thought I was lying.

Right now.      I mean it. \n[206]After the Fourth.     We're going home. \n[207]For me?   Anywhere you are. \n[208]Well.    If you insist. \n[209]I'll go tell the world you're on your way. \n[210]Sweet dreams. \n[211]Ten A.M., Friday July 2. They lined up on the thousand-yard runway.

So my kid's stuck with Dad again. \n[6]You suggesting you're less boring than I am? \n[7]Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid. \n[8]He's eight. \n[9]The next adventure.    What is it? \n[10]Because we're running out of oceans. \n[11]I'm serious, Amelia. \n[12]The only way you can stay where you are.

Specially when they make a pass at you. \n[19]You keep advertising that, but I'm still waiting to see it. \n[20]Well, here's your chance. I'm taking Gore to the conference in Bermuda. He wants you to come. \n[21]Sure.   I'm completely indifferent. \n[22]That's a wonderful idea. Especially now. \n[23]A good time for some positive press about you as a role model. \n[24]You don't read the papers? \n[25]Well, someone should. Because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. Meaning, money. \n[26]Look, George had you taking money Hawaii flight, the Mexican Government for theirs, he's selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights... \n[27]I'm sorry I said it that way. This picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about. \n[28]If you want to make money, my guess Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful. \n[29]Thanks for not being defensive. \n[30]There are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't \n[31]Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land that. \n[32]Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay? \n[33]The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy. \n[34]You're not a good enough pilot to not be able to control the Electra amount of time. \n[35]I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it. \n[36]This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists. \n[37]We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there. \n[38]Try reading the newspapers between building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention... \n[39]It's really tiny, a grain of sand \n[40]\n[41]Can you handle that? \n[42]Thanks for letting me come. \n[43]I guess I'm already outvoted. \n[44]But you're flying Howland last, when you're exhausted. \n[45]Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland because it was my bright idea, and I'd feel responsible if... \n[46]I'd appreciate that. \n[47]You miss that island. You'll be out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go. \n[48]You and Fred alone for a month... \n[49]How do you feel? ", "AMELIA  (CONT'D)": "\n[1]I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever. \n[2]I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk. \n[3]Of course a gentleman. Would have paid for my ticket. \n[4]I don't think I've ever stopped listening. \n[5]I even had my own plane. Bought with my last dime. \n[6]Course in the early days of flying... \n[7]...crashing was so common, you almost forgot it could kill you... \n[8]...until it did. \n[9]Almost. \n[10]When he said it, I must have had a funny look. So I just said, `Yeh, I grew up around a guy like that.' \n[11]I thought he'd be a tyrant and that I would have to manage him. \n[12]Instead he was kind and generous. And only picked the fights he needed to win. \n[13]Of course, I knew all the stories \n[14]But I didn't kiss him because I felt sorry for him.

And give you that part of me you know and seem to want. \n[21]I closed the deal by choosing May 20, five years to the day from Lindbergh's flight. It was too good a sell for George to resist. \n[22]I was too busy to grasp how impossible the situation had become. The joke was... \n[23]All those months flying only with instruments, I should have been practicing without them. \n[24]I started to wonder if luck was paying me back. For thinking I knew the rules. \n[25]Then I smelled burning oil. \n[26]I told myself, push on. After all, if it was a stupid choice... \n[27]...no one would ever know. \n[28]With seemingly no warning, there was ice. The controls froze. \n[29]Through the spin I had one thought, it would be warmer lower, the ice would melt, I just had to regain control... \n[30]The ice happened twice more, and I began to lose heart. Then I remembered Lindbergh's book saying the same thing happened to him. \n[31]So I figured, if he's twice as good, I just have to be twice as lucky... \n[32]I'd read that part in George's reception room that first day.

There was a steady trickle of fuel down my neck. \n[34]Toss-up whether the bigger danger was running out of gas or going up in a fireball.

It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful. \n[13]Well, I think that's the most generous opportunity I've ever been offered. \n[14]In that case, I'll get my own plane and win the race myself. \n[15]That's a threat. \n[16]She's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around. \n[17]Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat.

Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club. \n[3]I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's 43rd mouse?     Or his 307th. \n[4]\n[5]This will never do, A.E., simply unacceptable. \n[6]And don't let anyone turn you around. \n[7]What could be wrong? I had such a lovely afternoon with Elinor Smith. \n[8]You didn't do this for business, anyway.   G \n[9]I might fly to Paris. \n[10]But you don't think that, do you, \n[11]The point is.

Make it. \n[16]We are on the line of position 157- 337, will repeat this message on 6210 kilocycles. Wait, listening north and south.

Then the men running the damn race suddenly decide every woman has to carry a male navigator, and start from east of the Rockies so they won't crash into the mountains! \n[4]I did it for fun? \n[5]Sure. \n[6]Listen, I've put together a month licensing deals, open new markets... \n[7]By this time, I had a side job as chairman of the editorial board of Paramount Pictures. So Amelia and I bought a little place in Los Angeles. \n[8]She was out there, preparing for a flight, when our home in Rye burned to the ground. \n[9]I found something you'd written. \n[10]`To touch your hand or see your face today is joy. Your casual presence in a room recalls the stars that watched us as we lay. \n[11]As I said, I've sort of persuaded Ed. There are a bunch of trustees and donors, tho. We have to get them on board. \n[12]Gene, this way our first leg is Oakland to Miami. It's a shakedown That's crucial. \n[13]And thanks for being here.

Which, perhaps, was even worse. \n[2]This was the moment of opportunity. Could we launch her into Lindbergh status as a permanent icon, before her name fell out of the news- papers. \n[3]We had separate agendas. For her, it was the advancement of aviation and of women. \n[4]As for me, I liked to tell myself it was about the money. Though there was never much of that left over. \n[5]Really, it was about the chance to be around her. \n[6]A gutsy gal who rode a bobsled in each morning on horseback, and carried a pistol on car trips. She possessed boundless energy, a towering intellect... \n[7]...and was Amelia's idol. As it happened, she was obsessed with flying, making Amelia her absolute heroine.

Too heavy, not important. \n[11]Then, suddenly our remaining radio frequencies. Pan Am hurriedly replaced the main antennae. And we thought all was well. \n[12]Its radio would be her lifeline. Its black plume of smoke would reach for miles. More visible than the island itself. \n[13]So I tortured myself. Why hadn't And then I realized... \n[14]It was the most tragic of endings.

Some guy named Lindbergh. \n[9]That handsome guy behind them isn't a movie star.
