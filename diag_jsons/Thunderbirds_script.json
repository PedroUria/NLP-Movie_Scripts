Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?  \n[7]Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission.  \n[8]Yeah!  Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel  \n[9]Come on, come on! Swing around. You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle.  \n[10]Come on, Dad.  A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2  \n[11]Probably drop the rescue platform from Thunderbird 2.  \n[12]Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow.  \n[13]Come on, Virgil.  \n[14]That's another good one, diaper boy.   All the boys look at the Know It All Kid and laugh  \n[15]Definitely!  \n[16]Just Fermat. \n[17]Lady Penelope, why are you in America? Are you on a mission for my father?   \n[18]Hi, Nosey.  \n[19]Okay, bring it on, big guy.  They are all in the car and Parker is driving away  \n[20]All right!  \n[21]\n[22]I wish that was me.  \n[23]Dad! \n[24]So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked dangerous.  \n[25]Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts? I mean that would explain the-- (Jeff cuts him off  \n[26]School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, maybe I could be home-educated now. That way, I could sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?  \n[27]Did you try readjust the flaps?  \n[28]Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat. Let's go.  \n[29]Ah, you worry too much.  \n[30]Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.

Run pre-flight checks.   \n[33]Commence main engine sequence.  \n[34]Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.   \n[35]Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys can't shut down Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse?  Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.   \n[36]I can't believe it.  \n[37]What is it?  \n[38]We gotta get out of here.  Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.  \n[39]Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to explain-  \n[40]But, nothing happened Dad. I had it under control.  \n[41]Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important!  \n[42]But, Dad!  \n[43]Then let me. (he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please!  Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings.  \n[44]Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. Don't panic.  The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to surface.  \n[45]On the other hand. \n[46]How'd they find the island? Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? Do you think I ruined everything?  \n[47]The vents. Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad.

Using an electronic device she finds out what type of door it is.  \n[49]Get in, get in.

On the other side of the door there is muffled banging from where Mullion is trying to break open the door.   \n[50]ahead.  \n[51]That's it.  \n[52]They've taken over.  \n[53]Who's the bald freak?  \n[54]Whoa.  \n[55]No, jump! We can get through to the silos.  The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the silos. And the scene switches to the Command and Control room.  \n[56]Hold on!  \n[57]This way. (They run toward the still closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.   \n[58]I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.   guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them  \n[59]You guys get the goons with the Firefly!  \n[60]Yeah.  \n[61]That's it. Time to thunderize. (After the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!   \n[62]Come on, let's go!  \n[63]Where's Fermat?  \n[64]Fermat!  \n[65]Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo) What were you doing back there,  Fermat?  \n[66]Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass code  \n[67]when you see them coming. (tries another pass code  Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see The Hood on the other side of the door. Alan turns back and sees him.  \n[68]go this way. He's there.  The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the other guards appear at the other doorway, leaving the children trapped.  \n[69]I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan looks at the control panel behind the Hood and sees a button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of his pants. and fires it at the button, but misses.  \n[70]It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires another rock and this time hits the button and the floor drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, and Alan scream as they fall.  \n[71]Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.   \n[72]You mean you can't swim?!  \n[73]I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch each other's backs. Nice drawers.  \n[74]No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.  \n[75]Right.  \n[76]Blow it up!  \n[77]Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand) Here's the plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road, here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?   \n[78]I'm in. (All three of them put their hands together) We gotta get up there fast! All our folks are in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island  \n[79]The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius. How'd you get this?  \n[80]I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.   \n[81]Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.  \n[82]I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?   \n[83]cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.  Scene change back to Lady Penelope's house.  \n[84]Blossoming?! What's that supposed to mean?  \n[85]You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. She's not that bad, I guess.  \n[86]What is it?  \n[87]Is that dangerous?  \n[88]So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.   Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it fall to the ground.  \n[89]Tintin, what was that?  \n[90]Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.  \n[91]Must run in the family. Did you do that?   \n[92]Still think everything can be explained by science?  \n[93]How we doing Fermat?  \n[94]Can you fix it?  \n[95]We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What?  Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's retainer.  \n[96]Ow!  \n[97]I'm gonna kill you.  \n[98]Dad?  \n[99]I'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack into the main computer system and give control of Thunderbird 5 back to you.   \n[100]Can you finish?  \n[101]Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay?  \n[102]Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll take care of everything, okay?  \n[103]Dad!  \n[104]Dad!  Alan throws the video phone  \n[105]Useless!  \n[106]No, it's okay. I'm fine.  \n[107]But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go. \n[108]Tintin, can you slow 'em down?  \n[109]Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat.  Scene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the junkyard.  \n[110]This'll get us out of here.  Scene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest.  \n[111]No problem.  \n[112]I said no problem.  \n[113]It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.  \n[114]Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught. I say we do something. Now! Right, Fermat?  \n[115]You don't think anything is s s-safe.   \n[116]Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote? Or do you want to get out of here? Cuz I'm going.  \n[117]I need more speed to get above the trees. Hang on!  Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's feet.  \n[118]What'd I tell you guys? (looks down and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) Oh, no.  Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door in the Tracy house.  \n[119]Lady P!  Scene switches to Thunderbird 5  \n[120]He's weak. Using his power makes him weak. (The Hood, having heard something looks over toward where Alan  \n[121]Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water  \n[122]be right all the time?  \n[123]I'm so sorry, Fermat. \n[124]We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting away.  \n[125]Yes!  \n[126]Okay, everyone get to the control room.   \n[127]How long have they got before re-entry?   \n[128]Good job, Fermat.  \n[129]Dad, come on are we coming through?   \n[130]Dad, come on!  \n[131]Dad!  \n[132]How long have they got?  \n[133]Dad!  \n[134]Dad, are you all right?  \n[135]He's got the Mole on board.  \n[136]Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything you've built everything the Thunderbirds stand for.  \n[137]I can do this. You know I can. What am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin and Fermat) We can do this.  \n[138]\n[139]Yep.  \n[140]You ready, Fermat?  \n[141]Right. Set primary fuel pumps. Main engine start.  \n[142]Roger, Brains.  \n[143]I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time.   \n[144]Initiate landing, Fermat.  \n[145]Retros at 75 flaps to 16.  \n[146]Thanks. Retros to 90.  Thunderbird 1 lands.  \n[147]The Hood's getting away.  \n[148]We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is to save those people. Brains, we're going into the accident zone.  \n[149]Brains, the monorail is down. Repeat, the monorail is down. I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4. You have the bridge.  \n[150]Fermat, the Thunderbirds need you right now. I need you.  \n[151]Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three, two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail.  People are panicking in the monorail and a little girl is crying for her mommy. \n[152]Don't panic, guys.   \n[153]Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it up?  \n[154]How are we doing on that line Fermat?   \n[155]Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. (Tintin successfully connects the rope to the stanchion and swims toward Thunderbird 4's airlock) Opening the airlock.   \n[156]OK, Fermat, we need a lift.  \n[157]That was amazing, Tintin.  \n[158]Nice job, Fermat.  \n[159]monorail out of the water with Thunderbird 4) Easy does it.  Thunderbird 3 has landed and Jeff, Scott, John, Virgil, and Gordon are running over to the river bank to look for Alan in Thunderbird 4.  \n[160]of Thunderbird 4) Glad you could finally join us. \n[161]Lady Penelope went after The Hood.   \n[162]Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said, about you leaving him to die. He was lying, right?  \n[163]What was Mom like?  \n[164]But what about The Hood? (Alan points behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When Parker turns away Alan runs after his dad.  \n[165]Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage door and reaches it right as it slams shut) Dad! Dad!  \n[166]Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.   \n[167]He's getting weaker. He can't last much longer.  \n[168]I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we do.  Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to a police car outside the Bank of London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.  \n[169]Good job, Ferm.  \n[170]Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, blossoming.  ", "FERMAT": "\n[1]Alan. Alan!  Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who is now standing in front of him.  \n[2]Alan!  Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them while walking by with the teacher from before  \n[3]You gotta be more careful Alan. \n[4]Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.  \n[5]Wanna watch?  \n[6]What do they do now?  \n[7]Commencing reverse thrust.  \n[8]Sure beats the bus!  \n[9]Hi, Parker.  \n[10]Whoa!  \n[11]Yeah! the boys high five  \n[12]But!

Hydraulic systems are green.   \n[16]FAB, Alan.  \n[17]No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird 1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) Wrong switch!   \n[18]It just did. The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the silo door. Fermat is running his hand on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1. \n[19]We're so b-b-busted.  Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 1 earlier.  \n[20]Look at this.  \n[21]Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound.  \n[22]Morning, Dad.  \n[23]The neural-net control system?  \n[24]Dad?  The neural-net control system short circuits.  \n[25]There's something I want to talk to you about.  \n[26]N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.  \n[27]That'd be g-g-g-swell! Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera follows one rock and it leads to a telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected to the Hood's submarine.  \n[28]Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit!  \n[29]No! That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.   \n[30]My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?  \n[31]Watch out for the guards.  \n[32]Okay, this one.  Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.  \n[33]They've got m-my dad.  \n[34]Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was him that sneezed.  \n[35]murder with my allergies.

The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo just as it closes.  \n[37]get through it) No!  \n[38]If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel. But we need a plan, Alan.  \n[39]Alan! This equipment is only to be used in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give him looks) I guess this qualifies.  \n[40]Uh, no.  \n[41]I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum.  \n[42]Coming!  \n[43]I had an-n-n idea.  \n[44]No!  Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan?  \n[45]How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?  \n[46]I could have drowned.  \n[47]I repeat, I could have drowned.  Scene switches to the boys ringing out their shirts, they are both in their boxers.  \n[48]Thank you.  \n[49]Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right?  \n[50]So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could  \n[51]No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.  \n[52]But that's f-f- off limits. \n[53]Actually, he's not going anywhere for now.  \n[54]Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.  Scene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, where Parker is out cleaning a car when the car phone rings.  \n[55]What do you mean, Alan?  \n[56]Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science.  \n[57]My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin! Can we s-s-  \n[58]Yes!  \n[59]\n[60]Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?   \n[61]Come on, Alan.

Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then an explosion near Scott and Gordon.  \n[68]Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. Which is now b-b-broken.  \n[69]Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.  \n[70]Perfect.  \n[71]What'd he say?  \n[72]I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 5.  Scene switch to Thunderbird 5  \n[73]Okay, we're almost there.  Scene switches to Command and Control room with Transom and Brains.   \n[74]They're onto us! We're being jammed!   \n[75]I'll try.  \n[76]It's not going to work Alan. The signal's too weak for data transmission.  \n[77]No!  \n[78]It is now.  \n[79]You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.   \n[80]Even worse, they know exactly  Tires screech and Mullion and the guards appear.  \n[81]Where we are! Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second.  \n[82]Great, more water.  \n[83]It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.  \n[84]You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else  \n[85]It's a hoversled.  \n[86]Here. \n[87]Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-s-safe.  \n[88]Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team.  \n[89]Alan! You're going too fast!  \n[90]Oh, no! Not the fridge!  Fridge door opens to reveal Kyrano, Onaha, and Brains.  \n[91]Not b-bad, actually.  \n[92]We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen.  \n[93]Quick! They're getting away  \n[94]Scene switches to everyone running into the Command and Control room  \n[95]Get in there quick, Fermat, and save my family. Then we'll get The Hood. Good luck!   \n[96]Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes.  \n[97]90 seconds and counting   \n[98]I'm in! \n[99]Okay, I just need someone on their end to confirm the access protocol.'  \n[100]45 seconds until re-entry.  \n[101]Mr. Tracy, confirm access protocol.   \n[102]N-n- I guess!

We're going to maximum thrust.   \n[106]Right.   \n[107]\n[108]You're going too fast.  \n[109]What are we gonna do, Alan?  \n[110]Me?! Fly alone?!  \n[111]Scene switches to Thunderbird 3 flying to London.  \n[112]I can't get a clear fix on the target. I might hit the passengers.  \n[113]What you mean swim?!  \n[114]Just look out your window.  \n[115]Come on, Tintin, come on!  \n[116]FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust.   \n[117]Nothing to it, really.  \n[118]Look out, Parker!  \n[119]Parker, can we wrap this up?  \n[120]Strategically speaking, the best odds of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.  \n[121]Mr. Tracy!

I am starved.   \n[17]Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.  \n[18]Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school.  \n[19]No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?   \n[20]Okay, that's enough.

I didn't see that one coming.  \n[29]Have a safe flight home, Penny.  \n[30]1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 1 shuts down  \n[31]You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!  \n[32]Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules. You understand? (Alan just looks at him) Do you?  \n[33]I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.  \n[34]Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.  \n[35]Hey, John.

You all right?  \n[59]You don't say.  Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and Fermat.  \n[60]Alan, where are you? Are you safe?   \n[61]We're standing by.  \n[62]happening?  \n[63]That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point. Alan can you read me? (the screen begins to break up  \n[64]Alan we're losing you! Alan!  \n[65]Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's getting a little hot in here.  \n[66]Stop it!  \n[67]No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.  \n[68]He's a Tracy.  Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and then to Lady Penelope and Parker walking up to the Tracy house  \n[69]Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open.  Scene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and Parker.  \n[70]I think that's the first time you've ever called me by my first name, Brains. Thanks for waking me.  \n[71]Alan! Well done.  \n[72]FAB, Brains.   \n[73]Looks like we're good to go.  \n[74]We're fine. We still have a job to do. Where's The Hood? \n[75]Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.   \n[76]Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. Thunderbirds are go!  \n[77]boys, we are outta here.  \n[78]Gordon, heat 'em up.  Thunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes panic.  \n[79]Ride it out, boys! Scene changes to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat in Thunderbird 2.   \n[80]Brains, come in, what's the situation?   \n[81]Where's Thunderbird 1?  \n[82]FAB. We're right behind 'em.  Scene changes to Mullion, Transom, and the Hood in the Bank of London.  \n[83]Hey don't get cocky after one mission. We still have a dangerous situation. I need you boys to close down this accident scene. Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us at Thunderbird 1. Alan, you come with me.  \n[84]We got to get to the Bank of London fast.  \n[85]I know, she may need help.  Scene changes to The Hood inspecting a diamond at the Bank of London.  \n[86]No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan. It doesn't matter how hard you try or how brave you are. It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give your life in a second to save. You just can't save everyone.  \n[87]She was a lot like you. Come on, we've got a job to do.  Scene switches to Lady Penelope being handcuffed at the Bank of London.  \n[88]Good timing, Parker.  \n[89]Come with us.  \n[90]Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.  \n[91]Penny!  \n[92]I didn't make you what you are.  \n[93]Leave my son out of this- (the Hood uses his powers to throw Jeff into the cage that Lady Penelope is handcuffed in  \n[94]No!  \n[95]Alan!  The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the catwalk above the Mole. The scene then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into a cage.  \n[96]Alan, stay back. \n[97]Let him go.  \n[98]Let him go, please.  \n[99]Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens his hold of Alan and then releases him   \n[100]Alan, get out. Run!  \n[101]Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, no! Look out! (The Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!  \n[102]It's a Tracy secret.  \n[103]I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special night. We're all together because of three very special people. Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them International Rescue pins  \n[104]Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. You earned it. You all did.  \n[105]Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, straightaway. Boys. Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.  \n[106]Thunderbirds are go! Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat   ", "LADY PENELOPE": "\n[1]Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?  All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose them. \n[2]Quite right.  \n[3]Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to Lady Penelope's pink car with Parker, her butler waiting by the open door.) Here we are.  \n[4]Try not to run over any children, Parker.   \n[5]Come on, Parker, chop chop!  Lady Penelope's begins to fly  \n[6]Pink is the new black this season.   \n[7]And hemlines are going up.  \n[8]Oh and apparently England won the football last night.  \n[9]Calm down, Parker.  \n[10]Now, that's showing off.  \n[11]Scene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo.  \n[12]I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.  \n[13]Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.   \n[14]My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.   \n[15]Hello, Tintin.  \n[16]When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of thing.  \n[17]\n[18]No, you wouldn't.  \n[19]Thanks, Jeff.  Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 1 like they are really about to fly it into a mission.  \n[20]Parker?  \n[21]We have an emergency.  Scene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom  \n[22]What a charming fellow.  Someone knocks on the door.  \n[23]Come in.  Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is up to her shoulders in bubble bath.  \n[24]Have a look at this, Parker. (There is a computer monitor near her feet.) He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.   \n[25]Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when  his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. Oh, perfect, Parker. The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. Belagant's brother.  \n[26]How's my schedule, Parker?  \n[27]I suppose that's urgent.  \n[28]The Thunderbirds haven't responded?   \n[29]I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker.  \n[30]Any word?  \n[31]Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We  shall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And bring the car around.  \n[32]The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go, Parker.  They get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood in the Thunderbirds hanger.  \n[33]Isn't life fun, sometimes?  \n[34]This doesn't look good, Parker.  \n[35]That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about  that hideous hammock. \n[36]And I know Parker.  \n[37]One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level. sometimes it's just not possible.  Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching them.  \n[38]Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.  \n[39]Flattery will get you nowhere. (after she blocks the metal bar that Transom was trying to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days?  \n[40]That's not saying much, then, is it?  \n[41]Don't try your parlor games on me you sad, little man. You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's watch) four seconds, I'm going to get quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot which was about to come up and kick him.  \n[42]Put me down! This outfit is couture.   Scene switches to Thunderbird 5.  \n[43]closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite enough losing for one day.  \n[44]Parker, I have an idea.  \n[45]Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?  \n[46]Here we go.  \n[47]on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys a good thrashing!  Scene switches back to Thunderbird 2 launching Stage three.  Scene changes back to the fridge.  \n[48]I love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker.  \n[49]Will this suffice, Parker?  \n[50]I didn't actually need it, anyway.   \n[51]Thunderbird 5) Thunderbird 5 come in.  Thunderbird 5 come in.  \n[52]Thunderbird 5 come in.  \n[53]London.  \n[54]toys? Complete.  \n[55]And off we go!  Scene switches to Thunderbird 2 entering London.  \n[56]Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.  \n[57]Let's get her down, boys.  \n[58]Textbook, boys.  Scene switches to the Mole  \n[59]Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.   \n[60]Don't be rude. I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull this big trigger. Now, don't move!  \n[61]That's not cricket.  \n[62]How ghastly.  Scene changes to Alan and Jeff in Thunderbird 1.  \n[63]Shame on you. I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs. (sees the look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles and walks away.  Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter the Bank of London when Parker pulls up. \n[64]Jeff!  \n[65]Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to throw Alan off to the side where he slams into a wall  \n[66]Let him go.  \n[67]Alan! Are you all right?  \n[68]margaritas?  \n[69]Of course it does. And quite right too.   Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms about to go on a rescue mission. The older four are looking at Alan.  \n[70]Fast as you can, Parker.  ", "THE HOOD": "\n[1]Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals, they return to Olympus. And so I follow.  \n[2]Transom, I need you.  \n[3]Mullion.  \n[4]Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine? One of the principle tenets of Eastern martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.   The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place  \n[5]It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island. On the other hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.  The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls over.  \n[6]The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. All we need do is give them the victim. (The Hood looks at Transom) Commence targeting.  \n[7]Fire.  Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5.  Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms start to go off around him.   \n[8]There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers?  Scene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 3 launching and heading toward Thunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well.   \n[9]\n[10]So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff Tracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident? Avalanche wasn't it? How tragic.  Scene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the Command and Control room.  \n[11]Transom, concentrate!  \n[12]Professor. Please. Activate the control switch.  \n[13]Professor, you and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is, I was born with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely touched the surface. (Brains is forced to stand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds can be broken. It would be a pity to break yours.  \n[14]Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses his powers to make BRAINS move) Like a puppet on a string!  Brains hand touches the activation pad.   \n[15]Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can see I have taken over your facilities. You no longer control your operational systems.  Scene change back to the kids in the vent. They can stick their heads out of the vent and see into the Command and Control Room, but they are hidden behind a panel and the Hood and his minions cannot see them.  \n[16]Warm them up, Transom.  \n[17]Oh how rude of me. You can call me The Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't be negotiating. I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world, starting with the Bank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible. \n[18]An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.  \n[19]Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother,  Kyrano?  \n[20]them away.  \n[21]You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body but you've no idea how powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with Thunderbird 5.  \n[22]Apparently, the island is not as secure as you thought. (he looks at the old photos that were on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?  \n[23]\n[24]Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps you already suspected that about your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do you suppose it was guilt? Because he let your mother die.  Open the door, Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries to use his powers on Alan but nothing happens  \n[25]It's not me you're angry at, Alan.   \n[26]Get them!  \n[27]Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. This is taking too long. Pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2. No more delays.  \n[28]Subtle, as usual, Mullion.  \n[29]Don't worry. You'll get your money.   \n[30]Clever Alan. It's the children. They have it. \n[31]I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. And make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper.  Scene switches to the children in the jungle.  \n[32]And give Mullion the coordinates.  Scene switches to Mullion and the two guards in a car. Transom is communicating with him through his headset.  \n[33]What is it?  \n[34]Whom do we have here? Mullion.  \n[35]Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has his palace. Why not his princess?   \n[36]You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. More than a match for most men.  \n[37]Parker was about to throw at him) I suggest you let us pass.  \n[38]you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain again You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out again) You have something that belongs to me.  \n[39]You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that.  Put them with the others.  \n[40]What is our ETA?  \n[41]Set a course for the vault.  \n[42]Stay on course.  \n[43]No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.   The Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail car stranded in the air. Scene then switches to Thunderbird 1  \n[44]Stay focused, Mullion. Nine more banks to go.  Scene changes to Alan in Thunderbird 4.  \n[45]Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds. Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise.   \n[46]Mullion. (uses his powers to knock the gun from Lady Penelope's hand  \n[47]I'm sorry. The only part of sport I ever liked was winning.  \n[48]Finish her off, Mullion.  \n[49]The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill them all.  Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside the Bank of London.  \n[50]Did you save them all this time, Jeff? Or did you leave someone behind?  \n[51]It's not me you have to convince. (motions his head toward the entrance of the room where Alan is standing  \n[52]I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought we were kindred spirits.  \n[53]\n[54]You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps. (uses his powers to lift Alan off the floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands   \n[55]Did you really think you could challenge me?  \n[56]I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands until he cries in pain and lets go  \n[57]Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room  \n[58]Ah,  (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh!  (The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood dangling above the still active Mole.  \n[59]Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases one hand from the railing) Like your father did.  \n[60]See you soon, Jeff.  ", "TINTIN": "\n[1]Hey, Mr. Tracy.  \n[2]Good evening, Lady Penelope.  \n[3]one) I mean, oh, Alan's back!  Hey, Dad.  \n[4]We have to do something.  \n[5]Scene switches back to Command and Control room.  \n[6]Dad!  \n[7]That makes The Hood my uncle?  \n[8]Run! Run!  \n[9]The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon   \n[10]They've got us trapped. What now?  \n[11]Here they come. Fermat, can you drive this thing?  \n[12]Hey, watch it!  \n[13]Got it.  \n[14]Let's move it.  \n[15]Fermat!  \n[16]That's your idea?  \n[17]Boo!  \n[18]You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. Those are nice drawers!  Scene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches.   \n[19]Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go through the jungle.  \n[20]It's gonna be dangerous.  \n[21]Stop?  \n[22]No!  \n[23]guys, take five.  \n[24]Guys?  Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.  \n[25]Don't move.  \n[26]Hexdrotilous scorpion.  \n[27]Let's get going. \n[28]Just drop it, okay?  \n[29]Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby. \n[30]I think it was some sort of apology.   \n[31]I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us.  \n[32]I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.  \n[33]I'd be delighted.  \n[34]Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here. What is this?  \n[35]Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said.  \n[36]You can be a real jerk sometimes.  Scene changes to Mullion looking up and seeing the kids escaping on the hoversled.  \n[37]Mullion and the other guards in the car getting closer to them) Oh, no!  \n[38]What are you doing?  \n[39]I'm fine, Dad.  \n[40]Lady Penelope!  \n[41]Are we really going?  \n[42]Oh, boy!  \n[43]Those people can't hold on much longer.   \n[44]I'll go and fix it myself.  \n[45]Get me as close as you can.  \n[46]Thank you.  \n[47]Allow me.

And radar indicates we have some company.  Thunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan turns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll around Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind.  \n[9]Milady?  \n[10]Sounds like an alias, milady.  \n[11]Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.  \n[12]You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.  \n[13]Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta.  \n[14]No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis-\u00e0-vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on the news.  \n[15]I fear you're not wrong, milady.  \n[16]Nothing, milady.  \n[17]Yes, milady.  \n[18]Tracy Island approaching, milady.

An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2.  \n[17]What's going on?   \n[18]What's wrong with it?  \n[19]Aaargh!  \n[20]No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.  \n[21]Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.   Scene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter.  \n[22]Come on!
