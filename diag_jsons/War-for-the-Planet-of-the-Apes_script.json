You too, soldier. \n[23]\n[24]...Ok.   Back to work. \n[25]Please.    Tell them to work. \n[26]Tell them. \n[27]Five...    Four... \n[28]Three...   Two... \n[29]String him up, donkey. \n[30]Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall. \n[31]They'll get food and water when they finish the work. \n[32]You know you're very emotional. What makes you think you're in a position to make demands? \n[33]I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive. \n[34]No.   They won't be joining me. \n[35]They... fear me. \n[36]Jesus Christ... you are impressive. \n[37]Well, you paint quite a picture.     What you must think of me. \n[38]You came here to kill me.   Were you going to show me mercy? \n[39]Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us? \n[40]You're much stronger than we are. And you're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us, that's the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now. \n[41]Ten months ago, we sent out recon units to look for your base. They found nothing. My own son was a soldier with one of the groups. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became... primitive. Like an animal. They contacted me, said they thought he lost his mind, that the war was too much for him. But then the man caring for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking. That the virus that almost wiped us out -- the virus every human survivor still carries \u00ad- had suddenly changed... Mutated. \n[42]And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts... not unlike what you all used to be. You talk about mercy...? What would you have done? \n[43]Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child. He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear. \n[44]I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might've been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too. Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That's when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past. \n[45]What did I do, Preacher? \n[46]Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves. \n[47]This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain. This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we'll become your cattle. \n[48]Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't you. \n[49]Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you. \n[50]I didn't mean to kill your son... \n[51]But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... then I'm glad I did. \n[52]So emotional! \n[53]I can see how conflicted you are. You're confused in your purpose. You're angry at me because of something I did that was an act of war. But you're taking this all much too personally. \n[54]What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me? \n[55]Or is killing me more important...? \n[56]If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him. Keep him separate from the others. \n[57]How many are out there?   Are there others? \n[58]Sweep the area. Put him in the pen. \n[59]For two years we've fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we've been waging all this time is against ourselves. \n[60]They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world. \n[61]Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they'll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...? And you can tell them, you fought... viciously... for a gentler world. \n[62]Send him up to the quarry.    Alone. \n[63]Boyle!   His cuffs. \n[64]What is this...? \n[65]How did this get in there? \n[66]Get him to work. \n[67]Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor. \n[68]You apes are so strong... I wonder... what kind of world you would have built... on our graves. \n[69]You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together. \n[70]I think that was his name, yes. \n[71]He said you were remarkable.   More than just an animal... \n[72]you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant. He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you. \n[73]I shot him. \n[74]What's going on here? ", "BAD APE": "\n[1]Cold...? \n[2]Cold. \n[3]I see girl.
