{"dialogues": {"RAMIUS": "\n[1]It is cold. And hard. Turning his back on the icy coast, Ramius smi-I fondly at the man who just spoke to him \n[2]e your head a bit. No need to crowd him. \n[3]\n[4]Quiet as grass, Vastly. Quiet as grass.  Good morning, Comrade political off=er \n[5]You know he was. \n[6]We go. \n[7]in Red October's Conn. Much larger than the control center on the Dallas. Leaving the deck, Ramius heads aft, glancing at Borodin: \n[8]When you see Putin, tell him that when it's convenient, 191 be in my stateroom. Leaving the Conn, Ramius enters \n[9]What are you doing? \n[10]And you accomplish this by searching through my papers and invading my privacy? \n[11]The book belonged to my wife. I keep it only for sentimental value. \n[12]I assure you, Comrade. There's nothing wrong with my mind. \n[13]How many more agents does the KGB have on my boat? \n[14]I suggest we open our orders. \n[15]We are to proceed to grid 54-90 and rendezvous with the Akula submarine, Konovalov. \n[16]You know Tupolav? \n[17]There is no room in Tupolev's heart for anyone or anything except Tupolev. Having made contact, we are ordered to run a series of drfl1 . Tupolev w2l hunt us while we test our ship. Putting down his tea, Putin stands, suddenly formal, awkwardly \n[18]Before you do, I want to talk to you about something important. \n[19]As you wash, Comrade. Putin grins, heading for the door. He never makes it. In a sudden violent motion,, Ramius kicks Putin's left leg from under him. Surprised, the; big man tumbles sideways. Leaping to his feet, Ramius catches Putin, slamming him into a headlock, driving his thick neck downward, CRACKING his SKULL in the SHARP corner of the DESK. Putin gags. Cupping his chin, Ramius forces his entire bulk onto the man's chest. Putin struggles. His eyes bulge. Ramius strains, using all of his strength until.. \n[20]I an sorry my friend. But it is cyear to me now. Where I would walk, you cannot fallow. Whatever his destination, Putin's on his way. Getting up, Ramius goes to the desk. Returning with the teapot, he drenches the body with scalding tea. Replacing the pot on the tray, Ramius puts the orders in a wastebasket and sets them on are. Removing a duplicate set of orders from his safe, he' places them on the floor by the dead man. Satisfied everything is the way he wants it, he moves to an intercom and takes a deep breath. Pushing a button, he BELLOWS: \n[21]Dr. Petrov. Come to my quarters at once. There's been an aociderit! \n[22]If I hadn't spilled the tea, Putin might never have slipped and --- \n[23]We will not. \n[24]For many years the Russian Navy went to sea before there were political offScers, Doctor. \n[25]These orders are quite specific. Putin's unfortunate death wall not change them. Turning, Ramius spots Loginov and waves his hand. Loginov freezes. \n[26]You. Come here. Your name? \n[27]Good. Now, I want you and the Doctor to witness this, Ioginov. I have removed Putin's missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f. Iognov blinks. Petrov frowns. Closing the freezer door, the sates ]save. Loginov isn't sure what to do. Petrov's agitated: \n[28]From what, Doctor? \n[29]Impossible. We are ordered to maintain strict radio silence. That will be all, Comrade. Glad to be anywhere else, Loginov returns to his work. \n[30]I suggest you return to sick bay, Doctor. Soon, I will address the crew and explain our orders. This is not a decision for discussion. Shrugging, Petrov disappears. Borodin and Ramius.. follow him. Freaked, Loginov watches them go. \n[31]Down scope. Any. sonar contacts? \n[32]All right. rm going to address the crew. Ramius grabs the whip telephone. Jaw set, his eyes blaze with \n[33]Comrades, here are our orders given to us by Red Fleet Command. it is our good fortune to make the first test of our revolutionary propulsion system. In various locations all over the ship, sailors stop what they are doing and listen carefully: \n[34]We are to pass quiet as water through every one of the American's sonar nets. Maintaining strict radio. silence, we are to proceed across the Atlantic to the east coast of the United States. \n[35]Once in the home waters of the enemy, we are to conduct a series of ine firing tests, targeting major cities on the enemy's eastern seaboard. \n[36]For many years, we have had to stand helplessly in the wings while poll ns compromise every advance our military has made. \n[37]it is politicians who have crippled our armed forces while talking incessantly of peace. And now it is time, comrades, to exchange the cuckoo for a hawk. \n[38]Our missies will not be armed, of course, but imagine, if they were. In one bright moment, all that we believe in, all that we honor, would prevail forever. Ramius is finished. No one moves. Kamarov has goose bumps. \n[39]Comrade, navigator. \n[40]Rig for silent running. \n[41]Engage the caterpi lar. \n[42]on the deck by the phone in Red October's Conn. Conscious of all eyes on him, he turns to a HELMSMAN: \n[43]Left full rudder. \n[44]Navigator, make your new course two-five-zero. \n[45]Sonar. Is the American turning to Ballow us? \n[46]He can't hear us. Silence, Impulsively, Kamarov starts HUMMING the INTERNATIONALE. Of cers and enlisted men join in. It snowballs. One at a time, the crew RAISE their VOICES \n[47]at the head of a table in Red October's wardroom, Borodin to his left. Seven officers sit or stand to the side. Beside Borodin \n[48]No, Vlktor. Visibly shaken, Stadnyuk waves his hands: \n[49]There is no way we could have accomplished our task with Putin aboard. He would have stopped us. \n[50]Enough! Putin is dead. The responsibility and the guilt are mine. There's something else you should know. On the morning we sailed, I posted a letter to Admiral Padorin announcing our intentions to defect. Borodin's jaw drops. Tbilisi. is speechless. Kamarov whispers: \n[51]We needed to burn the bridges. Make a clean break. \n[52]How many times have you served in my command, Viktrxr? \n[53]Do you know me to be a man who talerates insubordination? Tbili- blanches, but will not look away. Ramius glances at the \n[54]Return to your posts. All of You. No one moves. Time crawls by. Finally, Borodin gets to his feet: \n[55]Our original orders were to demonstrate that this ship cannot be found. That is precisely what we will do. \n[56]What is It? \n[57]\n[58]How long before you can fix it? \n[59]We're going to have to run an normal propuLainn. Can you get the reactor up? \n[60]That will be all, Doctor. Frightened, Petrov, stares at Ramb, The Captain's indomitable. Petrov leaves. Borodin has concerns of his own: \n[61]Pray that we aren't, Vasily. \n[62]in Red October's Conn, talking in hushed tones with Melekhin and Borodin. Oblivious to their conversation, the crew moves about in the background. \n[63]What do you mean, \u00e2\u0080\u009e you stall, don't know? \n[64]Put it on audio. SONAR on AUDIO. Ramius glances at Borodin. Ashen, Borodin puts down a clipboard. At his quartermaster station, Stadnyuk upends, a mess of pencils. \n[65]All stop! We have just run out of time, Comrade. Get us out of this mess. And hurry! Quartermaster, sounding? Dammit, Ivan. Give me a sounding! \n[66]Torpedo room, this is the Captain. Prepare to launch a counter-measure. Ramins and Borodin exchange glances. At his quartermaster station, Stadnyuk is paralyzed with fear. \n[67]Torpedo room, this is the Captain. Launch counter-measure. The Conn SHUDDERS. Metal GRINDS. Within moments, a second PINGING Is added to that of the TORPEDO on AUDIO. \n[68]Bottom the ship. \n[69]You're relieved of your duties, Ivan! Return to your quarters. Now! Amplified PINGS. Torpedo's getting CLOSER. The counter-measure is MOVING AWAY. Waiting until. Stadnyuk has gone, Ramius turns to the Kamarov: \n[70]Bottom the damn ship! \n[71]This Is the Captain. The explosion you Just heard was the first operational test of a new counter-measure. The torpedo was launched by our friends in Soviet aviation. Borodin stares at Ramius: \n[72]Until now, orders required that I keep this aspect of our mission secret so that you might be evaluated under simulated battle conditions. Pump us off the bottom and engage the c\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtaerpa'T]ar. Nobody moves. Ramius is indomitable: \n[73]Diving officer, bring the ship to one hundred meters. \n[74]\n[75]We21. have to find a way to get the crew off this ship, now. We are in danger every second they are aboard. \n[76]in the Conn on Red October, surrounded by activity. Urgently, he speaks into a mike: \n[77]Sonar, this is Ramius. Can you identify the contact? \n[78]as before in Red. October's -Conn. The crew has come to battle stations. Borodin is at fire control.. \n[79]Prepare tubes three and four and plot a solution. \n[80]No. Lock the (ring solution into computer. Do not flood the tubes. \n[81]Weapons status? \n[82]Verify the range one more time. \n[83]Give me a sounding, ' Vasily! Ping once only. Borodin goes to work. Ramius stares at Melekhin. Melekhin frowns. What the hell is happening? \n[84]I think they w91 let you live wherever you want, my find. \n[85]I said, keep your voice down. The \n[86]it's probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes. That happens. Now let's take' another sample. But quietly. We don't want to panic the crew. \n[87]Evacuate the compartment-' Technicians scramble for the door. Searing hot steam chokes the compartment. Melekhin SCREAMS: \n[88]Get us to periscope depth.We ]i ventilate! \n[89]Alright. Pass word to abandon ship. Draft a message to Red Fleet Command telling them our location and situation! \n[90]All right. Instruct the crew to secure the rafts to the deck. When all. personnel are aboard the rafts, we will scuttle the ship out from under us! \n[91]Do you have a count? Have they all been evacuated? \n[92]Can you classify it? \n[93]There's only one thing we can do. Go topside and take care of the crew. I and my officers wall submerge the ship and take her elsewhere to scuttle. The Americans must never have this boat! All Petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat. At the door, Ramius stops him: \n[94]Doctor. When you get home. You will. hear many stories about me and some are true. But tell them that in the end I did my duty. Petrov splits. Borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it. \n[95]Submerge the ship. \n[96]Gentlemen, I am Marko Ramius. I and my offers request political asylum in the United States. Before I go any further, I want to know whose idea is this impos.ih18 plan? \n[97]Amazing. our intention was to publicly surrender this boat and request asylum. it never occurred to us there would be a way you could keep it. The idea to stage a radiation leak was inspired -- You look familiar. Do I know you, Commander? \n[98]\n[99]Get back to engineering and give me some power! \n[100]No, Vasily. I need you in fire control. We must track whoever's out there. Borodin heads for fre control. Ramius tosses Ryan into the chair behind the helm : \n[101]You sit here! \n[102]Do exactly as I tell you! Stunned, Ryan grabs the helm. Jones and Tbilisi, must have made it to sonar. Speakers CRACKLE: \n[103]All ahead flank! \n[104]Turn the helm to the heft. Steer course zero-two-zero. \n[105]Turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero-two-zero. \n[106]I know. \n[107]Me]ekhin. Can you give me any more speed? \n[108]What books? \n[109]What books did you write? \n[110]I know this book. I have read some parts of it. Your conclusions were wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly. CRASH. The Conn ROCKS. Sound of TORPEDO BREAKING UP. Metal SCRAPES along the SHIP. Realizing what's going on: \n[111]Not yet. Right now, the Soviet Captain, a man named Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons. He won't make the same mistake twice. Behind Ramius, Ryan spots a SHADOW at the rear of the Conn. He can't believe his eyes. The goddam shadow has a pistol in hand. \n[112]The ship is yours. \n[113]Then get behind him and stay there. Don't let him put you in his sights or we're all dead. Mancuso tosses Ramius his .45. Catching it, Ramius splits. Ryan follows. \n[114]He'll break into a panel and short -circuit the wiring on a missile. We'll be blown to pieces. Taking a deep breath, Ryan follows Ramiais into the \n[115]We must stop him before he gets into a panel.. Ryan stares at Ramius. Ramiii isn't gonna stop anybody. Resigned, Ryan finds the .45 Mancuso gave him in his pocket, \n[116]Be careful what you shoot at in here, Ryan. The compartment is very sensitive. In a daze, Ryan starts walking aft, still MUMBLING: \n[117]Captain Tupalev has just provided your pantomime with the one thing you could never have managed. \n[118]Interesting notion, hiding a submarine in a river. How do you know this place? \n[119]There is one question you have not asked me. \n[120]We. are standing on part of the reason. I've spent my life preparing to fight a war I hoped would never happen. This ship was not built to fight such a war. it was built to start one. And there were personal reasons. \n[121]it started there, perhaps. Ramius glances at the rock. Beside it, a muskrat drops quietly into the water. \n[122]Or perhaps it was something that started long ago... \n[123]\"The sea will, grant each man new hope, as sleep doth dream of home.\"  Christopher Columbus. Ryan smilm. ", "RYAN": "\n[1]Hey.., What are you doing up? You're suppose to be sleeping. \n[2]What's the matter? \n[3]I have to go on a business trip and you have to go to sleep or when you grow up you'll only be two inches tall. \n[4]What's the matter, Stanley? Are you nuts or something? \n[5]Just a minute. - Daddy has to go, cricket. You and Stanley go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler and go straight to sleep. When I'm away, I'll see if I can find Stanley a brother. \n[6]\n[7]I'm all wet. \n[8]I'm gonna miss you. \n[9]Won't do me any good --- \n[10]OK. I ll try. Taking the pil3s, he kisses her again. All of a sudden, he wants to climb inside, park someplace and steam the windows. Her smile is \n[11]Hey.. If I'm lucky, might miss the damn plane altogether. \n[12]I'm fine. Thank you. \n[13]Turbulence. You know. When solar radiation heats the earth's crust. Warm air rises. Cool air descends. Turbulence. I don't like it. \n[14]No. I just read a lot of books. \n[15]humping his suitcase into a giant terminal at the end of a long line of travelers. Above the line, a sign: \n[16]Thanks, Admiral. \n[17]I think I need ooffiae. Ryan perches on the couch. Greer pours Ryan takes it in both hands, coaling it with his breath. \n[18]Don't know. This thing is still on London time. \n[19]Fine. She sends you her best. \n[20]A very precocious five. A week ago she announced her life would be a loot less lonely if Margaret and I would buy her a baby brother. \n[21]British Intelligence received these two days ago. She's the Red October. The Soviet's newest typhoon. \n[22]\n[23]Twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon, three meters wider. The captain's name is Ramixts. \n[24]Yes, sir. I did the bio on him last year. He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years. Fairly good political connections. He's also trained most of their attack boat skippers. They can him the Vilnius schoolmaster. Greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass. Something captures his attention: \n[25]The doors, Admiral, are the problem. I don't know what they are and neither do the English. it's just pole our friends at the Ustinov Design Bureau have come up with something new. With your permission, I'd like to show these to someone. Do you know Skip Tyler? \n[26]He was Captain on an attack boat. Got clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg. Now he's teaching at the Academy and doing some consulting for Underwater Systems Command. \n[27]Right now if it's OX with you? 've. never met him personally, but - \n[28]They shouldn't have been sea ready for weeks. Ryan closes his case. Greer walks him to the door: \n[29]Well, In that case -- Can you tell me where I can buy a bear? \n[30]Yes sir.  What it that thing? \n[31]That's what a DSRV looks like. \n[32]What are you doing with it? Tyler climbs off the piatfarm, working his cane with practiced precision. Taking Ryan by the arm, he heads for a door: \n[33]You don't miss much, do you? They're too big for torpedo tubes. Could you launch a missile horizontaly? \n[34]How about a towed sonar array? \n[35]A what? \n[36]Oh sure. \n[37]\n[38]it put to sea this morning. \n[39]Any records of our work on the caterpillar? \n[40]Yes? No, this is Dr. Ryan. Affright. He stares at Tyler quizzically, waiting: \n[41]Yes, Admiral, I'm --- \n[42]Yes, sir, but what's - \n[43]I got a line on the doors. You know what they are? Greer doesn't answer. Impatient, Ryan follows him into \n[44]How did -? \n[45]Jesus... ! This is unbelievable. The Kirov, too. They've sortled their whale bloody fleet! \n[46]Where're we going anyway? \n[47]Who's giving the brieefing? \n[48]\n[49]Gentlemen, the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity. The first to sail was -- this ship, the Red October. A variant of the typhoon class, she's some six hundred fifty feet long. Thirty-two thousand tons submerged displacement, roughly the size of a World War II aircraft Carrier. Unlike the standard typhoon, equipped to fire long-range missiles from Russian waters, Red October carries fifty-six SS-311s, which is a short-range attack mis it with eight independent warheads. That's four hundred forty-eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in. We believe these doors on the bow, and here again on the stern, enclose a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar, which may allow the sub to run totally silent. it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain, a man named Marko \n[50]to elude one of ' our attack boats, the Dallas, which trailed Red October f r om harbor this morning. This drive, if it's working, could render Red October invvsihl8 to our SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic. \n[51]There's no doubt about that, sir. She is designed to approach by stealth, and fire on a target with little or no warning. \n[52]Precisely, Admiral.. if I may continue. Shortly after the Dallas lost contact, there were additional Soviet mailings from Pa tjarny, Leningrad and the Mediterranean. The Soviets have \n[53]That's her uncle! \n[54]Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle! Greer has no idea what Ryan's saying. Moore's still talking: \n[55]This is the twenty-gird, isn't it? Greer nods. Order in the room has broken down. Generals and Admirals argue vehemently about appropriate. responses. Staring at the photos, a light goes off in Ryan's brain: SljenCel. Ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him. \n[56]Uhhmm...I was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider. Ryan takes a deep breath. \n[57]Ramius might be trying to defect. Nobody moves. Ryan glances at Greer. Greer rolls his eyes. Too far out. Ryan's on his own. The.General bristles: \n[58]Well, Ramius trained most of their Officer Corps. He'd be in a position to sect men willing to help him. And he's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth, and by heritage. He was raised by his maternal grandfather, who was a fisherman. He has no children, no ties to leave behind and - This morning was the first anniversary of his wife's death. \n[59]I know Ramins, General. He's. been a maverick for his entire career. I even met him once at an embassy dinner. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmet captain Ramius, sir? Have you ever The General darkens. Making a decision, Pelt turns to the Admiral: \n[60]It wasn't my intention, sir - \n[61]Well, somebody has to go out and try- - to contact him. \n[62]Wait a minute. The General was right. I'm just an analyst -- \n[63]Next time you get a bright idea, Jack, try putting \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 it in a memo. \n[64]Not ne s_~:4'y. If he personally recruita d the of6cers, it's theoret i ally \n[65]Perhaps it would be enough to get some I men aboard to analyze the propulsion \n[66]Perhaps. I'm not sure that --- \n[67]Can't remember. Every time I get. the chance, somebody puts me on another airplane. \n[68]Gotta be pie... Anything's possible ... Under the guise of Coast Guard... better to keep it.. how do you keep ft? Ryan's sound asleep. \n[69]brushing his teeth in the head adjacent to his stateroom on the Kennedy. Through an open door, his unmade bunk. Catching sight of himself in the mirror: \n[70]We'd have to get rid of the crew. How do you get the crew off a nuclear submarine? \n[71]Morning, Admiral. \n[72]Like the dead.  Our friends have been busy. \n[73]Could you get me aboard the Dallas? \n[74]Memos. From now on nothing but memos. \n[75]Wait a minute! \n[76]Jesus Christ! I cant believe it! Jesus Christ --\u00c2\u00bb \n[77]When I hit the water, it was like Ice. I thought I was going to freeze -- \n[78]Sorry. I'm Jack Ryan. Are you Captain Mancuso? Mancuso nods. The radioman appears with another message. Mancuso rips it open and starts reading it. Ryan rockets into \n[79]Captain, we have to find the Red October. She's a Russian -- \n[80]I have to talk to - \n[81]\n[82]What do you mean battle stations? Look, I've been authorized by the President of the United States to talk to the Captain of Red October. Mancuso takes the last message from his pocket: \n[83]I don't understand. \n[84]Wail! Think about this a second. Naturally the Soviets would tall us he is insane. They want us to sink him before he has an opportunity to defect. \n[85]Listen to me, Captain. There must be some way you can establish contact without violating your orders. I'm telling you, he wants to defect. If there's ever going to be peace in the world somebody has to take a risk. Give the man a chance. He's defecting. I know it. Please. \n[86]\n[87]What does it mean? \n[88]American government told you intend to launch mis. lc s. Do not approach U.S. coast. Repeat. Do not approach U.S. coast, or you .w&gt;7 . be attacked. If you understand, ping once. He can do that, can't he? \n[89]Send him this. \n[90]Just send it. And ten him to ping again if he agrees. \n[91]\n[92]If the Soviets want us to sink Red October. We just might have to oblige. \n[93]He's defecting. \n[94]He's not going to change his mind. \n[95]Russian Cigarette? Could I try one? Mancuso frowns. Borodin offers Ryan a cigarette. Kamarov has a light. Ryan inhales and COUGHS: \n[96]Jesus... Poking fun, Ryan rolls his eyes. Borodin grins. Ramius The ice is broken. Men shake hands. \n[97]You have a good memory, Captain. We meet briefly years ago. But I'm not a naval commander. I work for the CIA. \n[98]Easy, Captain. I'm not an agent. I'm just an analyst. I write books. Suddenly, HIGH SPEED SCREWS passing over the HULL: \n[99]\n[100]\n[101]Sorry, Captain. I think -- \n[102]Pardon? \n[103]I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey, called, Fighting Sailor. It was about tam in combat -- \n[104]What happened? \n[105]So we're safe? \n[106]Next time memos. Only memos. \n[107]Be careful what you shoot at, Ryan. Very sensitive.. .in here... \n[108]Sensitive stuff...in here ...I have to... be careful... of course. The ship turns. Wall becomes cuing. Grabbing the catwalk, Ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle. GUNFIRE. Bullets RIP into the BULKHEAD inches from his HEAD: \n[109]I have to be careful what I shoot at.. He doesn't have to be careful... He can shoot at anything he wants. \n[110]Wreckage. \n[111]We're two hundred miles from the nearest naval base. \n[112]I grew up not far from here. My grandfather taught me to f5sh right over there on that rock. Ramius spots a large rock on the shore. So warm and inviting, this land, when compared to the bitter cold coast he ]eft a ]ifetl,me ago. Ram hl studies Ryan in the stillness: \n[113]Why? I assumed you would speak when you were ready. \n[114]Your wife? \n[115]Fishing? \n[116]Welcome to the new world, sir. \n[117]sound asleep in his seat, empty tea cup on a tray beside him. A blanket hangs on one log. In the seat next to him ", "MANCUSO": "\n[1]Start a plot, Jonesy. IM be there in a second. Leaving the deck, Mancuso glances at his executive offker \n[2]I'91 be in sonar, PhiL \n[3]What do you have? \n[4]bent over Jones' shoulder in the Da11as' sonar shack, concentrating on the blinking light on the sonar display. Thompson's to his left. Jones is on a headset: \n[5]Can you identify him? \n[6]Must be a new boat. I miss something in dispatch the last few days, Phil? \n[7]Alright. Start a f]e on his, Jonesy. For now, call his Sierra thirty-five.  r91 see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out. Thompson fcDows Mancuso. Beaumont glances at Jones, whispering: \n[8]sticking his head into sonar. The COB and Beaumont are on pins and needles. Jones is working his computer furiously. \n[9]it did what? \n[10]What are you talking about? Check your gear. \n[11]\n[12]Singing? Jones nods. Hairs stand up on the back of Mancuso's neck: \n[13]Put it on the speakers. WHINING PROPELLERS and CAVITATION NOISE fi]1 the sonar shack. Suddenly, MORE PROPELLERS: \n[14]I'm gonna radio Fleet Command. He takes off. Jones hears something buried in the PROPELLERS and CAVITATION NOISE. A strange WHOOSHING SOUND. Frowning, he starts a tape rewarder. \n[15]Go ahead. \n[16]Magma displacement? \n[17]utto the chase, Jonesy._:., \n[18]So? \n[19]Headed directly into Red Route One. \n[20]Let me see if I got this straight. The three minion dollar computer tells you you're chasing after an earthquake and you aren't convinced. So you get curious and came up with this theory: on your own? \n[21]Relax, Jonesy. You sold me. Jones grans. \n[22]Let me ask you this. If we get close to this supers lent sub again, you think you can track him down? \n[23]Sonar, Conn. Anything yet, Tonesy? \n[24]at tire control in the Dallas' Conn. Thompson's on the deck. \n[25]Jones -'studies his w tern - The COB stands behind him. Beaumont watches. A]l kidding has stopped. This is strictly business: \n[26]All stop i Come left and stay in his baffles. Rig for quiet running. All compartments eliminate noise evolutions. \n[27]Damn! \n[28]!re not gonna believe this. \n[29]Whoever this guy is, he's in far one hell of a ride. Officer of the deck. Surface the ship. A flurry of activity in the Conn. The Dallas prepares to surface. Mancuso and Thompson move to a hatch by the helm. \n[30]You got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him or it! l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers 'cause most of the ship's underwater. Fun? \n[31]Good. We got no idea who this guy is or why the Navy wants his on our boat so bad. \n[32]See if you can get a ground on his line. I'm gonna try and catch the bastard! Way out on the horizon, Ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts a comet-like ride back at the ship. \n[33]Man overboard! Thompson drags himself back onto the bridge. \n[34]Man overboard! Twenty yards off the starboard bow! The COB SLAMS the HATCH, turning the trunk into an iron tomb. Jones pulls a mask over his eyes, activates his oxygen and drags open the exterior hatch. \n[35]Take it easy -- \n[36]Slow down. You're hypervent it sting. Now, who are you? \n[37]I already found him, Ryan. Then I was ordered to pick you up. \n[38]What the hell are you yammering about? \n[39]Mr. Thompson. Get this man some dry clothes and coffee. \n[40]I'Il be in the Conn. \n[41]Any sign that he's alerted to our presence? \n[42]Very well. \n[43]And I have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the United States or demonstrates any hostile intentions. \n[44]According to this he's gone bughouse and intends to fire his missiles. So much f= your defection theory. Mancuso hands Ryan the message.. Ryan stares at. it. Mancuso turns back to the officer of the deck: \n[45]Officer of the deck. Make, \n[46]All. stop i Come left and stay in his baffles. Rig for quiet running. The officer of the deck repeats Mancuso's orders. Mancuso and Ryan are eyeball-etc-eyeball.. Ryan whispers: \n[47]AIL back two-thirds. Nobody moves. Jones glances at Mancuso. Mancuso stares at Ryan The ofSt r of the deck's e d \n[48]I said, aill back two-thirds! \n[49]AIL shop! OK, Ryan. We just unzipped our fly. Now if he so much as twitches, I\"m.. gonna blow the bastard to Mars. \n[50]in the Dalla' Conn, on the deck. Thompson's at fire control. Ryan is to Mancuso's left. Crew's at battle stations. \n[51]Flood tubes one and two and make torpedos ready in all. respects. \n[52]My orders are specific, Mister. \n[53]on the DaIIas in the Conn. Eyeing Ryan, Mancuso opens a mike: \n[54]What's he doing, Jonesy? Has he \n[55]It means, he's a very cool customer, \n[56]Right ten degrees rudder. Steer course north. Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts. \n[57]Conn, aye. Fire control, range to target? \n[58]Diving oar make your depth sixty- f f ve feet. He wants to go up and take a peek, we'll play along. \n[59]All right, Mr. Ryan. You wanted to:. talk to him. There he is. What do you want to say? Ryan chooses his words carefully. As he does, Mancuso hits a periscope light in morse: \n[60]He can do that. But is he gonna do that? \n[61]I'D. be dammed. Now what? \n[62]Are you out of your mind? \n[63]Down scope. \n[64]Ryan, what's going on? \n[65]in the Conn aboard the Dallas with Thompson. Mancuso has a .45 in a holster on his belt. Thompson reads a message: \n[66]OK. Now comes the weird part. Thompson fo lows Mancuso out of the Conn into \n[67]I don't like leaving the boat, Phil. But the orders are specific. \n[68]This has got to be the craziest stunt I've ever heard of. There's only about two ml]]k n things that can st]l. go wrong. At the bottom of the ladder, they enter \n[69]Listen. If anything -- \n[70]Wait. Copilot stops. Reaching into his jacket, Mancuso offers Ryan a .45. \n[71]And he can't change his mind? \n[72]Willing to bet your life on that.' Ryan stares at the pistol. Sighing, he puts it in his jacket. Copilot opens the hatch. In the gloom below, another hatch. Copilot raps on it. Somebody opens the lower hatch. Mancuso, Jones and Ryan climb down into \n[73]His. \n[74]No shit, buckwheat. Get the hell. out of here! \n[75]Wait a minute! That's heading into the t o rpedo. You should turn away from it. \n[76]No! That's wrong. Ryan, don't turn that goddam wheel! Ryan stares at Mancuso then at Ramius. Deciding, he turns the helm left, coming to course zero-two-zero. \n[77]You're heading straight into that torpedo. \n[78]Combat tack, Mr. Ryan. By turning into the torpedo,, Ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself. I never would have thought of it. \n[79]But the control is blasted to hell. I can't shoot. \n[80]Twenty degrees down on the bowl \n[81]Left full rudder! ", "JONES": "\n[1]\n[2]Yes? \n[3]Correct, Seaman Beaumont. Surface Affects Processing. There is hope for your small brain yet. And like Mozart at Saltzburg, you have labored to produce... hiclocdc. \n[4]A whale, Beaumont. A whale. A marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do. Beaumont frowns. Appearing in the sonar shack door, directly \n[5]it was Paganini. \n[6]Be sti 1, I got it. Jones works in silence, then punches the intervom: \n[7]Conn, sonar. \n[8]Distant contact, submerged bearing zero- nine-seven. It's a wild guess, but I'd say we had a Boomer headed out of the barn. \n[9]He's holding steady on zero-two-zero, twelve knots at about ten thousand yards. \n[10]Computer's chewing on it. Twin screw and the plant noise sounds like a typhoon but - Computer ptintar CLATTERS. Ripping off the printout, Mancuso \n[11]Not if we stay in his baffles, seaman Beaumont. Not if we stay in his baffles. Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post. \n[12]in the Dalla' sonar shack, working his computer. The COB is behind him, Beaumont to his left. Red October's AMPISFIED HISS f Ms the room. Suddenly, \n[13]Don't know. \n[14]It disappeared, sir. \n[15]Running diagnostics, now, Captain. Jones is starting to sweat. He runs his tests. Nothing. urning, he stares blankly at Mancuso: \n[16]Sonar is working, sir. The Russian just disappeared. One minute he was steady four thousand yards off our bow and then he was gone. And r a second, I thought I heard... well ;-- \n[17]I thought, I heard singing, sir. \n[18]Jesus Christ. Somebody just stepped on the gas. Sonar contact, Captain. Very loud. Viktar Class Soviet submarine. Cutting big holes in the water. Bearing six- five-zero. \n[19]Jeez. There's another one. Bearing .,even-three. Hold on. There's two more out there. They're all in a hurry and don't care who the hell knows it. Have the Soviets scheduled submarine races today, sir? \n[20]working his tape recorder in the Dallas' sonar shack. Varying speeds, \u00e2\u0082\u00acftering extraneous noise, Jones is isolating the eer9e \n[21]at a translucent status board in the quartermaster's station on the Dalla. Behind the status board, projected on a screen, a nautical map of the North Atlantic. Mancuso and Thompson enter. \n[22]I know you're busy, Captain. But I may have something here. \n[23]I've been working on a sound I heard when the typhoon disappeared. I washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it. But when I asked the computer to identify it, the answer I got. was magma displacement. \n[24]Yes sir. See, the system we are using was originally- designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it. to hunt for submarines - \n[25]Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious, and. started tracking. the sound on our lateral array. I located it four different times. The fifth time it was gone and I couldn't find it. But I want to show you what I worked up. Picking up a grease pencil, Jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map: \n[26]The first contact was at zero-nine-Been hours and the bearing was two-six-nine. Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine- forty-eight is was two-ive-zero. I came back to it at about ten-hundred and the bearing was two-four-two. The last signal was real faint and I didn't have a very good lock on it. \n[27]Well, I figure it couldn't be very far away from us, right? Let's say it was halfway between us and Iceland. That would put it on a course like this. Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso recognizes a pattern: \n[28]Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and he's taking the inshore track off the Iceland coast. \n[29]Yes, sir. \n[30]Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for, I'1 bag the sucker cold. \n[31]in the Dalla' sonar shack, working furiously with his equipment. Beaumont watches. The COB's behind him. TRANSIENT ocean NOISE on SPEAKERS. Over the INTERCOM: \n[32]Conn, sonar. Negative, Captain. \n[33]He's close. I can feel it. \n[34]Don't encourage the man, seaman Beaumont. He's very old. \n[35]You're an old man, COB. Way over the ham. Your trout is so wrinkled it's about to faU off. \n[36]Speaking of which, what happened to that Hustler Magazine that was in the head? \n[37]For many months, seaman Beaumont, there was a Hustler magazine located in the crew's head. it was community property. Then one day, it disappeared. The ..COB. here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished. \n[38]I have a theory, seaman Beaumont. I believe the CO B Is like a black widow, spider. After he has sex with a magazine, he eats it. Beaumont HOWLS. The COB turns pink. \n[39]\n[40]Conn, sonar. Signal to noise ratio is dropping. Possib3e aspect change on Sierra thirty-five, Red October. \n[41]Conn, sonar. Crazy Ivan! \n[42]The Soviet Captain has a blind spot astern in his baffles and he's turning suddenly to see if he can catch us there. It's a trick the Soviets use called a crazy Ivan turn. Your average skipper might get caught with his pants down. Not Mancuso. We stop all engines and turn with him. Staying in his baffles. Quiet as a mouse. Beaumont frowns. Seconds pass. Working his equipment, Jones WHISPERS into his MIKE: \n[43]Conn, sonar. Red October is coming left. My read is he's returning to base course. \n[44]Are. you injured!? \n[45]I'm gonna take you in through an escape trunk! Jones hooks Ryan to the line. Salt stings Ryan's eyes. His, breathing's ragged. \n[46]Listen, you son-af-a-bit h. I'm only gonna tell you once. Stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe! Ryan takes the mouthpiece, inhaling and exhaling rapidly. The helicopter circles above. Jones drags Ryan \n[47]No, sir, captain. operating as before. Ryan appears in dry clothes. Mancuso ignores him. The of5cer of the deck turns to Mancuso: \n[48]Captain, crazy Ivan. \n[49]Negative, Captain. He's just matting there. Hold on -- Hull popping. Target's coming shallow. Mancuso frowns. The crew's a cased spring. Ryan's walking on \n[50]Conn, sonar. My only contact is Sierra thirty-five, Red October. Bearing two- seven-zero. \n[51]Wrong. Ours growl. Yours whine. It's Russian! \n[52]DSRV is away. There's a Russian Akula about eight thousand yards starboard. \n[53]Torpedo in the water. High speed screws. Beaming zero-two-zero. I estimate range at about eight thousand yards. \n[54]Steady bearing to the weapon. Still zero-two-zero. Range about seven thousand yards. \n[55]Torpedo steady bearing zero-two-zero. Range five thousand yards. \n[56]Estimate range approximately three thousand yards. Closing fast. \n[57]Torpedo bearing steady at zero-two- zero. Best range nine hundred yards. Estimate impact in twenty seconds. \n[58]Fifteen seconds. \n[59]Ten seconds. \n[60]He's going deep! \n[61]Another torpedo, Captain. It has enabled and is active. It has acquired us and is homing. \n[62]Launch transient astern. He's shooting again. Very close. \n[63]Weapon is alive. It has acquired. Sound of torpedo passing close to the hull: \n[64]Weapon passed close aboard. Is Ong re-attack. Hold on. It's reacquired. But not on us! Ryan appears with Ramius aft of the Conn. Pinging grows QUIETER, more DISTANT. ", "GREER": "\n[1]Jack, boy. Get yourself in here. Jesus. You look like hell. \n[2]Come on over here and sit down.

Give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand. He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers and say what you think. Yowll do fine. Come on. Ryan takes a deep breath. \n[28]Yes, sir. The preliminary briefing today w M be handled by Dr. Jack Ryan. I believe you've seen some of his :work. \n[29]Absence of activity in the Pacific suggest this is probably just an exercise having nothing to do with the Red October. A General starts to object. He's cut off by JUDGE MOORE, a white-haired civilian near the top of the table: \n[30]Whose uncle? \n[31]I said speak your mind, Jack, but \n[32]And you understand, Lieutenant. I was never here. That torpedo did not self-destruct. It hit the target. Right? Now, Contact the Dallas and tell them to proceed. Curry nods. \n[33]leaning over Curry's console in the CIC aboard the frigate. Agitated, Curry works his computer. \n[34]What do you mean there's another torpedo? Where in hell did it come from? \n[35]Mother of God. \n[36]", "PELT": "\n[1]Let's get started. \n[2]You may begin.

I'll brief the President. That will, be all, gentlemen. Dr. Ryan. Would you stay for a moment, please? Everyone gets up to leave. As Greer rises, he winks at Ryan: \n[11]You slammed the door on the General pretty hard, Jack. \n[12]Yes it was. He was patronizing you and you stomped on him. In my opinion, he deserved It. Look, I'm a politk:ian, Jack. That means I'm a liar, a cheat and when I'm nvt kissing babies I'm stealing their lallipops. But it also means I know people and keep my options open. Let's assume for a minute that you're right and he intends to defect What do you think we should do? \n[13]OK. When can you leave? \n[14]Perfect. I can't ask any of these cha\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtacters to go. None of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line. And anyway, none of them are expendable. IR]. give you three days to prove your theory, after that we won't have any choice but to hunt Ramius down and blow him away. Will, you do it? Ryan stares at Pelt. \n[15]Forgive me, Ambassador, for dispensing with the usual formalities. But the President views this situation as critical. Our m,7 ttary counts thirty-two of your anti-submarine aircraft in the sky laying down enough sonar buoys that a man could walk from Greenland to Norway without getting his feet wet. What's going on? \n[16]So do I, Ambassador Lysenko. Confusion could be -- Catastrophic. \n[17]How can I help you, Ambassador? \n[18]Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met? \n[19]So one of your submarine captains has gone insane?
