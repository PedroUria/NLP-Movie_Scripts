Where you taking me anyway? \n[157]Any good? \n[158]... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.

Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement. \n[189]Snails for dinner.  No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood. \n[190]You're upset, huh? \n[191]You liked the guy, though. \n[192]We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it. Except with you.  At your price I give my all... \n[193]Let's not talks about this heavy stuff.  Come on, relax. \n[194]Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?

I walk a lot. \n[236]Well, I do often spa there. \n[237]Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money. \n[238]I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur. \n[239]Hi.  I never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun. \n[240]Huh?

What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends! \n[250]I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight. \n[251]Stuckey!  He wants an \"appointment\" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own? \n[252]I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you. \n[253]Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money. \n[254]Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone. \n[255]Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in. \n[256]Fuck off. \n[257]I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off. \n[258]You hurt me. \n[259]C'mon, Kit... \n[260]Do I look okay? \n[261]What's that? \n[262]Edward, I can't. \n[263]What if I lose it? \n[264]What if someone tries to steal it? \n[265]Plane? \n[266]Where are you taking me!? \n[267]Huh? \n[268]I've never been on a plane before. \n[269]Being quiet. \n[270]You ever been in love with anyone? \n[271]Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that. \n[272]You mean, besides Elvis? I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff. \n[273]My father found me.  Dragged me home.  I don't know why, he never seemed to like me much when I was there. 'Cept when he was drunk, then he liked me a whole lot. I made it back to Atlanta a year later.  Andy was gone. \n[274]Aw, but things sure look fine when you're sitting way up high. \n[275]If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying? \n[276]But don't they have it in English? \n[277]Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me. \n[278]It was so beautiful I just about pissed my pants. \n[279]I more than liked it. \n[280]Did you? \n[281]Love you... \n[282]Mmm. Hi. \n[283]Here.  Let me. \n[284]Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take. \n[285]What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town? \n[286]I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it... \n[287]then continues tying his tie \n[288]I know. Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid. I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore. \n[289]You just did. \n[290]Hello. Hi. \n[291]Hello.  Is Kit DeLuca there? When she comes in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000. Yes.  Okay. \n[292]What did you do to him? \n[293]Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you liked him. \n[294]Right. \n[295]Business. \n[296]It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business. \n[297]Lo? \n[298]Me? \n[299]Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling. \n[300]Who did you think? \n[301]Kit, I left that money for you days ago. \n[302]Kit... \n[303]Yeah... I know what you mean. \n[304]You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you? \n[305]I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth. \n[306]I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real. \n[307]It was great. \n[308]He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money. \n[309]All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit? \n[310]I don't care about bucks. I might love this guy. \n[311]Edward's not back.  I thought he was with you. \n[312]No. \n[313]I think it's great. \n[314]Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business. \n[315]Get out! \n[316]Are you crazy? \n[317]Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off! \n[318]Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross. \n[319]It was good. \n[320]I'm leaving. Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please. \n[321]Aw, don't... no... \n[322]I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.

I hadn't planned this. \n[64]Always. \n[65]Fair enough. \n[66]Let's talk some more first. \n[67]Uh-huh. \n[68]And why do you say that? \n[69]Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers. \n[70]Champagne. \n[71]Where would we like it?  Here'll be fine. \n[72]I think he wanted you to tip him. \n[73]I have both. \n[74]They should be.  They're both good at it. \n[75]My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home. My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak.  Cheers. \n[76]It's a very good year. \n[77]Try a strawberry. \n[78]Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne. \n[79]Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate. \n[80]You really are a very beautiful girl. \n[81]Yes... \n[82]What do you like? \n[83]It's open. \n[84]Sorry.  Go ahead. \n[85]I want to. \n[86]I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it. \n[87]Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car... \n[88]I'll bring it back. \n[89]Good morning. \n[90]No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast? \n[91]Did you sleep well? \n[92]Occupational hazard? \n[93]I took the couch.  I had some work to do. About last night... \n[94]Mmm, I could tell. \n[95]I'd say you give a good dollar value. \n[96]Do you ever... enjoy it? \n[97]No?  Why's that? \n[98]I buy companies. \n[99]The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million. \n[100]I sell them. \n[101]By breaking up a company's assets -- \n[102]Vivian -- \n[103]Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit. \n[104]Not... quite. \n[105]Where'd you learn to do this? \n[106]Don't drown. \n[107]Yes. \n[108]I'm a big boy. \n[109]I'm here. \n[110]I have one. \n[111]All right.  How much for the week? \n[112]I'm in town until Saturday. \n[113]Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week? \n[114]Of course.  How much? \n[115]Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500. \n[116]All right, two thousand. \n[117]Done. \n[118]I'm not just talking about sex. \n[119]Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go. \n[120]I'll be out most of the day. \n[121]I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes. \n[122]Nothing too flashy, not too sexy. Conservative.  Understand? \n[123]Think again.  I'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight. \n[124]Probably. \n[125]What's that long building over there? \n[126]Not with those smokestacks it's not. \n[127]You what? \n[128]Don't bother. \n[129]We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides... You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you? \n[130]I want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away.  I want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them. \n[131]What time's diner tonight? \n[132]No one you know. \n[133]Never answer the phone.  Ever. \n[134]Did you buy some clothes? \n[135]Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate. \n[136]Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it? \n[137]This isn't a date. \n[138]The Rex. \n[139]I think you'll approve. \n[140]Thank you very much. \n[141]I thought I told you not to answer the phone. \n[142]Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment -- \n[143]My what? \n[144]I think we both know she's not my niece. \n[145]Does this hotel have any problem with that? \n[146]Thank you. \n[147]I'm sorry. \n[148]Please don't patronize me, Mr. Kross.  Our ages mean nothing here. \n[149]Twenty-five percent. \n[150]What do you suggest, Mr. Kross? \n[151]To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything. \n[152]You're not getting any navy contracts. \n[153]But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... Ah, the escargot. \n[154]Snails. \n[155]Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours. \n[156]No.  What I have is a lot of money. \n[157]What I did with those companies was perfectly legal. \n[158]It is not your company.  It's a public company.  And I am going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you. \n[159]I would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win. \n[160]We can reach an understanding on this. \n[161]Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally. \n[162]And that's the way the game is played. \n[163]No.  Bring a check, please. \n[164]Thank you. \n[165]Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business. \n[166]Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive. \n[167]That... is very good. \n[168]Television? \n[169]I have work to do. \n[170]Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop. \n[171]I still don't understand why you only bought one dress. \n[172]Why not? \n[173]Was someone rude to you? \n[174]Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. \n[175]People aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself. The next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here. \n[176]It's an old trick I use, especially with bankers.  Works every time.  Will you try it? \n[177]Good. \n[178]He's a tough old son of a bitch... \n[179]Offer nine and a half.  Bring them back down to earth. \n[180]Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away. \n[181]Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise. \n[182]I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now. \n[183]Do it. \n[184]You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work.  Be sensible and you can keep everything.  Spend too much and it all goes back. \n[185]Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money. \n[186]Get the bank on the phone for me. \n[187]Thank you.  I would. Nice. \n[188]Please. \n[189]Dinner can wait. \n[190]No. \n[191]Easier than learning how to be poor. My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him. \n[192]Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him. \n[193]He died a long time ago. \n[194]I think it's exciting. \n[195]I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard. \n[196]Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian. \n[197]He's good at what he does. \n[198]Shall we mingle? \n[199]She is, isn't she. \n[200]I'm sure that's true for some of them. \n[201]Ready to stomp sod? \n[202]We just did. \n[203]The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions. \n[204]Yes... \n[205]Vivian's in sales. \n[206]Why do you want to know? \n[207]She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie. \n[208]You're being ridiculous. \n[209]Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard. \n[210]Let's drop it, shall we? \n[211]Excuse me a moment. \n[212]You're awfully quiet.  You haven't said a word since the party. \n[213]Vivian, what the -- \n[214]I don't know what you're talking about. \n[215]Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened. \n[216]What was I supposed to do? I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent. \n[217]Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down? \n[218]Vivian... \n[219]Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you. \n[220]I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up. \n[221]Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you. \n[222]I really am sorry. \n[223]I'll make it up to you. \n[224]Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow. \n[225]Goodbye, Bill. \n[226]Afternoon. \n[227]Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing. \n[228]I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however... \n[229]This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight.  There. Come look. \n[230]Shush.  Of course you can. \n[231]You won't. \n[232]I'll guard them and you with my life. \n[233]Very good. \n[234]You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't. \n[235]To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker... \n[236]The opera. \n[237]I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these. \n[238]Vivian, what do you think you're doing? \n[239]Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you. Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone? \n[240]What happened to him? \n[241]Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it.  You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  They either love it or hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it. \n[242]Viv?  I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it. \n[243]They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian. \n[244]I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words. \n[245]Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it. \n[246]What am I?  I am a poet.  Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams.  You have come to replace my vanished dreams.  I dwell now only in your eyes. \n[247]And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful -- \n[248]If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you. \n[249]I know.  I'm glad. \n[250]Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you. \n[251]Yes? \n[252]I'm up. \n[253]Why? \n[254]Give me twenty minutes. \n[255]Better get dressed.  We're having guests. \n[256]One more night and you're finally rid of me. \n[257]I have to go to New York tomorrow. \n[258]But I'll be back in Los Angeles. Soon.  I'd like to see you again. I thought we could work out something... An arrangement. \n[259]I'll get you an apartment, buy you a car -- \n[260]What is it? \n[261]It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that? \n[262]Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution. \n[263]Vivian, life's not a fairy tale. \n[264]I've never treated you like a whore. \n[265]How are you, Mr. Kross. \n[266]Expected... offer. \n[267]You're making the right decision, sir. \n[268]Excuse me, please? \n[269]What do you mean? \n[270]Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated. \n[271]It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all. \n[272]Yes.  The man made a business decision. \n[273]It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money. \n[274]I'll be back in a few hours. We'll talk about this later. \n[275]We'll continue this down at the office. \n[276]What? \n[277]Who indeed... \n[278]Stop.  For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct? \n[279]If you had a... reprieve, what would do? \n[280]Let him answer. \n[281]How? \n[282]I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that. \n[283]I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you? \n[284]This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I? \n[285]You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home. \n[286]Have a good day, gentlemen. \n[287]No... take the car back to the hotel.  I need to walk. \n[288]I think I broke my hand. You're fired. \n[289]And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole! \n[290]Yes. \n[291]Well, I didn't plan that! \n[292]Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore. \n[293]It was a business decision. \n[294]I got tired of hating my father. \n[295]It felt good. \n[296]You're packing. \n[297]Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to. \n[298]Vivian... \n[299]That's everything. \n[300]Yes.  She go. \n[301]Yes. \n[302]I'm looking for a girl, Vivian, young, dark hair, big eyes...? \n[303]She's mouthy.  Sort of difficult...? \n[304]Thank you.  No. ", "STUCKEY": "\n[1]This is a \"no brainer\".  There's no risk for you.  No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris. \n[2]Come on.  You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us! \n[3]Hah!  Did you see the look on their faces? \n[4]NO way!  They'll come back.  They can't afford not to.  Edward, that bluff was beautiful. \n[5]Cynthia?  Is she coming out? \n[6]Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent, uh, uh, Millicent. \n[7]Lowell, right.  My wife, Elizabeth. \n[8]What's up, where you going? \n[9]At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you. \n[10]Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you... \n[11]Cynthia's not coming? \n[12]Let your driver take you.  We'll move the cars... \n[13]Can you drive a stick? \n[14]Edward, give me a break! \n[15]Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going! \n[16]That's the wrong way! \n[17]Kross knows we're after his company.  He wants to talk with you.  I don't think you should. \n[18]Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal. \n[19]You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him. \n[20]Oh, god, what? \n[21]Edward, it's me.  Kross is all set for tonight. \n[22]Listen, I gotta say this again, I don't like you going alone. \n[23]Let me at least get you a date. Keep it social. \n[24]Edward, did you hear me? \n[25]I know a lot of nice girls. \n[26]Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  It gives me a hard-on. \n[27]What kind of an idiot are you? You don't talk about this to anyone. \n[28]Where did you dig this moron up? \n[29]What!? \n[30]Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune. \n[31]Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking? \n[32]Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight? \n[33]Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry. \n[34]We're letting them slide? \n[35]But, Edward... \n[36]You were right.  Kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank.  Not just any bank.  One we do business with. \n[37]It goes without saying that your business means a great deal more to them than our friend Kross's. All you have to do is make a call. \n[38]Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars -- \n[39]And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed. \n[40]Edward! \n[41]Come on!  Over here! \n[42]Well, well, well... \n[43]Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth. \n[44]Lots of fun people here.  Let me get you two some champagne. \n[45]Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet? \n[46]Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this. \n[47]And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work? \n[48]Doing what? \n[49]Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell? \n[50]Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross. \n[51]So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient. \n[52]Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information? \n[53]I swear to God, you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker! \n[54]Having a good time, Vivian? \n[55]All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard. \n[56]It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me. \n[57]What do you charge, Vivian? Maybe you and I could get together after Edward leaves. \n[58]I just might do that. \n[59]This is no time to disappear. We're in too far. \n[60]Promise me you'll read those contracts by then. \n[61]Shit... By tomorrow, Edward! \n[62]Did I wake you? \n[63]I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today. \n[64]He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there? \n[65]We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning. \n[66]Let's not waste time here, shall we?  Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now listening. \n[67]They'll be taken care of.  Won't they, Edward? \n[68]Today. \n[69]If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company. \n[70]Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid.  The more we know, the higher our bid can be. \n[71]That's unfair! \n[72]I don't think there's any sense in -- \n[73]Oh, my god... Edward, no! \n[74]Have you lost your mind? \n[75]What!? \n[76]Edward, what happened?  What kind of move was that? \n[77]Dammit Edward, speak to me. \n[78]Well, well... Hello again.  I'm looking for Edward. \n[79]No, I'll just have to wait then, won't I? \n[80]Mind if I have a drink? \n[81]Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why? What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities. \n[82]I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal. \n[83]But what do I know, maybe you're worth it.  Come on, show me. Let's see your act. \n[84]Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore? \n[85]You got a mean streak in you, don't you. \n[86]Is that what he likes about you? Huh?  Answer me! \n[87]You broke my nose. \n[88]Edward, we've been together ten years. \n[89]All this because of that whore! \n[90]Edward, think about what you're -- ", "KIT": "\n[1]Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv. \n[2]Carlos had some great rock. \n[3]Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores. \n[4]So I blew our stash.  We could make it all back with one good night on the streets. \n[5]Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise. \n[6]I will.  I'm trying. Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high? \n[7]Okay. I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid. \n[8]No no, honey.  You see these stars on the sidewalk.  Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers. This is our office.  We got seniority.  Get off our corner. \n[9]But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong. \n[10]Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and -- \n[11]I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home. \n[12]Hey, hey -- There's a rent. \n[13]Don't take less than a hundred. You look hot tonight.  And remember, don't mouth off.  They don't like that. \n[14]You're the greatest.  I'll wait up for you. \n[15]'Lo. \n[16]I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay? \n[17]Why'd he want you? \n[18]I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back. Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'? \n[19]I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye. \n[20]In Beverly Hills? \n[21]Baby!  Rodeo Drive. \n[22]Viv?  Where are you, babe? The sphincter-police won't let me through. \n[23]Was that you? \n[24]Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks... \n[25]Yeah.  I just got it. \n[26]Fifty bucks, grampa.  For seventy-five, the wife can watch. \n[27]Everybody keeps starin' at me. \n[28]What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up. You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway. \n[29]Where do you fit? \n[30]Honey, you're not supposed to do that. \n[31]Oh, my god, you mean it was good? \n[32]Dummy. \n[33]I pray for that. \n[34]Go for the bucks. \n[35]Wow, are you in deep shit. You know he'll break your heart. \n[36]I blame myself here.  First time I laid eyes on ya', I knew you were too complicated to be a whore. \n[37]So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco? \n[38]What kind of school? \n[39]So did I.  I made it with the principal. Study hard And get a \"B.\"  Lift your dress and an \"A\" you'll see. \n[40]Do I!?  Momma! \n[41]And leave all this?  Not in a million. \n[42]What time's your bus? \n[43]Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy. \n[44]No.  You took care of rent, that's enough. \n[45]I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day. \n[46]Shit, I'm gettin' all weepy now. \n[47]Take care of you, okay?  Take care of you.  Love ya... \n[48]Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a grilled cheese on white, okay? \n[49]Hey, how you doin'.  You new, huh? \n[50]Sure. \n[51]Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm, I'll be back. \n[52]Edward Harris, as I live and breathe! \n[53]Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she said. \n[54]You comin' or not?  I don't got all day, I got a grilled cheese waitin'. ", "KROSS": "\n[1]So young man, I understand you are trying to take over my company. \n[2]Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself.  I know every man who ever worked there by his first name.  I know their wives... and their children.  If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again. \n[3]What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price. \n[4]You've got a lot of nerve. \n[5]I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks. \n[6]I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you. \n[7]If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris... Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke. \n[8]Mr. Harris. \n[9]Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it. \n[10]Young lady. \n[11]Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer. \n[12]Of course, yes.  After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid. \n[13]I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me... \n[14]I'll sign anything you want then. \n[15]Today. \n[16]Could we at least wait till after the filing period? \n[17]It's in my best interest to cooperate, David. \n[18]He's young.  He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll sign your papers.  And I'll answer your questions.  Whatever you want. \n[19]Yes. \n[20]I... I would take advantage of it. \n[21]I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time... \n[22]Quiet. Would I get the loans? \n[23]You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris. ", "DAVID": "\n[1]Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share. \n[2]We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note... \n[3]There's no way you could know that. \n[4]Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job. \n[5]I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have. \n[6]I do.  I take it all very personally. Very nice meeting you, Vivian. \n[7]I like your hat. \n[8]Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder. \n[9]Thunder's a horse.  Come on. \n[10]Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian. You two been together long?  You and Edward? \n[11]Hope to be? \n[12]I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. \n[13]I'm sorry, am I being too forward? \n[14]I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch. \n[15]Hello, Vivian. \n[16]Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate.  You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all. \n[17]If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh? \n[18]You bed it is. You're everything he said you were. Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it. ", "SALESWOMAN": "\n[1]May I help you? \n[2]Are you looking for something in particular? \n[3]Yes... \n[4]I don't think it would fit you. \n[5]It's very expensive. \n[6]Excuse me? \n[7]I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place. \n[8]Isn't this lovely?  I think it would look wonderful on you. \n[9]Would you like to try it on? \n[10]Yes? \n[11]No, I'm sorry, I don't. ", "VANCE": "\n[1]Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal. \n[2]You don't think we pushed too hard? \n[3]Okay... this is the jewel in Kross's crown.  We can strip out all the heavy equipment.  Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas.  The Japanese are salivating for them. \n[4]Let me check. \n[5]He's right, Jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. It won't happen again, Edward. I'll pull him off the project immediately. \n[6]This is interesting.  That building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant.  They closed it down after World War \n[7]Kross came out of his corner swinging.  He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened. \n[8]It's up to ten and a quarter. ", "LANDLORD": "\n[1]Vivian. \n[2]Rent.  You're late. \n[3]Kit give me nothin'. \n[4]Of rent I do not bullshit. \n[5]By the end of the week or you're otta here. By the way, you look very nice tonight! \n[6]Hey, we announce guests here. You a relative of somebody? \n[7]Viv -- is that you? \n[8]You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice threads.  I gotta find time to shop. ", "JAKE": "\n[1]Storage, I think. \n[2]The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said -- \n[3]I talked to some developers about the land. \n[4]They're close friends, they'd never breathe a word -- \n[5]It won't happen again, Mr. Harris. \n[6]Congratulations, sir. \n[7]Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won. \n[8]Who are you going after next, sir? ", "BRIDGET": "\n[1]You must be Vivian. \n[2]Let's look at you... \n[3]Where are you from, dear? \n[4]No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town? \n[5]You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes? \n[6]Philip!  We'll need shoes! \n[7]Your uncle will like this. \n[8]They never are, dear.
