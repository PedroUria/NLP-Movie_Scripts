{"dialogues": {"NIKOLAI": "\n[1]I'll think of an excuse. Your excuses are like fucking fairy tales. \n[2]Maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for Christmas. \n[3]Nice bike. \n[4]Nice bike. \n[5]A Ural. You don't see them anymore. \n[6]How much do you want for it? \n[7]`Sentimental value'.   I've heard of that. \n[8]You're not staying for the party? \n[9]Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead? \n[10]Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know? \n[11]Have you got a hair dryer? \n[12]You'd better burn that. \n[13]Did you finish cutting his hair? \n[14]I just thought you might want six- fifty out of his pockets. \n[15]OK, now I'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers. You might want to leave the room. \n[16]You too, Kirill. \n[17]If you want to dump a body, this is the place. The currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier. \n[18]Yeah, yeah, I know. \n[19]What? You never seen anybody pissed before? \n[20]Come on, Kirill. Where are your keys? \n[21]Who are you, anyway? \n[22]We went to a Kurdish place. They don't even celebrate Christmas. \n[23]I think he's had enough. \n[24]We're partners. \n[25]He's thunder, I'm lightning. He makes all the noise, I do all the damage. \n[26]Well, you got more than a driver. \n[27]I run a mini-cab business. \n[28]Albanians, Chechens, Russians. They deliver packages. Anything. Anywhere. \n[29]I only took this job so that I could get to meet you. I think you and I could do business together. \n[30]You've got water in it. \n[31]The postmen used these. In my village. When I was a boy. Russian copy of BMW flat twin. \n[32]Get a bus. \n[33]You got far to go? \n[34]I'm a driver. I even do limousines. Look... \n[35]If Semyon found out I let one of his guests walk home in the rain, he'd fire me. And I can take care of your bike. So... \n[36]So you're a midwife. Jesus. \n[37]What's it like? \n[38]I didn't faint, but it was close. \n[39]Yeah, I know, I know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? Thinking about it. This time of year. They're back in Yekaterinburg. In the forests. Near the mountains. \n[40]I'm... sort of freelance. \n[41]I meet lots of girls called Tatiana. \n[42]In that case, no, I never heard of her. \n[43]I thought you did birth. \n[44]You know what? I hate the rain. This time of year. You ever been to Russia at Christmas? Man, snow that covers your whole house. \n[45]Oh yeah. And the ice. Whole lakes covered in ice. You don't want to walk across them, though. Ice gets thin where you least expect it. \n[46]Like I said, I'm a driver. I go left, I go right, I go straight ahead. That's it. \n[47]What? \n[48]Christmas present. \n[49]And what did he say? \n[50]What's it to you? \n[51]I'm just enjoying myself, man... \n[52]OK, OK, Jesus... \n[53]What?       What's the matter with you? \n[54]You've drunk enough Kirill. \n[55]Her. \n[56]Yeah? \n[57]Well if my examination is over, get the fuck out of here while I get dressed. \n[58]What's your last name? \n[59]Tell me your last name. \n[60]Where are you from? \n[61]Where? Which village? Which town? \n[62]Stay alive a little longer. \n[63]From where? \n[64]Import-export sounds good. \n[65]Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's no point lying to him. \n[66]Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat. Kirill paid him to do it. \n[67]Your dad always knows the truth anyway. \n[68]But it's OK boss. You don't have to worry... \n[69]I disposed of the body myself. The police won't find a thing. \n[70]The vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain. \n[71]When I found out what had happened, I did what I had to do to clean the situation up. \n[72]It was a matter of honor. Soyka was spreading lies about Kirill. About your family. Kirill did the right thing. \n[73]You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police. \n[74]I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard. \n[75]Kirill did a good thing for all our people. Our people will know that. \n[76]That's OK. Kirill has got me. \n[77]Meet in a public place with lots of people around. Very wise. \n[78]And I see you brought along a body guard. Also very wise. \n[79]When you were in what? \n[80]What address? \n[81]I don't know what you're talking about. \n[82]Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna. \n[83]You belong in there. With nice people. Stay away from people like me. \n[84]Nasdrovia. \n[85]It was nothing important. \n[86]I don't want to repeat it. \n[87]That he is a drunk.    And that he is also... a queer. \n[88]So why don't you go home? \n[89]FSB.   They are called FSB now. \n[90]I met him. \n[91]I thought I'd bring it back before it got stolen. Lot of villains around. Sorry about the chain. \n[92]I got that address you wanted. \n[93]A little village outside St. Petersburg. I know it. Not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. Especially not a girl. \n[94]If you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in London. Maybe with you. Why not? Tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed. \n[95]I told you.    I'm just a driver. \n[96]I'm a camera. The pictures stay in my head. \n[97]I don't know. I was passing. \n[98]Oh, and... your uncle. \n[99]Is it true he was in the KGB? \n[100]Well, he's a brave old man.    That's for sure. \n[101]Does he live with you? \n[102]I fixed it.    It should be OK now. \n[103]What are you doing here? \n[104]She's a civilian! \n[105]There is nothing to tell.      Slaves give birth to slaves... \n[106]No. \n[107]Thank you. Papa. \n[108]What shall I tell Kirill? \n[109]He offered me stars. I accepted them. \n[110]Yeah. \n[111]I know, Kirill. \n[112]Your dad don't need the bottles any more. \n[113]My father was a government worker. He fixed the cars of officials. I began by selling the spare parts when I was fifteen. \n[114]None. \n[115]I spent two years in the punishment block. \n[116]I was in solitary confinement fifteen times. I was called 'The Stump' because they couldn't shift me. \n[117]That's right. My father means nothing to me. My Mother.... \n[118]Yes. I have no mother and no father. There is only the code, the vory v zakone code which I have always followed. \n[119]I am dead already. I died when I was fifteen. Now I live in the zone all the time. \n[120]I have lived off Albanians and Georgians. I steal from them within the law. \n[121]How come? \n[122]Where do they dock? \n[123]Ozim? \n[124]I thought you did birth. \n[125]Yes. \n[126]He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh. In a five-star hotel. \n[127]I'm going to need some clothes. I arrived here without any. Can you get me some? \n[128]I can't walk out of here naked. \n[129]Your uncle knew too much. \n[130]I was told to get rid of him. I was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. Instead I sent him to Edinburgh. With a first-class ticket. \n[131]He is of the old school. He understood the situation. Exile or death. Edinburgh was his idea. He said they throw a great party at New Year. And he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family. \n[132]So... just a pair of jeans and a T- shirt. A jacket. And some shoes. \n[133]The hotel is called the Caledonian. \n[134]You got my message? \n[135]It's called improvisation. \n[136]You didn't come here to give me flowers... \n[137]Ah, Christ... \n[138]If they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this... \n[139]You tell the Russian desk you saw stars over my heart. OK? Tell them I'm through the door. \n[140]Tell them I only killed myself. \n[141]And you can tell them I'm going to replace Semyon at the head of the London organization. \n[142]I need you to take Semyon out of the picture. I want you to arrest him. \n[143]Rape. \n[144]The girl was fourteen. \n[145]She doesn't have to.   She's dead. \n[146]But she had Semyon's baby. If you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape. \n[147]All you need is the baby and some of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood. \n[148]How is Uncle Stepan? \n[149]Hey... wait a minute... \n[150]Is your bike still working OK? \n[151]Did you get in touch with Tatiana's family in Russia? \n[152]Good. \n[153]So the baby's still in England. \n[154]Yeah, and all the thanks I get is a pair of dead man's shoes. I listen to you.                                    * \n[155]These things are just marks on the skin, you know? \n[156]What are you talking about?! \n[157]You brought your bike? \n[158]I'll drive. \n[159]Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little babies. \n[160]Something like this would be bad for all of us. Your dad has gone too far, Kirill. \n[161]It's our turn now. \n[162]He's going away. When he's gone the family business will be yours. \n[163]We can be partners again. Thunder and lightning, right? \n[164]Get into the car. I'll drive you home. \n[165]You're OK, yeah? \n[166]How can I become King if the King is still in place? \n[167]Maybe I can drive you somewhere? ", "ANNA": "\n[1]Did you get a name? \n[2]Darling... darling, can you hear me? \n[3]We need to get the baby out now. \n[4]You had a girl. \n[5]Oh, don't be ridiculous. \n[6]In the whole entire history of my life, I have never felt this special. \n[7]A bit. \n[8]Mum?       Are you OK? \n[9]You should have done beef, then. \n[10]Well, I can't read Russian, can I? \n[11]I told you, Uncle Stepan, I found it in the handbag of a girl who died in my ward. \n[12]Of course, we all do it. It's one of the perks of working in a hospital. \n[13]Stepan, is there an address? \n[14]Body.   Singular. \n[15]How long will dinner be? \n[16]I know. \n[17]Sorry... I'm a midwife. \n[18]I'd like to speak to the Manager. \n[19]My dad was Russian. \n[20]Ivan. \n[21]God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that. \n[22]That's OK. I'll probably find out more when I get her diary translated. \n[23]I found her diary in her bag. \n[24]I was going to ask my uncle.... \n[25]Dosvedania. \n[26]Yes, always. \n[27]No, thanks.     I'm driving. \n[28]What? \n[29]Thank you. \n[30]It was my dad's. \n[31]It has sentimental value. \n[32]No. \n[33]It's Christmas. Everything's closed. \n[34]I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit. \n[35]He didn't run away. You make me sound like a burning building. \n[36]What the hell has that got to do with it? \n[37]It's Christmas. I'm thirty-one. \n[38]I don't give a damn about Stepan. Who has that poor baby got in the whole world? \n[39]Good. Fine.     So you know everything. \n[40]The baby is my responsibility until I hand her over to the mother. The mother is dead. \n[41]The proper authorities will all be skiing until after New Year. \n[42]What grieving? \n[43]I'm not hungry. \n[44]Is it OK? \n[45]I copied the whole thing. \n[46]I'm going to keep it. Maybe give it to Tatiana's daughter someday. \n[47]Not far.    I can drop by and pick it up. \n[48]I'm fine.    I'm on my motorbike. \n[49]After Christmas, they'll do a missing persons report. \n[50]The police. \n[51]Water?    What makes you think that? \n[52]Just across the park. \n[53]You get used to it. \n[54]How many have you got? \n[55]What, you don't know? \n[56]Left here. \n[57]So Semyon employs you? \n[58]You said he'd fire you. \n[59]Did you ever meet a girl called Tatiana? \n[60]She was pregnant. \n[61]She died last night on my shift. \n[62]Sometimes birth and death go together. She had needle punctures all over both arms. Dehydration, emaciation. Early presentation of syphilis. Probably a prostitute. At the age of fourteen. \n[63]You think Semyon's son knew her? \n[64]Just here is great. \n[65]How much do I owe you? \n[66]What? Stepan, what? I'm late for work. \n[67]Who gave you that? \n[68]Mum, you can't go through my things. \n[69]And he said he wouldn't do it so I've found somebody else. \n[70]Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again. \n[71]Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again. \n[72]I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. She's very beautiful. \n[73]Tell him I've heard bad words before. \n[74]Momma, this is London. \n[75]How did you get in here? \n[76]You're not allowed in here. \n[77]What does it say about him? \n[78]I don't care about him.   I care about the baby. \n[79]It's OK.   He's just leaving. \n[80]No. \n[81]He came to see me. \n[82]The man from the restaurant.    He came to the hospital. \n[83]I know it's my fault... \n[84]Shut up both of you!!! \n[85]OK... now... what would dad have done? \n[86]You never worked for the fucking \n[87]The diary. In return he'll give us an address for Tatiana's family. For Christine's family. \n[88]Stepan, I think he was threatening to harm Christine. \n[89]How the hell can you eat? \n[90]That's their driver. \n[91]Now you give me the address. \n[92]Tatiana's family. \n[93]She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped her! \n[94]You murdered her! You bastards murdered her! \n[95]You read the diary? \n[96]So how can you keep doing what you're doing? \n[97]You look the other way. \n[98]Why did you bring me this? \n[99]I don't know. \n[100]Mum... I can't get hold of Stepan. \n[101]I need to check something with him. \n[102]He's not at home, do you know where else he might be? \n[103]I think I've worked out who Christine's father is. \n[104]It matters... to me!! \n[105]I don't know. I was passing. \n[106]Family is important to you people isn't it? \n[107]Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter. \n[108]When he raped her she was a virgin. Then they gave her pills. Semyon has to be the father! \n[109]She was fourteen!      She was a child! \n[110]Tell him what I said. \n[111]I don't think the driver would do anything to Stepan. \n[112]I'm so late. Sorry. \n[113]Oh God... \n[114]Paul, on my way here I made a decision. \n[115]Take my hand. \n[116]Feel my pulse. \n[117]I'm going to apply to adopt Christine. \n[118]Can you feel that? \n[119]Is it OK to talk to him for a minute? \n[120]Yes. \n[121]My uncle.... \n[122]...the one who spat in your face... He's disappeared. \n[123]If we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police... \n[124]Do you know where he is? \n[125]Edinburgh? \n[126]You can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. Explain Edinburgh. \n[127]...no, I couldn't get much sense out of him, he was drunk. \n[128]Mum, I don't want to tell you how I found him because I don't want another argument. I just wanted you to know he's definitely safe... \n[129]No, we can't tonight. I'm working. I need the money. For a place of my own, for Christ's sake! \n[130]They're from the morgue. They belonged to someone who died yesterday. \n[131]I can't believe I'm doing a favor for someone just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family. \n[132]Yeah.     It's OK. \n[133]No. \n[134]She's staying here for good. \n[135]Why do you care? \n[136]Stepan said you were kind to him. He said you were risking your own life to keep him alive. \n[137]Sonya! Is someone bathing Christine? \n[138]Well she's not. She's not. \n[139]What happened to the patient with the knife cuts? The Russian? \n[140]Where have they taken Christine?! \n[141]You bastards!! Where will he take her?! Tell me!! \n[142]Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine. I saw him here! I thought he was coming to see you, but he wasn't, was he? \n[143]I'll drive. \n[144]Kirill, let me take the baby. \n[145]She's cold, Kirill. \n[146]Who are you really? Why have you helped us? \n[147]There's someone I can call.   He'll come and fetch us. ", "SEMYON": "\n[1]We are closed. \n[2]Then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me, you have the wrong address. \n[3]Khitrova? \n[4]And his name? \n[5]So, you are Anna Ivanovna. \n[6]We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! Come on! \n[7]My angels. You should be practising. You must make the wood cry. Like this, like this... \n[8]You see... \n[9]Come, come, hurry, hurry.    They will be here any moment. Ok, show me this card. \n[10]It is the old card. From before the renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this. \n[11]So did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died? \n[12]This is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. Maybe you will have more luck there. But I think they will be closed until New Year. \n[13]Ten minutes!! Fish, fish, fish! Ten minutes! OK, Kirill, get him a drink and tell him I am coming. \n[14]Anna, I'm so sorry I couldn't help. It is sad. \n[15]Her diary? \n[16]Why did you not tell me you found a diary? \n[17]OK, Anna, this is how it will be. You will bring the diary here and I will translate it for you. Then if we get the names of any relatives I will call them myself. I am something of a... community leader for the Russians here in this unfriendly city. What do you say? \n[18]And when you come I will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the \n[19]fish with the sauce. OK? Tomorrow, yes? Shall we say seven? \n[20]Then it is settled. But for now, you must forgive me. \n[21]Dosvedania. \n[22]Oh Anna, you always work at the Trafalgar hospital? \n[23]Ah. My dear! I wasn't expecting you so early. \n[24]Where is the original? \n[25]I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it. \n[26]Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna? \n[27]Then maybe I can drive you home. \n[28]So what will happen to the poor child? \n[29]Who will? \n[30]Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed. \n[31]But you have had so many presents. \n[32]I know. \n[33]Who... the fuck... are you to tell me enough? \n[34]I hired you as a driver... \n[35]...someone to stop him killing himself. \n[36]I have no idea what business you're talking about. Now get out. \n[37]Hello Anna.     I came on tiptoes. \n[38]There are always open doors, Anna Ivanovna. \n[39]Please Anna, let me speak. \n[40]I translated the diary... \n[41]I was shocked to discover... that my son Kirill is mentioned many times. \n[42]I have known for some years that he has strayed from the path I set out for him. His mother died when he was very young. \n[43]Many bad things. \n[44]But Anna please. Let me deal with him. If the diary should find its way to the police... \n[45]Some of the things my son did are illegal. Anna, he is a good boy. \n[46]Of course.   Of course. And that is the baby? \n[47]Anna, I have made some inquiries and I have found out an address for Tatiana's family in Russia. That's where the baby belongs, no? \n[48]So... perhaps we can do a deal. \n[49]Do you understand me, Anna? \n[50]You know where I am, Anna Ivanovna. \n[51]And I know where you are. \n[52]Your friend Soyka is dead. \n[53]Don't lie to me!! \n[54]I said, don't lie to me! \n[55]I don't have to worry? \n[56]My son commits a murder? \n[57]On my own doorstep? A fellow soldier! And no one thought to tell me about it? \n[58]I decide what is right and what is wrong. You do not kill a vor for no reason. \n[59]For a driver, you are well informed. \n[60]Shut up! \n[61]If you are so well informed, you will know Soyka has brothers. \n[62]Get these boxes out of sight. \n[63]It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks. \n[64]In this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. You can't afford to be careless in any area. \n[65]Nasdrovia. \n[66]So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son? \n[67]Kirill had him killed for nothing important? \n[68]For me you will repeat it. \n[69]You play   with the Prince to do business   with the King. But if you want   to do business with me you must   be open with me. Thieves- in-law. \n[70]What was Soyka saying about the Prince? \n[71]My only son. \n[72]You know it never snows in this City. And it's never hot. London is a city of whores and queers. My son... \n[73]...I think London is to blame for what he is... \n[74]The cold gets into my bones. \n[75]And also... the KGB would be waiting for me. \n[76]Whatever they call them they are worse even than the KGB were. Maybe the KGB and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. We had rules, they had rules. \n[77]Now in Moscow, the thieves don't wear tattoos and the police don't wear uniforms. You never know who they are... \n[78]You've heard about these new policemen? \n[79]They get under you, over you, behind you, inside you. They are the ones you least expect. \n[80]The midwife said she had an uncle. A Russian. \n[81]So you know what he looks like. \n[82]She said he has read the diary. \n[83]We can't trust a Russian with that kind of information. \n[84]Do you understand me? \n[85]Perhaps you can deal with him. \n[86]So what did they say? \n[87]What did they say about my son? \n[88]You are being very honest. \n[89]Never again do business with any member of my family behind my back. \n[90]Do they know where to find Kirill? \n[91]Do they know what he looks like? \n[92]Then tell them you will deliver Kirill to them. \n[93]Tell them to give you two days. \n[94]She is one hundred years old. \n[95]Kirill, go down into the cellar and bring up some brandy. Twelve bottles. \n[96]No. He stays here.   I want to talk business. \n[97]Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take your time. \n[98]Did you deal with the old man? \n[99]It's time you joined us. \n[100]Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy. \n[101]You'll have a drink, Yuri... \n[102]Sometimes I don't believe you are really Russian. \n[103]Then have half a drink. \n[104]So what is all this nonsense? \n[105]For what? \n[106]He sits there like a vampire. \n[107]I am afraid of... conspiracies. \n[108]Wait.

His business is my business. \n[66]My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff. \n[67]Hey, don't feel bad. What happened up there is just how he is. He plays people against each other.

Go upstairs. \n[81]What did they want with you, papa? \n[82]Why would they want your blood, papa? \n[83]Maybe it's about the baby. \n[84]Some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby. \n[85]It was nothing. Just some bitch... \n[86]The woman from the hospital.   The midwife. \n[87]Hey, you stupid fucker!! \n[88]Be quiet baby. Quiet baby.
