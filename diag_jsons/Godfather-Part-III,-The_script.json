L\"tT-_.RROGATION ROOM TER= - DAY Tony sits in a chair in a small room with acoustical tile on the walls and ceiling. Behind hint is a desk- like structure with a built-in apparatus of dials, graph paper and odd, narrow metal pens. Tony is connected to the desk ensemble by three appara- tuses: a blood pressure cuff attached to his arm,. an accordian tube around the chest to measure changes in breathing rhythms; a hand-held device with electrodes which measures changes in perspiration or galvanic skin response. The Third Interrogator sits at the desk behind Tony, asking questions slowly and checking the three styluses on the rolling graphs. \n[23]No. \n[24]No. \n[25]Yes. \n[26]No. Save vou?

As Tony flicks the lighter on: \n[36]My name's Adams. Tony Adams. Z know who you are Miss Dunne. As Elizabeth finds a seat, we see that what is being run i.n this Projection room is an interview ime-troreen Elizabeth and a large, attractive, Latin-American political leader named Arnando. ?Tidal. They sit to- get er at the --col area of a lur..ar r hotel. Tidal wears a fatigue uni.fc= without any insignia whatsoever- The image of Elizabeth an screen is saving- \n[37]When will this be shown? \n[38]Right. There's a couple of ques- tions I wanted to ask you, if that's okay. What are you doing about lunch? \n[39]Sow did you guess h.at? \n[40]You're kidding. \n[41]None of my business, but what were you. doing at an Army-Navy ball. game? \n[42]You've got a pretty good memory. \n[43]You and Grundeilias? \n[44]Ee really gets around. \n[45]Oaps. \n[46]You stir see h,m? \n[47]Z was just going. \n[48]Goodnight. Tony goes down the street. She watches after him as we -\u00ab \n[49]How strong is the Corleone family connected in Latin America? \n[50]Tell me about the airline. It's what you call non-scheduled. You 'now? Lf we ever go out of business, haL \n[51]It's a political assassination. The target is Asmanda Vidal. \n[52]If it's too much for you, just say so. M can break this off right now --- Santino, taken aback at the cold authority in Tony's manner, turns for support. \n[53]Our Technical Services Division is experimenting in two areas. One is a scuba: diving wet suit designed to malfunction at a critical depth. The other is a toxic biological material -\u00bb- a strain of botulism that's tasteless, colorless and odorless -- and so lethal that one drop on his food or an his toothbrush would be fatal inside of an hour. \n[54]That's right. There's a second phase to this operation. It consists a spread- ing confusion -- planting explos- ives -- the Police Barracks -- the Central. Power Station -- so on. which will hopefully trigger an uprising of the Anti -Vi\"'aiista forces. \n[55]There's no problem there. Every- thing will be handled through me and in cash. \n[56]I don't know if they'll accept that. \n[57]No I don't. \n[58]No. \n[59]You might be right. \n[60]All right you, son of a bitch, tell me about it.. The Instructor is looking at Tony. Suddenly he grins; \n[61]Take a right on Sixteenth Street. \n[62]How's. your progress? \n[63]'Barcenas? \n[64]I' I L see you in Florida.. \n[65]Hiss Duane, please. \n[66]I believe I was next, Sir. The Admiral throws a look in Tony's direction, then pays for the bourbon and coke and exits. \n[67]Scotch-rocks. Here. Two.. \n[68]Finally. \n[69]On temporary assignment. \n[70]You'll be astonished. \n[71]Shh. \n[72]I don't know. \n[73]Don't make a noise. Just stand where you are or I'll kill you. We have pulled back and panned slightly to include Tony who is sitting on the. floor, his back against the wall. \n[74]S've got a. gun at your partner's head. There is 'a beat, then: \n[75]You drop the knife. \n[76]I'm going to give you one more chance. Trot the k:i-`f:a and !'I--l let you go . \n[77]That's what you're going to look like in two seconds if you harm that girl.. \n[78]Go get dressed and call the Police. Elizabeth nods and half-stumbles out of the room. Tony crosses to the Man. \n[79]No, I'm not. Tony lifts the gun and blasts the First Man three times in the chest. \n[80]It's all right.. He tried to get my gum away and I had to shoot him. As. Tony, still comforting her, moves her away, We -- \n[81]I'm pleased to meet you, Doctor. They shake hands, then:. \n[82]Are you read-!? \n[83]Yes. , \n[84]we got you BARS and Carbines plus ten, thirty calibre light machine guns, and ten, four-point t o inch mortars with a thousand rounds of high explosive and a thousand, rounds of white phosphorous. Tony is pointing out the various boxes and crates: \n[85]We also got you two hundred Sixty- six, millimeter, M-72 LAW rockets. They're lightweight, one-shot dis- posable Bazookas. There is also field gear, medical supplies, tentage, demolition mater- ials, combat rations --- Arrigo, the. pimp, comes up, takes the LAW rocket from Roberto, then: \n[86]You, go in tomorrow to get it ready. I'll meet you down there at the end of the week. Who's your radio man? \n[87]I'll show you the set up. As Tony and Padre Pepe move off together toward. a short wave radio set up in the corner, ae -- \n[88]Hi. She stops. Ee crosses up: \n[89]r thought you weren't coming down here. She doesn't answer. \n[90]Aren't we speaking? \n[91]Yes. \n[92]You've set a time?. \n[93]Good. \n[94]A hundred thousand pesos, cash. Count it, please. As Roberto takes up the money and counts it., Tony takes out a small vial in a plastic container. \n[95]And this. It's tasteless and odorless, but it has a vet-,,? short period of tox-- ic.Z. ty --- do you understand? Once s opened it must be used within twenty-four hours. \n[96]The symptoms are those of botulisat. High fever, nausea, vomiting, and death.

Palmateer Picks up a'Spanish language newspaper, idly scans it, \n[104]Sow many people know about t:-his mission? oAL.u.ATv-ZR Why? 78. \n[105]Z think there's been a leak in Washington. \n[106]is Artier Grundellius one of them? \n[107]F Then maybe it's not that serious. - \n[108]No. I think it's all right. See- you tomorrow.. \n[109]Yes? \n[110]Z don't know.. Tony turns and crosses out of the lobby as we --- \n[111]Then you're going to have to move right now. \n[112]Quick! Roberto runs in, whips out a knife and as Tony grabs the motionless body, the other cuts the line. \n[113]Get in. Tony is under the dashboard crossing the wires as the others start piling in. The motor starts, Tony slides behind the wheel. As they drive off --- \n[114]Which way? \n[115]Wait a minute. \n[116]Listen, I -- He breaks off as Elizabeth's face goes pale with shock and she drops the bag on the floor. A couple of oranges roll across the rug as: \n[117]I'm sorry, I had to talk to you She looks at him her expression almost readable as anger; \n[118]Bey, wait a minute He kisses her. \n[119]What's all. this crying shit? She smiles, sniffles, blinks the tears out of her eyes, \n[120]Stu? \n[121]Considering. Some friends of mine flew me up to Maryland this morning. I thought maybe I'd better not go directly home. \n[122]How are you? \n[123]Fes. \n[124]I hope you don't mind a house guest. \n[125]Wha_ is it? \n[126]Long distance =;fc_aa,ion, please. h T e number of the Ve?as ?alms --- \n[127]Maatrocina? \n[128]Who are you? \n[129]A little. \n[130]Did he say how soon T could leave? \n[131]r'd like to get out of here as soon as possible. \n[132]I'm not totally stupid. \n[133]t'n willing to learn. \n[134]Are 'you sure? Michael answers that question with a look: Of course in sure. \n[135]The girl I was staying with and --- Tony breaks off: \n[136]Before I left, I called a man named Stuart ?almateer.  106. \n[137]You were saying? \n[138]I I need your advice. \n[139]What's the other way? \n[140]Yes.. As Tony puts down the picture, Michael comes up. \n[141]Z remember that I loved him. \n[142]I've been thinking about these choices. Michael holds up his hand to delay the decision. \n[143]It's a special honors program for First Classmen. \n[144]No. Not that much. \n[145]I thought about it, but Kay wanted me to go to Annapolis and the price was right. \n[146]About the same. \n[147]I know. \n[148]Why didn't you do it? \n[149]is this so bad? Sa don't know. it depends or. what you call terrib? e . You have to \n[150]?redo, the fisherman. Yes. I'll always remember, he had a secret way to catch fish. 'He taught me. You say a Hail. Mary' before you put the line down. It never fails. \n[151]He died didn't he? \n[152]Why? \n[153]what I have to say won't take long. And I think we 111 all be happier if it's not on tape. Morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and switches ofd his tape machine. \n[154]I'm fine now. \n[155]Not as much as I' d. expected. \n[156]We're wasting each other's time with this, Mister Morehouse. \n[157]The big mistake was that I'm still alive. \n[158]11 you'd managed to get rid of me down there - or in Vegas -- you' d be all right. silt it's too Late now. You've lost your chance. \n[159]If anything should happen to me -- anything at all -- you can find out. The full story will be all over the six o'clock news. \n[160]You were running a no-lose operation. if we succeeded, you were rid of Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone family was set up to take the blame. Your hands were clean. I was the only one who could dispute your story and I wasn't supposed to come back. I've found out that my res- ignation from the Navy was processed and accepted a full week before I went down here --- \n[161]And I don't buy it. \n[162]It's not blackmail. It's a simple statement of fact. If anything happens to me or if the Corleone Family is damaged iz these Senate Hearings, then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces. ? \n[163]No. You've taken over the job. Your five minutes are up -- now get the hell out of here. As Tony turns and goes, Morehouse glares after him, the glint of victory in his eyes. \n[164]These are good. You ought to stave one. \n[165]First, I wanted to say that although I'm sure that I was set--um to be killed down there, I never thought you were mixed up in i t. \n[166]Z hear that Morehouse is being called in by the CommI tree to testify. \n[167]Well if he does -- and. I'm telling you this as a friend --- he's going to bring the roof down on him self --- and you too. As Pa.lmateer puts the newspaper down, looks at Tony: \n[168]That's definite, Stu.

As she locks at it: \n[3]as the fear comes up. Noses into the slip. Creak of pilings. The limousine drives onto the ferry. \n[4]Guns have appeared in the hands of the Puerto Ricans and they start to blast at the limousine from outside. The ferry whistle is blowing. \n[5]One of the Puerto Rican kids is hit squarely in the chest. He flies back, azms up, legs sz readea_gI d, like he was hit in the chest with a baseball bat. \n[6]The services finish and the group breaks into smaller informal, groupings. We move to Tom Hagen and Tony, who have drifted to one side. aNOTH.ER ANGLE as Hagen indicates a moon-faced man, Imberto Croce, about sixty, who is approaching them. \n[7]As Rocco Lamm pone comes up, clearly agitated: \n[8]The Instructor offers a tempting target. Tony swings. The Instructor slaps his cap across Tony's face, grabs Tony's wrist and disarms him, throwing him to the ground. \n[9]Tony rolls to his feet, grabs up the killing knife and presses it to the Instrutor's throat. \n[10]As Tony comes into the room, Palmateer gives him a pen and a couple of pieces of paper. \n[11]Tony has heard this last. \n[12]as Elizabeth swings out of bed, naked, crossing out of the bedroom and into the hall. \n[13]As a. Second Man appears. This one has a gun. The First Man turns to him, speaking in a whisper. \n[14]As: the Second Man stands motionless, Tony is on. his feet and up to him. Tony takes the qua from him and tossing it an the bed gestures, forefinger to lips, be quiet. Now, Tony turns to the Man and. starts down the hall with him. Tony has him by the back of the jacket, his Tun pressed against the back of the Second Man's head. \n[15]as Elizabeth bursts bac k into the room, looks, then starts to scream. Tony crosses up and taking her in his arms, softly comforts her. \n[16]Eagen comes around his desk to the door to greet Maatrocina as he enters, followed closely by the cold-looking Ralph Augusto. \n[17]As Lampone crosses to the window to watch Augusto and Maatrocina leave through the pool area below, Hagen moves to Danny DeVito. \n[18]As Devito grins, shakes hands around and exits, Hagen turns to Santino. \n[19]As the predominantly Latin American crowd cheers, we pick out Tony, in civilian clothes, amongst. the' cheer- ing people. \n[20]As Anjelica turns, her coat swings open slightly and we see that she is dressed in a costume.-- a typical Tropicana showgirl kind of thing. \n[21]as Jorge, Tony and-Roberto all `ire at the same time, blowing Magudo back down the basement stairs. Tony and the others dive down the stairs. \n[22]As Borracho, Pepe and.Fararon run into the Presidential Palace, somebody has started pealing the bells of the Cathedral. \n[23]As E'ararcn cuts the Soldier down, then turns to Pepe: \n[24]as Pepe and Fararon disappear into the darkness follow- ed by Tony, Roberto and Jorge. \n[25]Pepe runs up, looks in. Tony and the others follow. \n[26]Roberto has broken off as he looks at-Fararon. We realize that sometime during the chase the Pharoah has taken a bullet in the chest. Se's dying, and pink bubbles of blood fora and break on his lips as he stiizggles for breath. \n[27]as Jorge, Pepe and Roberto run to the center of the airstrip, looking upward. We can hear the sound of an approaching aircraft. \n[28]as limousines 4ith soldiers on the ;enders and roofs come inching through the fist-waving, threatening mob. As the gates are opened, Soldiers with bayoneted rifles force the crowds back so that the cars can get through, \n[29]as Augusta, Danny Devito and the Chauffeur move up toward the rear of the truck, the Laborer jumps down off the big barrel he's been sitting on. \n[30]As the Television Newscaster switches to another item, we see a burning house, fire engines, so on. \n[31]as Rocco Lampcne crosses up to him. \n[32]as the Corleone Button Men in the following car blasts at the attackers, the Shotgun Man blasts away. \n[33]As Tony sits. He's not sure whether he likes or trusts or is ready to forgive his father, but he knows the sound of good sense when he hears it. \n[34]Michael takes out a cigar and goes about the ceremony of lighting it. \n[35]There is a beat. To= and his father look at each other and for a moment we feel that Tony is going to cross to his father, then the moment passes: \n[36]As Maatrocina goes to his knees, his eyes goggling, the First Young Man has crosses to the window and opened it. Now he and the Second Young Man carry the wide-eyed New York Don to the window and throw him out. \n[37]As Morehouse's sailboat drifts in the calm, it's sails up and motionless, it's tiller untended.

I've got to pick up some shots around town, but you're welcome to come along. They are at the projection: room door. As Tony cpens it for her she causes, then: \n[3]I saw you pitch a no-hitter against Army two years ago. \n[4]We were putting together a special on Arne Grundellius.

It's just a policy decision of the Board. \n[9]What's that supposed to mean? \n[10]What am t supposed to do? Get scared? Piss in my pants? ,,To one is trfing to intimidate you. The Corleone :\u00b0 ti.ly doesn't do business that wacr, \n[11]a hell of a lot of business, period. The way Z hear it, you're finished. With Mike locked away in a rubber room someplace, and a two million dollar tax lein on your Vegas prop- erty, you. got the balls to come in here and try to run muscle on me. Get out of here. Both of you. \n[12]Wait a minute. Hagen turns back. Brady comes up with the Genco Inte.r- national loan application. \n[13]Take this along with you in case you run out of toilet paper on 0 the flight back to Vegas. 3agen takes the application from Brady, then cuietly: E ,Gr 3 Don't ever think that the Corleone Tamily is finished, Mister Brady. That would be a mistake. Hagen and Neri now turn and exit. Brady is looking after them. Gradually the bravado drains from his big, pink, Irish face and he crosses to the telephone and picks it up. \n[14]Gat me Sam Maatrocina. \n[15]Still shopping around for that loan. \n[16]Thank you, Ralph. Augusta, having lit Brady's cigar, nods expression- lessly and sits as: \n[17]Something about Hagen kind of bothered me. Maatrocina offers a platter of grapes to Brady. \n[18]No thank you. \n[19]Yeah? What about Al Neri? ", "MICHAEL": "\n[1]The Doctor says it's nothing.to bother you, but I've always found it's easier to be brave about some- body else's headache. \n[2]Let me ask you a question. Have you any idea where you stand? \n[3]I aC 't think you're stupid. I think you're smart. 3 t not smart enough. \n[4]Good. You've let your enemies get too close to you. Those people who tried to kill you in Las Vegas, they were Maatrocina's people. \n[5]I told Tom Hagen -- God rest his soul --- but I warned him. it was a. mistake -- that whole Vidal business. As the only contact between our people and the Government you had no protec- tion. You were naked. It they want to break the contact, they elimirate you and they're clean. As long as you're alive,. you're a threat -- do you understand? \n[6]How long do you think the-Administra- tion would last if it were to come out that the President used the Corleone family to assassinate the head of a foreign state.

But, neverthe- less, I'm your lather and anything t have is yours - if it's money you want, my friendship, the benefit of my experience -- if you'll accept it.

In four or five years you could probably be safe to come home again.. \n[9]Think about it. Sleep on it. We'll talk again in the morning. \n[10]2 was surprised you didn't go to Dartmouth. \n[11]How's Hanover these days? \n[12]I always liked that town. That' S where Z met your mother -- when I was going to school up there. \n[13]Because one day a Sicilian pimp and dope peddlar named Virgil Solla2 O tried to assassinate my father -- your grandfather -- and I had to do something about it.
