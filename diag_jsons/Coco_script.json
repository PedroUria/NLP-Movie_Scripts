{"dialogues": {"MIGUEL": "\n[1]Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born. \n[2]See, a long time ago there was this family. \n[3]The pap\u00e1, he was a musician. \n[4]He and his family would sing, and dance, and count their blessings... But he also had a dream... to play for the world. And one day he left with his guitar... and never returned. \n[5]And the mam\u00e1...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! After banishing all music from her life... \n[6]She found a way to provide for her daughter... She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. She could have made candy! \n[7]Or fireworks! \n[8]Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers! \n[9]But no... she chose shoes... \n[10]Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. \n[11]Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. \n[12]Music had torn her family apart, but shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great- great grandmother, Mam\u00e1 Imelda. \n[13]She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on D\u00eda de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... And her little girl? \n[14]She's my great grandmother, Mam\u00e1 Coco. \n[15]Hol\u00e1, Mam\u00e1 Coco. \n[16]Actually, my name is Miguel. Mam\u00e1 Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything. \n[17]I used to run like this... \n[18]But now I run like this which is way faster! \n[19]And the winner is... Luchadora Coco! \n[20]I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side. Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple-- \n[21]My Abuelita? She's Mam\u00e1 Coco's daughter. \n[22]No, gracias. \n[23]S-s\u00ed? \n[24]Abuelita runs our house just like Mam\u00e1 Imelda did. \n[25]I think we're the only family in M\u00e9xico who hates music... \n[26]And my family's fine with that... \n[27]But me? \n[28]Love you, Mam\u00e1! \n[29]I am NOT like the rest of my family... \n[30]Hola! \n[31]Muchas gracias! \n[32]Hey, hey!    Dante! \n[33]Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake. Fist bump. \n[34]Good boy, Dante! \n[35]I know I'm not supposed to love music -- but it's not my fault! It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz... \n[36]...The greatest musician of all time. \n[37]He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. \n[38]He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly! \n[39]And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It's-- \n[40]He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942... \n[41]When he was crushed by a giant bell. \n[42]I wanna be just like him. \n[43]Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too... \n[44]...If it wasn't for my family. \n[45]Huh? \n[46]Oh, yeah, sorry. \n[47]I just can't really talk about any of this at home so... \n[48]I could never say that... \n[49]I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself-- \n[50]Uh-uh, my family would freak! \n[51]...Seize your moment? \n[52]Abuelita! \n[53]Um...uh... \n[54]He was just showing me his guitar... \n[55]Yes, T\u00edo Berto. \n[56]No, no, no! \n[57]It's just Dante... \n[58]I was just shining shoes! \n[59]But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. \n[60]But what about tonight? \n[61]Well they're having this talent show- \n[62]And I thought I might... \n[63]Well, maybe? \n[64]I thought we were done... \n[65]Like Mam\u00e1 Coco's pap\u00e1? \n[66]But you're the one who-- \n[67]I was just-- \n[68]But-- \n[69]\n[70]Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up. \n[71]You're gonna get me in trouble, boy. Someone could hear me! \n[72]I wish someone wanted to hear me... \n[73]Other than you... \n[74]Perfecto! \n[75]...and make it come true. \n[76]No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta seize my moment! \n[77]I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me! \n[78]Get under, get under! \n[79]Nothing! \n[80]Mam\u00e1 -- Pap\u00e1, I-- \n[81]What?! \n[82]But what if I'm no good at making shoes? \n[83]...A shoemaker. Through and through. \n[84]Dante!   No, Dante, stop! \n[85]No, no, no, no, no! No... \n[86]De la Cruz's guitar...? \n[87]Mam\u00e1 Coco, is your pap\u00e1... Ernesto de la Cruz? \n[88]Ha, ha! \n[89]Pap\u00e1!   Pap\u00e1! \n[90]It's him! I know who my great- great grandfather was! \n[91]Mam\u00e1 Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz! \n[92]I'm gonna be a musician! \n[93]It's not a fantasy! \n[94]That man was Ernesto de la Cruz! The greatest musician of all time! \n[95]But Pap\u00e1, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music! \n[96]If you would just let-- \n[97]Just listen to me play-- \n[98]I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda! \n[99]No! \n[100]I don't wanna be in this family! \n[101]I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up? \n[102]No... But if I can borrow a guitar-- \n[103]Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar? \n[104]You guys have a spare guitar? \n[105]I need a guitar, just for a little bit-- \n[106]Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do? \n[107]No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! C\u00e1llate! Shhh! \n[108]I'm sorry... \n[109]Se\u00f1or de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this. \n[110]Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! \n[111]So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did! \n[112]I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my... \n[113]Mam\u00e1! \n[114]Thanks, I-- \n[115]Ahhh! \n[116]\n[117]Dante?! You can see me?          W-wait! What's going on?! \n[118]Dante!    Dante! \n[119]I'm sorry, I'm sorry... \n[120]Remind me how I know you? \n[121]T\u00eda... Rosita? \n[122]Pap\u00e1 Julio? \n[123]T\u00eda Victoria? \n[124]T\u00edo Oscar?     T\u00edo Felipe? \n[125]Whoa... \n[126]Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up! \n[127]You gotta stay with me, boy.       We don't know... where... \n[128]This isn't a dream, then.        You're all really out there... \n[129]Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins. \n[130]Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be... \n[131]Are those...? Alebrijes!         But those are-- \n[132]Hola. \n[133]Whoa... \n[134]Mam\u00e1 Imelda... \n[135]What?! \n[136]But I wasn't stealing the guitar! \n[137]It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it-- \n[138]Uh, you're all dead. \n[139]That's just Dante. \n[140]But Dante doesn't have any hair. \n[141]Oh... \n[142]It was an accident! \n[143]That's it? \n[144]What happens at sunrise? \n[145]What?   She can't do that! \n[146]Fine. \n[147]No skeletons! \n[148]Mariachi Plaza, here I come-- \n[149]This isn't fair, it's my life!     You already had yours! \n[150]Pap\u00e1 Julio, I ask for your blessing. \n[151]T\u00eda Rosita? Oscar? Felipe?       T\u00eda Victoria? \n[152]You really hate music that much? \n[153]The same path he did. \n[154]He's family... \n[155]Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back! \n[156]V\u00e1monos. \n[157]If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa. \n[158]No, no -- Dante! \n[159]Hey. Hey!     You really know de la Cruz? \n[160]Shhh! \n[161]Yeah I'm alive. And if I wanna get back to the Land of the Living, I need de la Cruz's blessing. \n[162]He's my great-great-grandfather. \n[163]D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g-- \n[164]\n[165]That's nice! \n[166]You don't get to cross over. \n[167]This is you? \n[168]So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home? \n[169]Mmm, nope. \n[170]ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. \n[171]I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. \n[172]It's how you walk. \n[173]Whoa...\"Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!\" Qu\u00e9 padre! \n[174]And you can get us in! \n[175]Hey, you said you had front row tickets! \n[176]How? \n[177]Hola. \n[178]Dante... Dante! \n[179]We shouldn't be in here... \n[180]No, no, Dante! Ven ac\u00e1! \n[181]I just followed my-- \n[182]I don't think he's a spirit guide. \n[183]I think it's just the right amount of obvious? It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk... \n[184]Oh! And then it could go dittle- ittle-dittle-ittle-dittle-ittle- dittle-ittle -- WHAAA! \n[185]Huh? \n[186]Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? \n[187]You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party. \n[188]If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? \n[189]Chorizo? \n[190]Hey, I'm a musician. \n[191]I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. \n[192]You know where I can get a guitar? \n[193]My great-great grandpa was a musician. \n[194]Whadda you know? \n[195]So, how far is this guitar anyway? \n[196]These people are all your family? \n[197]Wait... what happened? \n[198]Where did he go? \n[199]But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back... \n[200]You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one. \n[201]No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time? \n[202]You don't know what you're talking about... \n[203]Definitely \"Remember Me.\" \n[204]C'mon, it's his most popular song! \n[205]Um... what about \"Poco Loco?\" \n[206]I don't know -- I've never performed before. \n[207]I am! I mean I will be.     Once I win. \n[208]No!    I need to do this. \n[209]If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician? \n[210]'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it. \n[211]My best grito? \n[212]Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay... \n[213]H\u00e9ctor... \n[214]\n[215]\n[216]\n[217]Not bad for a dead guy! \n[218]\n[219]We gotta get outta here. \n[220]I do have other family, but-- \n[221]--But they hate music!      I need a musician's blessing! \n[222]Oh, you're one to talk! \n[223]It's not stupid. \n[224]Let go of me! \n[225]You don't wanna help me, you only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo! \n[226]Stay away from me! \n[227]Dante, c\u00e1llate! \n[228]No, Dante!     Stop it! He can't help me! \n[229]Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! \n[230]\n[231]I don't want your blessing! \n[232]You're ruining my life! \n[233]Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away! You'll never understand. \n[234]I thought you hated music. \n[235]But I don't wanna... pick sides! Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. But you never will. \n[236]It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson! \n[237]Disculpen, se\u00f1ores... \n[238]You too! Hey, musician to musician, I need a favor... \n[239]Thanks guys! \n[240]Whoa... \n[241]Gracias! \n[242]De la Cruz... \n[243]Se\u00f1or de la Cruz! \n[244]Pardon me, Se\u00f1or de la Cruz!     Se\u00f1or de la-- \n[245]Se\u00f1or de la Cruz!     Se\u00f1or de la-- \n[246]\n[247]\n[248]\n[249]You... know about me? \n[250]I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson. \n[251]I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you. \n[252]The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would? \n[253]Dimple.   No dimple.      Dimple.   No dimple. \n[254]No -- it's all great. \n[255]It's just -- I've been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But... Did you ever regret it? Choosing music over... everything else. \n[256]Leaving your family? \n[257]You mean it?! \n[258]I can't... I have to get home before sunrise. \n[259]I just met him tonight.      He told me he knew you-- \n[260]W-What? \n[261]That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs. \n[262]You really did play together... \n[263]Heaven and earth?     Like in the movie? \n[264]That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, \"El Camino A Casa.\" \n[265]No, it's in there.    Look. \n[266]But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink... \n[267]H\u00e9ctor! \n[268]You were going to give me your blessing... \n[269]That you murdered H\u00e9ctor... for his songs? \n[270]I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy. \n[271]Pap\u00e1 Ernesto? My blessing? \n[272]What?!    But I'm your family! \n[273]No, NO! \n[274]Let go! \n[275]\n[276]Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna go home! \n[277]H\u00e9ctor? \n[278]Oh, H\u00e9ctor! \n[279]You were right. I should have gone back to my family-- \n[280]They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen-- \n[281]I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda. \n[282]I told them I didn't care. \n[283]H\u00e9ctor!   H\u00e9ctor-- \n[284]Who? \n[285]She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge... \n[286]Coco? \n[287]That's my Mam\u00e1 Coco. That's my Mam\u00e1 Imelda. Is that... you? \n[288]You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her... \n[289]He stole your guitar... He stole your songs... \n[290]You should be the one the world remembers, not de la Cruz! \n[291]Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade! \n[292]My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from. But now I know. It comes from you. I'm proud we're family! \n[293]I'm proud to be his family! \n[294]Dante? \n[295]Dante!    It's Dante! \n[296]Dante, you knew he was my Pap\u00e1 H\u00e9ctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide! Who's a good spirit guide? You are! \n[297]Whoa... \n[298]Dante! \n[299]I wasn't in there `cause of H\u00e9ctor. He was in there `cause of me. He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family. \n[300]I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get H\u00e9ctor's photo. \n[301]So he can see Coco again.        H\u00e9ctor should be on our ofrenda.        He's part of our family-- \n[302]He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him! \n[303]H\u00e9ctor? \n[304]You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him. \n[305]Family comes first. \n[306]I might know a way... \n[307]Gracias Frida! \n[308]Ow! \n[309]Everyone clear on the plan? \n[310]She's talking about me! \n[311]The photo! \n[312]That's what I heard... \n[313]Hurry, come on! \n[314]Sing! \n[315]\n[316]Ahem. \n[317]Never play music again... \n[318]Dante! \n[319]You're a coward! \n[320]H\u00e9ctor's the real musician, you're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs! \n[321]\n[322]Good boy, Dante. \n[323]H\u00e9ctor!   The photo, I lost it... \n[324]H\u00e9ctor!    H\u00e9ctor?! \n[325]No!   We can still find the photo... \n[326]No, no, no, I can't leave you. I promised I'd put your photo up. I promised you'd see Coco! \n[327]No, no... she can't forget you! \n[328]H\u00e9ctor-- \n[329]No, Pap\u00e1 H\u00e9ctor, please! \n[330]No... \n[331]I promise I won't let Coco forget you! Aaahh!-- \n[332]Ah! I need to see Mam\u00e1 Coco, please-- \n[333]Mam\u00e1 Coco?     Can you hear me?   It's Miguel. \n[334]I saw your pap\u00e1. Remember? Pap\u00e1? Please -- if you forget him, he'll be gone... forever! \n[335]Here -- this was his guitar, right? He used to play it to you? See, there he is. \n[336]Pap\u00e1, remember? Pap\u00e1? \n[337]Mam\u00e1 Coco, please, don't forget him. \n[338]I'm sorry, Pap\u00e1. \n[339]Not all of us... \n[340]Mam\u00e1 Coco... \n[341]Mam\u00e1 Coco? Your pap\u00e1 -- he wanted you to have this. \n[342]\n[343]\n[344]\n[345]He loved you, Mam\u00e1 Coco.         Your pap\u00e1 loved you so much. \n[346]And that man is your Pap\u00e1 Julio... \n[347]...And there's T\u00eda Rosita... and your T\u00eda Victoria... and those two are Oscar and Felipe. These aren't just old pictures -- they're our family -- and they're counting on us to remember them. \n[348]\n[349]\n[350]\n[351]\n[352]\n[353]\n[354]", "H\u00c9CTOR": "\n[1]Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie... \n[2]Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that. \n[3]You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone. \n[4]Ha HA! \n[5]Almost there, just a little further...! \n[6]Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge! \n[7]That's illegal? \n[8]Amigo? Oh, that's so nice, to hear you say that, because... I've just had a really hard D\u00eda de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now. \n[9]And amigos, they help their amigos. Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight and I'll make it worth your while. \n[10]Oh, you like de la Cruz? He and I go way back! I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular Show! \n[11]I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him! You just gotta let me cross that bridge! \n[12]Can I at least get my costume back? \n[13]Some amigo... \n[14]Who wants to-- Ah! You're alive! \n[15]That's weirdly specific. \n[16]He's your wha-whaat...? \n[17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait... Wait, no, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait? Yes! You're going back to the Land of the Living?! \n[18]No, ni\u00f1o, ni\u00f1o, ni\u00f1o, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME. \n[19]I'm H\u00e9ctor. \n[20]Esp\u00e9rame chamaco! \n[21]Hey, hey, hold still. Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da! \n[22]Dead as a doorknob. So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on D\u00eda de Muertos. Unless you're me. \n[23]No one's ever put up my picture... But you can change that! \n[24]Muy guapo, eh? \n[25]Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible? \n[26]Don't yank my chain, chamaco.      You gotta have SOME other family. \n[27]Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...! \n[28]...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. What are you doing? \n[29]No, skeletons don't walk like that. \n[30]No, I don't. \n[31]Stop it! \n[32]Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of D\u00eda de Muertos. \n[33]Ahhhh-- \n[34]That... that was a lie.      I apologize for that. \n[35]Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him. \n[36]'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing! \n[37]Hola, Ceci! \n[38]Ceci, I lost the dress-- \n[39]Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci... \n[40]Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities... \n[41]That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? \n[42]He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How come he didn't invite YOU? \n[43]Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party? \n[44]Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very funny. \n[45]I don't want to talk about it. \n[46]I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference! \n[47]This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks! \n[48]You are? \n[49]No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think-- \n[50]I know a guy... \n[51]Why the heck would you wanna be a musician? \n[52]...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, gu\u00e1cala, no... \n[53]We're almost there... \n[54]Keep up, chamaco, come on! \n[55]Eh!   These guys! \n[56]Hey T\u00edo!   Qu\u00e9 onda! \n[57]Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know? So, we all call each other cousin, or t\u00edo, or whatever. \n[58]T\u00eda Chelo!

I brought you a little offering! \n[63]I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar. \n[64]Yes? \n[65]I promise we'll bring it right back. \n[66]Uh... \n[67]Ah, you see\u00ad- \n[68]No, no, not like those times. \n[69]Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo? \n[70]You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid-- \n[71]Only for you, amigo.     Any requests? \n[72]\n[73]\n[74]There are children present. \n[75]He's been forgotten. When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the \"Final Death.\" \n[76]No one knows. \n[77]No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories... \n[78]Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. \n[79]C'mon \"de la Cruzcito.\" You've got a contest to win. \n[80]How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. \n[81]Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much. \n[82]Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz! Showtime, chamaco! \n[83]That's our ticket, muchacho. \n[84]So what's the plan?     What are you gonna play? \n[85]No, not that one.     No. \n[86]Ehck, it's too popular. \n[87]Epa!   Now that's a song! \n[88]You always this nervous before a performance? \n[89]What?! You said you were a musician! \n[90]That's your plan?! No, no, no, no, no, you have to win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE \n[91]I'll go up there-- \n[92]Why? \n[93]What does that matter?! \n[94]Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time! \n[95]Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM! \n[96]First you have to loosen up.     Shake off those nerves! S\u00e1quenlo s\u00e1quenlo, s\u00e1quenlo! \n[97]Now gimme your best grito! \n[98]Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you. \n[99]Oh, c'mon kid... \n[100]Miguel, look at me. \n[101]Hey!     Hey, look at me. \n[102]You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go! \n[103]Make 'em listen, chamaco!        You got this! \n[104]Arre pap\u00e1!     Hey! \n[105]What's he doing? Why isn't he playing? \n[106]No, no, no, no... \n[107]You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso! \n[108]\n[109]Hey, you did good!     I'm proud of you! Eso! \n[110]Hey, where are you going? \n[111]What, are you crazy?     We're about to win this thing! \n[112]Wait, wait, wait! You said de la Cruz was your ONLY family. The ONLY person who could send you home. \n[113]You could have taken my photo back this whole time?! \n[114]You lied to me! \n[115]Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night! I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge 'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy! \n[116]I'm taking you to your family. \n[117]You'll thank me later-- \n[118]No -- no, no, no!     No... \n[119]Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?! Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back! \n[120]Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. \n[121]Gracias... \n[122]We had a deal, chamaco! \n[123]You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel. \n[124]Please Miguel, put my photo up. \n[125]And whose fault is that? \n[126]Those were MY songs you took.     MY songs that made YOU famous. \n[127]If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them-- \n[128]You wanna tell him, or should I? \n[129]Oh, how generous. \n[130]Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up-- \n[131]--And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. \n[132]Ernesto... Remember the night I left? \n[133]We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now. \n[134]What? \n[135]I'm talking about my real life, Miguel. \n[136]That night, Ernesto.    The night I left... \n[137]We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick -- and I packed up my songs... \n[138]You walked me to the train station. \n[139]But I felt a pain in my stomach. I thought it must have been something I ate... \n[140]Or something I... drank. \n[141]I woke up dead. \n[142]You... POISONED me. \n[143]All this time I thought it was just bad luck. \n[144]I never thought that you might have... that you... \n[145]How could you?! \n[146]You took everything away from me! \n[147]You rat! \n[148]I just wanted to go back home!      No, no, NO! \n[149]Kid? \n[150]Hey -- hey, hey... \n[151]Hey, it's okay... \n[152]Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's okay. \n[153]Hhuuh! \n[154]She's... forgetting me. \n[155]My daughter... \n[156]I just wanted to see her again... I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her pap\u00e1 was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. My Coco... \n[157]Where... where did you get this? \n[158]We're... \n[159]I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. You know the worst part? Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world... \n[160]...Ever again. \n[161]You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time. \n[162]\n[163]\n[164]I didn't write \"Remember Me\" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa. \n[165]\n[166]Imelda! \n[167]You look good... \n[168]Imelda-- \n[169]It's true, Imelda. \n[170]Imelda, I-- \n[171]I'm running out of time.

Leave the boy alone! \n[181]He's a living child, Ernesto! \n[182]\n[183]It's okay, mijo. It's-- \n[184]Coco... \n[185]We're both out of time, mijo. \n[186]I just wanted her to know that I loved her. \n[187]You have our blessing, Miguel. \n[188]Go home... \n[189]Coco!
