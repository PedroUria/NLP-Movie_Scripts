{"dialogues": {"CHRIS": "\n[1]Yes, sir. \n[2]Can it see me? \n[3]The guy was picking on Jeff. \n[4]You're supposed to get laid with it. I'm gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood. \n[5]Is that what they say? \n[6]Don't say it. \n[7]Who wants to hump a rodeo star? \n[8]What the fuck-- \n[9]Why would you do this? \n[10]You didn't know? \n[11]Get out. \n[12]But she was right... \n[13]Jeff, wake up. Look at this-- \n[14]Look what they did... \n[15]I saw what they did, on our soil, and-- \n[16]Yes, sir. But I can't see myself on a ship. I'd wanna be in the fight-- \n[17]I ain't much of a swimmer-- \n[18]I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit. \n[19]30, sir. \n[20]No, sir. \n[21]I love water, hooyah. \n[22]Two hundred. \n[23]No, sir. \n[24]--and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something. And I'm a virgin, I don't know what to do, but I'd heard if you pour Coke up there you won't get pregnant-- So we went to 7-11, got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods. She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring, she starts screaming, \"it stings, it stings\" but when I'd stop, she'd scream \"no don't stop\" and it's fizzing out and-- \n[25]I'm gonna try and get into sniper school. \n[26]I can hunt. And what's cooler than being a sniper? \n[27]It could be the leather pants. \n[28]Corduroy. \n[29]Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth. \n[30]I'm no redneck, I'm a Texan. \n[31]We ride horses, they ride their cousins. \n[32]I polish dolphins. They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates. \n[33]To be honest, you look a little sad. \n[34]So am I tall enough to buy you a drink? \n[35]How about this: one shot, one answer. \n[36]I'm just finishing BUD/S. \n[37]That was two questions... \n[38]What's that mean you know all about us? \n[39]How can you say we're self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country. \n[40]Cause it's the greatest country on earth and I believe it's worth protecting. I'm sorry this guy hurt your sister but that's not me. Nice talking to you. \n[41]You said you'd never date a SEAL, so I'm going home. \n[42]Well in that case... what's your name? \n[43]Nice to meet you, Taya. I'm Chris Kyle. \n[44]Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego, liquor, and women. \n[45]It's me again. The guy whose shoes you puked on? I was thinking maybe you didn't get my last message. Or the one before that. So, I figured-- \n[46]I wanted to be a cowboy-- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more. \n[47]I rescued that bar from you. \n[48]Do you like country music? \n[49]You want kids? \n[50]That's a shitty thing to tell a girl. \n[51]But those wrong picks put you here. They made you who you are. And I like who you are. \n[52]I don't know... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes. \n[53]Check. I'm dialed for windage. \n[54]You're trembling... \n[55]We don't have to do this... \n[56]If I close my off-eye I can't see what's out there. \n[57]Negative. There's something-- \n[58]There it is. \n[59]I know enough. You're a package deal, babe. \n[60]What are you afraid of? \n[61]I'm going to marry you, and we're going to start a family. \n[62]I love you. I'm done. \n[63]Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago? \n[64]Package deal babe. \n[65]They say it'll be over in 6 weeks. \n[66]Don't be afraid. It's all part of the plan. \n[67]I'm not the only one going to war. \n[68]A sniper won't aim for your head. \n[69]They got sniping in the Olympics now? \n[70]You ever hunt? \n[71]You just got your first kill, Goat. \n[72]I'm going to the roof. You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals. \n[73]Get the fuck off me. \n[74]That was sniper fire. Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street. Over. \n[75]That sniper walked right up our ass. \n[76]My shooter statements are on the dresser. \n[77]Should be eight. Two got dragged off. Something wrong? \n[78]They still got one of our guys. \n[79]Where is everybody? \n[80]Why ain't you out there? \n[81]You still read comic books? \n[82]This kid didn't even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade-- sends him running off to kill Marines. \n[83]It was evil, man. That was hate like I've never seen it before. \n[84]I know. \n[85]It's just not how you imagine the first one going down. \n[86]The other ones-- were righteous. Like God was blowing on my bullets. \n[87]By every kill, do you mean just our kills or you're monitoring the bad guys too? \n[88]Sorry, was that a question? \n[89]I got a armed military-aged male moving tactically with a car battery. Maybe he needs a jump? \n[90]Well, I don't know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying-- it was pressed metal, fired 7.62s and looked just like an AK-47. \n[91]That's not how the call-home goes, babe. \n[92]There are things we can't say over the phone. \n[93]I can't stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon... \n[94]Yeah-- \n[95]It was a good three days. I miss you bad. \n[96]Yeah. But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other-- \n[97]You're horny preggers. \n[98]You could be 300 pounds I'd still do you. \n[99]How's my boy? \n[100]I can't wait to see the way you are with him. You're gonna be incredible. \n[101]I just know. I can see it. \n[102]I haven't checked any email. \n[103]What happened? \n[104]Taya. \n[105]What happened to jump school? I thought-- \n[106]Deployed where? Where's he going? \n[107]These Marines rush in like they been doing, they'll get their asses shot off. \n[108]So let's coach them up. I'll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street. \n[109]But if I was down in the street-- \n[110]I just wanna get the bad guys. And I can't shoot them if I can't see `em. \n[111]They're not-- \n[112]You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics-- but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in the last three games. \n[113]Once you make entry I can't see shit, so keep it slow and push through the target. \n[114]Fuck this-- I'm going down to clear houses with the Marines. You coming? \n[115]If I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again. \n[116]You wanna be a sniper? Swap me guns. \n[117]I'll roll with you guys if that's cool? \n[118]It's 32. But who's counting. \n[119]Down. Down! On the floor, now! \n[120]I will fucking shoot you! Down! Get down-- \n[121]You were ordered to evacuate. Why are you still here? \n[122]Who will know we've spoken? \n[123]Bring the other guys in. \n[124]Who is he? I need a name. \n[125]So he's some kind of enforcer? \n[126]We want Zarqawi. Where do we find Zarqawi? \n[127]How do we find him? \n[128]We don't even have proof this guy exists. \n[129]I'm sorry. I want to help you. I do. But I need names, places, phone numbers-- \n[130]Give me a name, Sheik. Give me something. \n[131]Yes sir, it does. \n[132]Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife's hand. Either way, seems like you'd wanna explore it. \n[133]But you don't know his real name or you'd have it written up there. \n[134]If we're going back out, TEAM 3 could pull security-- \n[135]Why didn't you? \n[136]My kind of preacher. \n[137]Minaret, 11 o'clock! \n[138]You got eyes on that? \n[139]Eyes on The Butcher. He's got that Sheikh's kid in the street-- \n[140]Fuck!-- \n[141]I'm gonna pop smoke for cover but don't move till I say. \n[142]Hold. \n[143]Holding! Hold... \n[144]Move now. Go-- \n[145]Cause I'd wait. \n[146]Go around. I'll go high. \n[147]Hears the drill and Omar's screams. He'll be exposed but-- HE POPS UP to shoot The Butcher. Before he can get set-- A SNIPER ROUND clips his helmet. He's knocked flat-back. Clouds strobe overhead. The dog barks viciously inches from his face. Saliva flying off incisors as-- \n[148]Rage animates him. He staggers to his feet, FIRING HIS M4 on the minaret until the clip expires. Then-- A FLUTTER of cloth sweeps across an alley a block north. MUSTAFA slows, rounding the corner, and glances back-- Chris draws his .45, but Mustafa slips into the shadows. Women sob over dead bodies in the street below. \n[149]We need to work up a squad to pursue him. \n[150]What do you mean? \n[151]Can he do that? Just shelf us like that? I ship home in three weeks. \n[152]Shh. I'm know. I'm so sorry. \n[153]You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. \n[154]Our bedroom. \n[155]If it catches the light... \n[156]They're mine. I swear... \n[157]I'm nervous too. \n[158]I am... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me? \n[159]Huh?-- \n[160]Maybe we just relax here? \n[161]Not really. \n[162]I'm just happy to be home. \n[163]If you wanna help, you should be looking at my knees. I don't know what I did but-- \n[164]No, ma'am. \n[165]Only when I'm thirsty. \n[166]Is that high? \n[167]I'll look into it. Thanks doc. \n[168]You sabotaged me back there. \n[169]It is okay. I'm fine. \n[170]Babe, I'm driving down the freeway, it's sunny and 72 degrees. I'm fine. But there are people dying over there and I look around and it's like it's not even happening. It's barely on the news, no one talks about it. No one cares. And if I stay too long I'll forget about it too. \n[171]We're at war and I'm headed to the mall. \n[172]I don't belong here. I can't help anybody- \n[173]Oh shit-- \n[174]I'm going back. \n[175]My little man... \n[176]Look at our boy. Look what we did. I love you, baby. We made it-- \n[177]This sniper is recording his kills. Mustafa. They sell these in the street. \n[178]I don't want you thinking about it. I don't need you worrying. \n[179]No, it's not. They're savages. \n[180]They're fuckin savages. \n[181]Can you give me a second--? \n[182]You okay? Jeff?-- \n[183]I'm proud of you. You hear me? \n[184]Dad too. He's proud of you. \n[185]What? \n[186]You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps. Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher. We'll be heading in under cover of darkness, sector P13, north of the river-- \n[187]Breacher-up. \n[188]Tell em they won't be leaving till we do-- Ask if they seen him. \n[189]Let's keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going. \n[190]What do we got? \n[191]Sixteen? \n[192]He still inside? \n[193]You got a problem? I didn't promote myself. \n[194]Hash out tactics. We go at zero-dark. And Big Giggles is making the coffee. \n[195]Tell him that's very generous of him. \n[196]Tell him he's gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him-- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there. \n[197]It's his choice. Tell him. \n[198]We have eyes on the target. Flushing them out the back-- \n[199]Help him-- \n[200]They're coming back up! Watch your six-- \n[201]Pull back! Loading-- \n[202]Contact. Eyes on The Butcher. 12 o'clock. \n[203]Dauber? You got visual? Confirm. \n[204]Advancing along the wall. The Butcher jumps into a truck. \n[205]He's on the move. Crossing! \n[206]I offered his father detention. I gave him a choice-- \n[207]It's not over. \n[208]I don't know... \n[209]Hey, some help here-- She's crying-- \n[210]You don't get to choose, bubba. \n[211]You get what it gives you. That's how this thing works. \n[212]Don't do this. Get up. Come on-- \n[213]Get off the floor. Right now-- \n[214]That's me. \n[215]Did I--? \n[216]Yeah. Right. Well, you Marines saved our ass plenty out there. How you holding up? \n[217]Did you lose some friends? \n[218]Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to hear that. \n[219]We have the rest of our lives for that. \n[220]We can wait. They can't. \n[221]Here? \n[222]You want some savage's ring? What if it's a blood diamond? \n[223]Not for a rock. \n[224]Ease off, don't get too close. You gonna tell her where it came from? \n[225]The Butcher has his peepers out. \n[226]I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn't have to save your ass-- \n[227]Is it just me? Or other guys too? \n[228]Get me a shot, grandma. \n[229]What the fuck!? How'd he survive-- \n[230]We're headed to the roof. Secure the van. \n[231]He didn't-- \n[232]So much for him having my horseshoe. \n[233]She'll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent. \n[234]They're all like that. \n[235]No!-- \n[236]Biggles is down. Man down. No, buddy. No! Stay with me-- \n[237]Cover! I need cover. He's picking us off. \n[238]You got nothing to be sorry for. I shouldn't have had us up there-- \n[239]Coulda been any of us. Just hang on-- \n[240]Don't die, Ryan. You hold on-- \n[241]He was 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper makes that shot. \n[242]We're going back. \n[243]For Biggles. \n[244]Some stronghold. Move. \n[245]You sure we got the right address-- \n[246]Marc-- \n[247]An AQI informant called in a tip. Biggles had just been shot. We were operating off emotion and-- we walked into an ambush. \n[248]But that's not what killed him. That letter did. That letter killed Marc. He let go and he paid the price for it. \n[249]If something ever happened to me-- you'd meet someone else. You'd be alright. \n[250]No. \n[251]I do it for you. To protect you. \n[252]Without this, there's nothing. \n[253]I could never live with myself. \n[254]I know. \n[255]Hey, buddy-- \n[256]I'm right here just give me a minute-- Just blind as a bat, huh? \n[257]That's good. Your face always needed a little fixing. \n[258]I heard you proposed? Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales? \n[259]Nice. \n[260]No she's not. How can you say that? She's getting you. All four inches. \n[261]You're probably right. \n[262]Is that what they say? \n[263]The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City. \n[264]We're gonna wall `em in and hunt `em down. \n[265]Yes I do. You're my brother and they're going to pay for what they did to you. \n[266]Any other Punishers here? \n[267]Teams and shit. \n[268]I know. I visited him before I left. That fucker can't see shit. \n[269]Don't do it-- \n[270]--please God-- \n[271]He rolls off the gun, gasping for air, biting back tears. After nearly a decade of war he's finally breaking down. \n[272]How deep? \n[273]Is it Mustafa? \n[274]What was that-- \n[275]3rd floor. In a fruit locker. Breath racing. Hands tremoring. Electricity coursing through him. Gun pointed north, Chris searches nearby buildings for the sniper. PUSH BEHIND HIM, SIX-BLOCKS SOUTH to-- \n[276]\n[277]No-- It came from behind us. We went the wrong way. He's south of the wall. \n[278]I got something. 1900 yards out. \n[279]Correction. 2100 yards out. \n[280]It's him. \n[281]This is Charlie 7 Bravo. We have eyes on the target. Initiate QRF. Over. \n[282]He has eyes on our guys. \n[283]Aim small. Aim small. \n[284]For Biggles. \n[285]There are two ways onto the roof. We cover both stairways and conserve ammo. \n[286]Conserve-- \n[287]Do it. Call in our coordinates. \n[288]--you got four rounds. \n[289]Hey baby-- \n[290]I'm ready to come home. I'm ready... \n[291]--I'm coming home. Can you hear me? \n[292]Go, go, let's move-- \n[293]Stryker-3, what's your location-- \n[294]Hold there! We are 30 seconds out-- Go. Straight ahead. Go-- \n[295]--hello? \n[296]Yeah, I got out early. \n[297]I'm here, I'm stateside. \n[298]I guess I just needed a minute. \n[299]Yeah, I know... Me too. I'm coming. \n[300]Yeah. I'm good. \n[301]Okay. \n[302]That's not me. \n[303]I was just protecting my guys. They were trying to kill our soldiers and-- I'm willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took. The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn't save. \n[304]How's it feel? \n[305]I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and-- \n[306]We gotta take care of our own. \n[307]Get `em up, lil' lady. Hands in the air. \n[308]Tell it to the judge. \n[309]We could lock the doors. They can't get out of the yard. \n[310]You're worth fighting for. \n[311]Yes, ma'am. Right up the middle. \n[312]I meant what I said about locking the doors. \n[313]Not for four minutes. \n[314]It'll take half that. Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you. \n[315]This Marine. His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help. \n[316]I gotta go do something but when I get back, okay? But you have to let me win. \n[317]I should get going... \n[318]Look after our women, Bubba. Love you, babe. ", "TAYA": "\n[1]Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? \n[2]I watched you take your ring off. Don't be a scumbag. Go home. \n[3]Yeah? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone? \n[4]Is that how it is with you guys-- suddenly single after three beers? \n[5]That's great. A real red-neck. \n[6]What's the difference? \n[7]What do you do for work? You look like military. \n[8]Do I look stupid to you? \n[9]Not until you tell me what you do. \n[10]You're obviously military. What branch? \n[11]Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL? \n[12]I know all about you guys. My sister was engaged to a SEAL. \n[13]You're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL. \n[14]Why? \n[15]Where are you going? \n[16]I said I'd never marry one. \n[17]Taya. \n[18]Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all, isn't it Chris? \n[19]Sounds like you're under attack. \n[20]--I'm not going home with you so don't even think about it. \n[21]You figured what? \n[22]Did you always want to be a soldier? \n[23]So you started rescuing girls from bars? \n[24]Only when I'm depressed. \n[25]Someday. My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men. \n[26]I've proven her right. \n[27]What happens when there's a real person on the other end of that gun? \n[28]I know. I don't... \n[29]I want to. I do... \n[30]You hardly even know me. \n[31]Nothing. Everything. I don't know. What if it doesn't work out? \n[32]You got it all planned out, don't you. \n[33]Well... you're gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that. \n[34]Oh my god! No! Chris-- \n[35]What the hell is on your neck? \n[36]What do you-- \n[37]I'm so afraid. \n[38]Your heart is beating out of your chest. \n[39]Have you killed anyone yet? \n[40]Don't be weird with me. Seriously. I want you to tell me everything. \n[41]You knocked me up and now I'm stuck here by myself assembling baby-cribs and you can't talk to me? That's the big plan? \n[42]You guys almost done over there yet? \n[43]It's called a nightgown. \n[44]And three days is not a honeymoon. \n[45]You want me to talk dirty to you? \n[46]Well, you'll just have to decide what's more important. \n[47]Fat and horny. It's kinda disgusting. \n[48]-So romantic. \n[49]Nobody said it's a boy-- \n[50]How do you know? \n[51]I hope you're right. \n[52]Did your dad get hold of you? \n[53]Shit. You need to call him. Hang up and-- \n[54]I'm so selfish. I wasn't even thinking-- \n[55]Your little brother deployed. \n[56]He didn't get in. Just call your dad-- \n[57]Over there. He's headed to Iraq. \n[58]You were right, doctor says it's a boy. \n[59]Chris!-- \n[60]Chris-- \n[61]I thought you were dead. I thought-- \n[62]I have an alien growing inside me-- \n[63]And there's a strange man in my bedroom. \n[64]Why isn't it on your finger? \n[65]Your hands feel different. \n[66]Why am I so fucking nervous? \n[67]No you're not. Don't lie. \n[68]Why are you so good with me. \n[69]--it might be nice to get out-- \n[70]--are you listening to me? Chris-- \n[71]What do you want to do today, hon'? \n[72]Okay, we do that. Let's relax. \n[73]I'm done being pregnant. I want to meet him. \n[74]Well, this is the first time we left the house. \n[75]Jesus Christ Chris... \n[76]What am I supposed to do. You're not talking. You act like it's all okay-- \n[77]You're not fine. Your blood pressure-- \n[78]Chris-- \n[79]--it's happening-- \n[80]What're you doing! \n[81]--oh my god, you're crazy! You're fucking crazy you know that? \n[82]The baby is crying. I thought you were-- \n[83]Don't bother turning it off, I already watched it. \n[84]I had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos. \n[85]That day we were on the phone-- \n[86]You're not protecting me by not talking about it. \n[87]My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me-- \n[88]Chris-- \n[89]It's not about them, it's about us. You have to make it back to us. \n[90]The news is saying the war is over. \n[91]But are we winning? \n[92]I'm making memories by myself. I have no one to share them with. \n[93]When does that start? Even when you're here you're not here. \n[94]I hate the teams for it. I do. You're my husband and the father of my children-- but they're the ones that pull you back. \n[95]If you think this war isn't changing you you're wrong. \n[96]You can only circle the flame so long. \n[97]Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you? \n[98]Chris? I want to know what you thought of his letter... \n[99]Do you want to die? Is that what it is? \n[100]Then tell me why do you do it. I want to understand. \n[101]No you don't. I'm here. Your family is here. Your children have no father-- \n[102]Bullshit. It's not about us anymore. You don't know when to quit.
