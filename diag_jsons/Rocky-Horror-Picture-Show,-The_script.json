He's a little brought down - Because when you knocked He thought you were the candyman. \n[2]Don't get strung out by the way that I look. \n[3]Don't judge a book by its cover I'm not much of a man By the light of day But by night I'm one hell of a lover. \n[4]I'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound You look like you're both pretty groovie. Or if you want something visual not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie. \n[5]You got caught with a flat Well how about that Well babies don't you panic By the light of the night It'll seem alright I'll get you a satanic mechanic. \n[6]I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. \n[7]Why dont'cha stay for the night \"night\" Or maybe a bite \"bite\" I could show you my favourite obsession I've been making a man With blonde hair and a tan And he's good for relieving my tension. \n[8]I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania. I'm just a sweet transvestite. \n[9]From Transexual Transylvania. \n[10]So come up to the Lab. \n[11]And see what's on the slab. \n[12]I see you shiver with anticipation \n[13]But maybe the rain \n[14]Is really to blame \n[15]So I'll remove the cause But not the symptom \n[16]Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff. \n[17]I will entertain...ah... \n[18]And what charming underclothes you both have. (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on.  They'll make you feel less vulnerable. \n[19]It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality. \n[20]How forceful you are Brad.  Such a perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant. You must be awfully proud of him Janet. \n[21]Do you have any tattoos Brad. \n[22]RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder. \n[23]Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear me at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists. \n[24]Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research. \n[25]And paradise is to be mine. \n[26]It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really. One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break.  (He cracks the bones in his hand)  All the pieces seem to fit into place.  What a sucker you'r been. What a fool.  The answer was there all the time.  It took a small accident to make it happen.  An accident! An accident. \n[27]That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life. \n[28]You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate. For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born. \n[29]Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator. \n[30]And step up the reactor power input three more points. \n[31]Well.  That's no way to behave on your first day out. But as you're such an exceptional beauty I'm prepared to forgive. I just love success. \n[32]Yes. \n[33]Yes. \n[34]O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a little better than that. You.    What do you think? \n[35]I didn't make him for you He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't even take the lessons. \n[36]A weakling weighing Ninety eight pounds Will get sand in his face When kicked to the ground. And soon in the gym With a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his ca-ha-hause \n[37]Will make him glisten - thank you - And gleam. And with massage And just a little bit of Ste-he-he-he-hem... He'll be pink. And quite clean. \n[38]He'll be a strong man - Oh honey - But the wrong man. \n[39]He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs. Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days, I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an \n[40]He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk. He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand. When, in just seven days - Oh baby... I can make you A ma-a-a-a-an.... \n[41]One from the vaults. And so perish all those who reject my love! Oh no, my little Adonis - You're much too beautiful to be destroyed. He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle. \n[42]But a deltoid And a bicep, A hot groin And a tricep Makes me - ooh - Shake. Makes me want To take Charles Atlas By the ha-and. In just seven days - Oh baby - I can make you a Ma-ha-ha-ha-haan. I don't want no dissension Just dynamic tension. In just seven days I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haan. In just seven days I can make you A ma-ha-ha-ha-haaan. \n[43]I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice? \n[44]Nothing.  Why, do you think I should? \n[45]I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual. \n[46]Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this? \n[47]Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet. \n[48]Cross my heart and hope to die. \n[49]I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice? \n[50]Nothing.  Why do you think I should? \n[51]I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable. Oh so soft.  So sensual. \n[52]Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this? \n[53]Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure. \n[54]Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her. \n[55]On my mother's grave. \n[56]I'm coming. \n[57]Creature of the night. \n[58]How did it happen?  I understood you were to be watching. \n[59]Well, see if you can find him on the monitor. \n[60]I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose. \n[61]I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me. \n[62]And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad? \n[63]Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room. \n[64]Well, let's ask him. \n[65]Don't play games, Dr Scott.  You know very well what Brad Majors's doing here. It was part of your plan was it not that he, and his female, should check the layout for you.  Well, unfortunately for you all there's to be a change of plans.  I'm sure you're adaptable, Dr Scott.  I know Brad is. \n[66]Eddie?  What do you know of Eddie, Dr Scott? \n[67]Rocky! \n[68]Listen!  I made you, and I can break you just as easily. \n[69]That's better. \n[70]Doctor Scott you can sample the speciality of the house - roast loin of pork. \n[71]Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional. \n[72]A toast to absent friends. \n[73]It's a rather tender subject.... Another slice anyone. \n[74]Go on, Dr. Scott - or should I say doctor von Scott. \n[75]What a guy \n[76]What guy \n[77]What a guy \n[78]Oh Rocky, how could you! \n[79]I'll tell you once, Won't tell you twice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss. Y'apple pie Don't taste too nice You'd better wise up Janet Weiss. \n[80]I've laid the seed It should be all you need. You're as sensual As a pencil Wound up like an 'E' or first string \n[81]When we made it Did ya hear a bell ring? \n[82]Y'got a block, Take my advice. You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. \n[83]Will seduce yah. \n[84]You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools. \n[85]It's something you'll Get used to. A mental mind fuck Can be nice. \n[86]Planet. Schmanet. Janet. \n[87]You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. You'd better wise up, Build your thighs up. You'd better wise up. \n[88]Don't get hot and flustered - Use a bit of mustard. \n[89]It's not easy having a good time. Even smiling makes my face ache. \n[90]My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake in splitting his brain between the two of them. \n[91]Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother RIff Raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me I can be quite generous. \n[92]And you shall receive it - in abundance.

Do any of you guys know the Madison? \n[46]For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet. \n[47]It's just a..a party Janet. \n[48]We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone. \n[49]Let's wait awhile Janet.

And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K. \n[77]And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again.

", "NARRATOR": "\n[1]I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey. \n[2]It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them.  It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving.  It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air.  But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. On a night out. \n[3]It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time. \n[4]And so it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and that they had found the assistance that their plight required - or had they? \n[5]It's just a jump to the left. \n[6]With your hands on your hips. \n[7]It's just a jump to the left. \n[8]With your hands on your hips. \n[9]Rocky needed peace of mind. He didn't know He was doing just fine. He was the product Of another time. And as for feeling down - Well that's not a crime. \n[10]There are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations!  If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe. However, the sudden departure of their host and his creation (into the seclusion of his sombre bridal suite) had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. A feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms. \n[11]\"If\" and \"Only\", two small words.  Words which kept repeating themselves again and again in Janet's thoughts.  But it was too late to go back now.  It was as if she were riding a giant tidal wave.  It would be folly to fight against it.  Her only chance would be to ride it out - adapt - and perhaps also to survive. \n[12]\"Emotion\".  Mental agitation - an excited state of. It is also an irrational and powerful master and from what Janet had witnessed on the monitor, there seemed to be little doubt that she was indeed its slave. \n[13]Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals.  The breaking of bread - the last meal of the condemned man - and now this meal.  However informal it might appear you can be sure there was to be very little 'bonhomie'. \n[14]But he never caused her Nothing but shame. \n[15]Then she cries out - \n[16]And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen.  And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit.  This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion.  What further indignities were they to be subjected to?  And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic. \n[17]And crawling on the planet's face Some insects called the human race Lost in time, and lost in space And meaning.
