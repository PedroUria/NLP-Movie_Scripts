If I'm drunk and pass out-before you cum, I'll-send you a gift certificate to Berl, Bath, and Beyond. People seem to be digging it, Adam is enjoying it. He seems more comfortable in'his skin. \n[339]Great, I'll do anything that makes any kind of money. Just maybe not something where I.have to ride a. horse-and then underneath it says: Herpes. \n[340]You know my Dad? \n[341]\n[342]Dad. \n[343]Thank you. Dad. For 'a. lot; of . things.

A Lot. \n[355]No, you're just high. \n[356]Of course I'm coming home with you, are you, kidding me? ' They kiss.

That sounds good. Emma looks happy, closes her eyes. Adam keeps his eyes open, scared out of his mind. \n[361]Hello Los :Angeles. Emma, with a hoodie over her scrubs, comes in the back. \n[362]And it suddenly became clear why none of my girlfriends ever wanted to have sex with me. I thought it was just because my dick was too big and it scared them-But apparently-that's not the problem. At all. Actually, I've heard it's like acupuncture- you're- on your back the whole time and you don't even feel it go in. That's what my ex-girlfriend told me before she started dating my father. Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her hand. \n[363]Actually they're getting married. So Mother's Day just keeps getting better and better.

But the one about peeing, in front of you. I.'m gonna do that whenever I can. Emma laughs and cries. \n[398]Are you glad I'm making this face? Adam makes a funny face. Emma laughs. \n[399]I'm totally, completely, - ridiculously in love with you- Adam kisses-down.-her stomach, she laughs, happy, it feels good... then she turns and sees the'TV screen where'Thumper thumping his leg. \n[400]Hey.' \n[401]What are we going to have for breakfast? Emma, still half-asleep, smiles. \n[402]I'm going to get you so 'much bacon... Thankfully,'we don't have to see that.

Adam starts crying, trying to hide it. \n[14]Why are-you crying? \n[15]Jesus.. Exwaa pats him a'couple times on the shoulder. \n[16]Look. I'm not really an affectionate person. Emu a, very uncomfortable, puts her-arm around him. He lets her. They.don't look at. each other. \n[17]Hello Adam Kurtzman,. of Camp Weehawken: I'm Emma.

The fleeting passions of a drunken night.-The wayI .see it we're all just these big dumb.. animals. who, for the most .part; just want  to have sex with each other.: So maybe we should stop beating ourselves up for what-we feel and just make sweet bone. \n[39]And also, it's somewhat improbable, but I like you.
