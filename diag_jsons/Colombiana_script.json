But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me. \n[144]This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things.

He killed them. \n[148]I didn't know how else to find him. \n[149]It took you a long time. \n[150]What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them. \n[151]And now I want to finish it. \n[152]Yes you can. He's protected by your government. \n[153]You're going to have to try harder. 101. \n[154]I found this on your table inside. Your family, right? \n[155]Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice. \n[156]I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years. \n[157]When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work. \n[158]You guys ever been to New Orleans? \n[159]Good morning. 105. \n[160]I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each. \n[161]You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia. \n[162]I would love to see the plans of this house. \n[163]Yes, it is. \n[164]It's Cataleya. \n[165]For something you can never understand.

You take a kid, teach them, they have value. \n[8]Are you stupid or what? Here. \n[9]Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job. 10. \n[10]Remember me Cataleya? \n[11]I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. I see he gave you his medal. \n[12]The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him. I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen. \n[13]Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is? \n[14]Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you? \n[15]This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that? 11. \n[16]But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like... \n[17]This. \n[18]I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right? \n[19]Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than... \n[20]This. Maybe it was in this. \n[21]Do you know what I am talking about? \n[22]Excellent. Do you know where it is? \n[23]Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want. 12. \n[24]But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes? \n[25]So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. Will you do that? \n[26]You are a smart girl. \n[27]And in this life, smart girls get everything they want. What do you want Cat? \n[28]Just tell me sweetheart...what do you want? \n[29]\n[30]Get her! \n[31]We need her alive! \n[32]Go! Go! \n[33]There! \n[34]Alive! 16. \n[35]North! Go North!

Come on. 77. \n[51]Here. For you. \n[52]First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer? \n[53]You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio? \n[54]I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it. \n[55]So you do have a memory. \n[56]\n[57]Fuck... \n[58]You don't tell me what I want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. One...two... \n[59]You will take up positions here... \n[60]And here. And here. You must expect the unexpected. She is like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on. You will not see her, until it is too late. She is that invisible. 106. \n[61]We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it. \n[62]You four! Get the armored Mercedes! We have to get Don Luis out of here! \n[63]Don Luis! This way! Everyone to their positions! \n[64]Don Luis! You hide here. \n[65]Wait for my call. Either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. Take the van.

I killed him! You want to avenge them? The whore and the coward? That's what you come from! Come out! I'm here! Come get the bullet with your name on it, Bitch! \n[77]Kill her! 111. \n[78]You two here!

The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us. \n[11]And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we? \n[12]If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it.

Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing... 58. \n[18]We have one. As we go to the video tape. \n[19]We can't see the assassin, but we can see... \n[20]The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you. \n[21]These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him.

I've met this woman. The killer. \n[59]My apartment. She trapped me. She told me if I did not get her this man. \n[60]She will kill a member of my family every day until I have none. \n[61]Do I look like I could make something like that up? \n[62]So? What should I do now? \n[63]Ross. It's her. 103. \n[64]She says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office. \n[65]Bright red. \n[66]She says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. And you have ten seconds to give her the address. \n[67]You can't. But I can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. Trust me on this one. \n[68]She asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential. \n[69]Thank you. Because honestly I didn't know how I was going to explain you splattered all over your walls. \n[70]Was there anything else? \n[71]We don't really have anything to charge you with. \n[72]Just a few more questions. \n[73]Sure. \n[74]Cataleya?

A growing body needs sleep. When I was your age I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was well rested for whatever came after. \n[11]My son. Your cousin. \n[12]He's dead. \n[13]Yes. \n[14]No one who is still alive. \n[15]You are very talented. Is this what you want to be?

The bad news is Don Luis was playing both sides, and has disappeared. You tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip. It is something he will not forget.

No exceptions. \n[20]I am trying to educate you. \n[21]She's still in a bit of shock. \n[22]We'll get all this stuff, then go over to this little place I know down on Maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the Polish people make here. \n[23]You like hot dogs? \n[24]Hey! \n[25]Hey! \n[26]Where you going? \n[27]Chica. Any idiot can be a killer. Look! \n[28]You want me to teach you to be a killer? No problema. I'll teach you.

At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them.

Another jeep appears over the hill behind her. Starts to come at her. \n[16]As she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a plan.

Cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera.
