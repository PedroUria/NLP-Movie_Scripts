{"dialogues": {"MARY": "\n[1]The principal did'nothing. Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What's the matter with education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and... mollusks and... not get stabbed on the way home.  4. \n[2]Right.  Coffee's by the door. S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face. \n[3]not listening .Lalalala... \n[4]Will you slow down. \n[5]I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining weight. Honey, take a look at my waist. \n[6]Is my dress too tight? \n[7]Really, my waist isn't too big? \n[8]All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't leave the building till then. I'll be there. \n[9]Give me a kiss, you snot.     16. \n[10]Two-thirty. \n[11]You want anything from the store? He's gone. \n[12]You're sweet, Nick. He cracks a wet smile. Mary, aware, unhands the artichoke. Moves on. \n[13]I have no money. \n[14]I'm here to withdraw money. This stumps the brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he's stuffing her bag... \n[15]Tell me... what happened? \n[16]I was held up... \n[17].at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry. \n[18]He's looking for answers. He's Upset. \n[19].He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it. \n[20]You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set. \n[21]What? Horus turns his focus to the TV - more Hancock FOOTAGE. He watches Mary. \n[22]Yes. \n[23]What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay. \n[24]Coffee's by the... door.  Horus? \n[25]You're still up. \n[26]There's something about him... I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage... \n[27]Just a quick one.     39. \n[28]I want to. \n[29]\"Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home.\" \n[30]Shut up. \n[31]\"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby...\"     40. Mary as her voice carries... \n[32]\"Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles awake you when you rise.\" Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him. \n[33]No... no... no! \n[34]Are you OK? \n[35]I came in to... hope you like chicken. Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping for dinner. She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there on her sofa. A calm, while they stare. And then... \n[36]Glasses. \n[37]You know Hancock? \n[38]Which piece would you like? \n[39]Horus is in the securities business. \n[40]It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors. \n[41]Horus, what do I do? \n[42]What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants.     50. It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the surface tension.of water. LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism from which it is generated. The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished faces - mouths agape. \n[43]Aaron.     51. \n[44]He comes home crying. \n[45]Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.     52. \n[46]No, I'll make it right now. \n[47]Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime. Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away. \n[48]What're you doing? She's taken by this scene. \n[49]About him? \n[50]No. They're lying through their collective teeth. \n[51]Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better... \n[52]Go to bed, anyway. She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the door... \n[53]Have a good one. \n[54]What were you doing in the street?  You ripped it pretty good.     64. Hancock - he's lost. \n[55]What're you:.. how old's this thing? \n[56]It'll be all right. \n[57]It's just the seams. I can sew it back. \n[58]This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it. \n[59]Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one. \n[60]\n[61]Let's see. \n[62]Come on, I want to see. \n[63]I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away. \n[64]The water is dirty. \n[65]\n[66]It's not your fault.     66. Hancock looks away. \n[67]You're tense. \n[68]You should slow down. Rest. \n[69]It must be hard. \n[70]To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest. \n[71]Where... who are you? \n[72]You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do. \n[73]It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere...  I mean, maybe it's something about you but... it must be hard on you sometimes. Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer. \n[74]But probably not... probably.. \n[75]So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street? \n[76]You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious. \n[77]Nick's market. Are you sick? \n[78]You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that? \n[79]Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious. \n[80]Yes. \n[81]What facts? He's not a hero. \n[82]Aaron likes him. \n[83]No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed. \n[84]All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean? Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover. \n[85]All right, already. How's your mouth? \n[86]Hold still. \n[87]Shut up.     74. Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't realize he's there. Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him. \n[88]Horus? \n[89]Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other. \n[90]Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him. \n[91]Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.     15. \n[92]\n[93]Your hair. Come on, have a seat. \n[94]Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework. \n[95]There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.     76. \n[96]How do you like it? \n[97]I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money. \n[98]His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood.  It tpok everything out of him. He didn't talk for days after he was cut. He took it real hard. I mean, still, he's not... I mean,, he's still...  .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I understand that I'm not intolerant of it, the working-through process. It's just that, sometimes...  sometimes, I need his strength. I miss. the strength. \n[99]Want? \n[100]The hair... I need to...     77. She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down. \n[101]Yes? \n[102]Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close. \n[103]Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah! \n[104]All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him... \n[105]You're leaving? \n[106]I'm sorry. \n[107]Really? On the boardwalk? \n[108]I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought. \n[109]Good night. \n[110]What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox. \n[111]Eat... and we'll go.  Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair. \n[112]I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry. \n[113]Yeah... why? \n[114]What? \n[115]Is everything all right?     89. Hancock has no response. \n[116]What's wrong? \n[117]Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness. \n[118]Nothing. I don't know... I don't see anything. \n[119]Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there? \n[120]Hancock... what... \n[121]Me? What can I do?  What do you want me to do? \n[122]How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away. \n[123]Don ' t.     91. \n[124]I can't. \n[125]I'm married. A pause. \n[126]I love him. The death blow. \n[127]I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do? \n[128]I'm sorry.     92. She leaves. \n[129]Horus... \n[130]What happened toyou? \n[131]Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room. \n[132]Go! Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace. \n[133]What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her. \n[134]Horus, what're you talking about?  Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.     100. \n[135]Why do you say that? \n[136]\n[137]Horns, what are you doing? Inserts the flashlight into his holster. \n[138]Horus! \n[139]\"Once there was a way, to get back homeward...\" \n[140]once there was a way, to get back home...\" Her voice grips him. Torments him... \n[141]\"Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will sing a lullaby...\"  Good night, darling. Kisses him. \n[142]Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by the door. \n[143]Really? \n[144]What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her. \n[145]Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron. \n[146]Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.     101. \n[147]What're you doing? \n[148]Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks. \n[149]No... \n[150]\n[151]I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond. \n[152]You're fighting a lot, right now. I know that.  They're out there waiting for you. It's like... sometimes.., you feel like the world's waiting for you. Expecting. What's your next move, they want to know... \n[153]and the responsibility. The duty. You can't shrug it off.  I know that. And I'm sorry. Hancock - a committed stare into space. Can he hear her? \n[154]Maybe... if you knew that, that I know. And. That I won't expect anything from you. And... there doesn't have to be a next move. Hancock turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch. Mary - back to wall, on the defensive. He approaches. Stands before her. He reaches back... and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently shielding her. from the cold. There is no eye contact. \n[155]What have you dome? \n[156]Horus! \n[157]Horus! \n[158]Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him.  It'll never go away. Hancock responds to \"it.\" \n[159]If you've got anything left... inside...  and you do, I know you do... whatever it was that you felt for me... inside... then you won't go out there. He just looks at her. \n[160]Just let go... and it'll go away. Please, just let go. ", "HANCOCK": "\n[1]Written by \n[2]on the dotted line. Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's grab. \n[3]I need quiet. Is it quiet? \n[4]it's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you... to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to sleep.     13. \n[5]it's about responsibility... Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner... On the tube, the commercial segues way into... \n[6]Everybody out, please. Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.     26. Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped figure, until real estate ushers her into the street. \n[7]Why'd you go and do that for? Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He bleeds. \n[8]Why don't we call it the day. \n[9]If you're going to tease, cock the damn gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded animal act of desperation. I don't got c, time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't expect... dialogue and \"come with me and you won't be hurt\" bullshit. You walk out of here with me and your life is a violent storm. You will be hurt, you will be abused... whatever turns them on. Either way, your days are shit! Those are the realities, spelled out. \n[10]You got half the precinct out there, armed, trained to blow the tail off a sperm from a hundred yards... you're standing in here, cornered, three bullets left in that squirter of yours, if you're lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need the aggravation. I don't need this. \n[11]I'm all out. Let's go... And as he utters this, he approaches Tom. \n[12]\n[13]'Nothing. I'm sorry. And with that, he floats out into the night. \n[14]What are you thinking? The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground - one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt. The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the pavement. \n[15]What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS. \n[16]Huh?! Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the- Hoodlum's nose. \n[17]Want to see brain? Huh?! Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside. Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth. The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.     36. \n[18]What he's got to do... a man's got to do it. \n[19]Gina. \n[20]You smoke? \n[21]Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.  Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner. \n[22]Ever curious... .what it's like? Aaron shakes his head. \n[23]Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't kill you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on it. Doubles over, coughing. \n[24]Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your first stick. Then, after a few more... it starts getting this. flavor. A little nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical. \n[25]From manure to pure cane sugar. That's change. Today... you're a boy. Tomorrow, Mr. Penis comes knocking. Shakes your hand. Takes you for a walk... and tells you about life's simple pleasures. You're a man. And you don't look back..  You see... things evolve. Nothing is wholly inert. A step in any direction... you're walking into pockets of evolution. That is living... taking those steps. And change. Can start by changing some principles. Blank best describes Aaron's face.     43. \n[26]Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do.  I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse... an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. , Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide. \n[27]You do what is necessary. \n[28]What is necessary.  Let me tell you something, kid. There was this infantry unit, you see... badly outnumbered.  Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A fox and he's walking through what, the woods, the forests, right? Next thing the fox knows, he's staring down a pack of... hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this chase, the fox's running his ass off, over boulders and through streams and, but the damn hounds are still on his tail. Finally the fox comes to this cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a seven hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds are closing in and they're going to tear him to pieces. So what does he think... \"I jump and I die for sure. I stay, confront them and I'll get my ass butchered.\" Decision time. He thinks, \"stay and least I'd have something, a chance.      44. \n[29]To slip away, maybe.\" The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand. Right?  The hounds come. What do you think happens? \n[30]No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric. \n[31]But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying... just before he keels off? Aaron - negative. \n[32]Now he's gurgling, choking on his own blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying next to his entrails, you know... and you know what he says?  \"No regrets.\" \n[33]No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And \"no regrets.\" Aaron - submitting it to memory. \n[34]Look at it this way... I got to do what I got to do. \n[35]I'm sorry. \n[36]Man of the house? \n[37]Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush. \n[38]No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART. \n[39]not about the labor... or the love of it.  .It's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man... because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer, observes. \n[40]so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about... essence. The essence of the man... not his clothes. It's the job. Take away the arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions but not his trade, his profession. That case, you strip him of what he is... a man. Horus a firm grasp of the concept. \n[41]What line of work are you in, Mr. Longfellow? \n[42]You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it.  We're in the same business. Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle. A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares at the BOTTLE. \n[43]Aaron, could you show me the restroom? Aaron points first door in the hall. \n[44]and you could see the flames, through the storm... I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy... crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men... and he's got to live with it.  Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard in a parking lot a couple months after. A good man...  . did what he had to do. A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination. \n[45]No... there's no shame in it. The crying. It's relief...  we're older and we don't remember when... we go, \"God, when was the last time?\" Maybe it's me. It's more an effort, now. Takes more pain... more blood. Like it's, do you have the time anymore? Even to look back and recall a moving experience. To be moved.  By rage. Hurt.  By love.  But if you have to remember the last time something touched you... you've missed it - you've forgotten how to cry. Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose nature he has yet to comprehend. Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door. Hancock - holds him accountable. \n[46]Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too. \n[47]No, I need to go.  The last time I had a meal... an evening like this, I was... it was too long ago. I appreciate your kindness. \n[48]Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll drop by after school. See how you're doing. \n[49]Need a lift? \n[50]How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles. \n[51]didn't see it coming... left myself open. \n[52]All right? \n[53]What? \n[54]You'll sew -it? \n[55]You have to be quick. \n[56]If you blink, you'll miss it. Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into moisture. It showers into his open hands. Mary reaches for it. Too late. \n[57]\n[58]I'm sorry. \n[59]I've been tired, lately. \n[60]-So people tell me. \n[61]Hard? \n[62]It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare... the totality of fear itself... that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms... to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of \"wow.\" \n[63]It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what... where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man.     67. \n[64]Why... do you say that? \n[65]Yes...  sometimes. Mary allows the moment to sink in. \n[66]I was lost...  . but I think I'm ok, now. \n[67]What? \n[68]Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic, putting away things... \n[69]He was in the-police academy? A pause. \n[70]Is that what you want? \n[71]What you need? \n[72]Mary? \n[73]You ever been down the boardwalk, at night? \n[74]It's getting late.     78. \n[75]I'm going to take a walk. \n[76]Maybe. Pause. \n[77]Good night, Mary. \n[78]Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door. \n[79]What? \n[80]got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a decision brewing... \n[81]I know you're up, Mary. I know you can hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's important that I talk to y ou, then.  Please, Mary. And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned. \n[82]Hi.  Thank you for being here. \n[83]\n[84]They're moving. The turbulence has started. \n[85]Look out there and what do you see, Mary? \n[86]see it,can Y nu?  And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out there. \n[87]Duty.  You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you. He'll say: \"you do what you have to do.\" Or what? You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't... if you can't.  And... but. If I can't, then who?      90. \n[88]The next guy? No. There is no \"I can't.\" Just \"I must.\" Mary - watching a grown superman unravel. \n[89]But I don't ask, \"why me?\" I don't question it. This is me. I'm it. I do what I have to do. I get in there.., all the killing... the blood... and I deal with it. I clean up. I make things right.  And. But when.., where does it end?  Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's everywhere. And it stays. All that I can do, Mary. The things I am capable of doing, I can't blink away the hell I've seen. It's in me...  in here and I can't not think about it. It's in me. It's me. \n[90]I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll break. I need to get away. Get away to where? I don't know.  I need your help. \n[91]I want you to save me. \n[92]Save me. \n[93]You can.  \n[94]To whom? \n[95]No.  Unacceptable. \n[96]I'm cold. Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat. \n[97]Fuck off. He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly. \n[98]What're you doing here? \n[99]I don't know what you're talking about. \n[100]You don't want to go where I'm going. \n[101]Listen. Aaron recoils. \n[102]Listen. I'm not here to save you.  1     96. \n[103]No, not my job. Don't put that on me.  Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are and... what I say, it won't do you any change. You'll grow up to be just like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it... 'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle. Aaron backs away from his angry wrath. \n[104]That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not here to save you. He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed against the rocks. In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint. \n[105]I can't.     98. \n[106]I can't. \n[107]I can't. His arm rips through the glass... \n[108]I can't! \n[109]I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom. \n[110]No... don't. No.  No! He moves away. Angry. Tired. Drunk. Hancock drops against the wall, beaten... \n[111]Mary. Mary launches back, cold. Outside the window and in frontrof her - Hancock, suspended in air. The blood-red of his eyes p nothing but bad news. And being so, he EXPLODES through the glass. Glass rains through trance. n the kitchen, amplifying his e     106. \n[112]Amway, anyone? The pursuit commences - Hancock steadies after Mary, in retreat around the living room. \n[113]It's the haircut, Mary.  I'm pissed! Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him. \n[114]Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his back. \n[115]You're getting on my nerves. \n[116]What I got to do. \n[117]Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES Hancock across the face. \n[118]Help me. \n[119]Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him struggle. \n[120]No... do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through... \n[121]Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of superFLESH. He stares at them all, invincible. \n[122]Go away! \n[123]I made them go away. \n[124]The noise... \n[125]Why?! \n[126]I can't.  122. \n[127]You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the man. Horus disappears inside. \n[128]Come out, you little shit. A pause in action - no reply from Horus. \n[129]Are you a man?! Horus answers... He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the brick structure. \n[130]No mercy. He takes aim... ", "HORUS": "\n[1]How's the eye? \n[2]It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there. \n[3]There'll always be people around who'll... exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts. \n[4]The thing to do is... to avoid them. They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the anger... and move on. You hold the anger.  I tell you because I can't take it, seeing you hurt. You're part of me.  I've felt what you're feeling now. And if you've got any of me in you, you're gonna feel what I felt-when you go up against one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you do... the other cheek. You do that for me. No, you're not the coward. Not you. No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause I don't want to see you hurt. I love you. I ask you to do that for me... your old man. And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark hallway - moved b y his affection. She oversees a father-son embrace. \n[5]I'm late for work. Get some sleep. Tomorrow always feels better... \n[6]Mary.     9. up against her husband. He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator. \n[7]I'm late. Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost expected it. \n[8]Roheim.     12. He's done this before. \n[9]Roheim. Let's go home. Roheim stirs... \n[10]I just made the last run. He helps the old man to his feet. \n[11]Clyde... Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face. \n[12]Thanks. \n[13]How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel. \n[14]Mary? Mary blinks back her attention. \n[15]Why is he mad at me? \n[16]Let me see your eye...  I told him about the other cheek. Avoid confrontations... to turn the other cheek. \n[17]Aaron. \n[18]Mary?     33. \n[19]Good thing he was there. I don't know what I'd do... if you... Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She turns to face an empty room. \n[20]Oh, it's not like you... what you do or anything. A department store over on Third. \n[21]I'm a security guard. I'm just...     49. Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge. \n[22]It's a night job. I sit around. \n[23]I need to get ready. \n[24]Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't want to interfere. I have work. \n[25]It's all right, Mary. I'm late. \n[26]I don't have time. I'll grab some on the way. Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free. \n[27]I don't want to interrupt. Please don't let me stop you. \n[28]I'm this way. Hancock points the opposite way. \n[29]It's a short walk. Acknowledged. An awkward beat while they stare at each other... . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight. From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face. \n[30]A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it. \n[31]How are you, John?  Frank? \n[32]You know... things are slow. \n[33]Another dream?' \n[34]Roheim. \n[35]Come on. \n[36]No. \n[37]No. \n[38]You shouldn't drink. \n[39]Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief moment? \n[40]Sure. \n[41]Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic attire. She nods affirmatively. \n[42]I can't sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms her own with the left, as reference. Horus tilts his head away from her hand.     71. \n[43]Please, Mary. \n[44]No thank you.  Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up \n[45]He'll take him home? \n[46]What do we know about this man? The papers... they don't have all the facts about him. \n[47]Yes. A hero. I know that... \n[48]I know that maybe, I've been neglectful... that I haven't been there... Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair. \n[49]I'm trying... you have to know... I'd like to be more... involved. Like it used to be. Before we moved here.      72. \n[50]\n[51]Aaron, tomorrow... \n[52]I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I pick you. \n[53]Dear God. Horus catches him. \n[54]Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds. \n[55]Who... what happened? \n[56]Why didn't you come through the back... standing out there in the dark? \n[57]What're you doing?     81. \n[58]Sit down Could you knock it off, please. so I can clean the cuts. He leads the old wretch back to the chair. \n[59]Stop. \n[60]You're not old. \n[61]No one's canning anyone. No one saw us... watch your step... leave. \n[62]You're going to be okay? \n[63]Get some sleep. \n[64]I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve. \n[65]I'd like my sports page, please. \n[66]I want you to stop taking my sports page. \n[67]I want today's sports page. \n[68]That there... my sports page.     86. \n[69]No. \n[70]No. I would like my sports page now. Please. \n[71]I'd prefer it now. \n[72]Mary! A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the apartment. \n[73]Drink. The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance. \n[74]Is this a bar... or what? Drink. (uncomfortable with his own \n[75]One.more. Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it... \n[76]No... nevermind.  Where's your bathroom? \n[77]How much. \n[78]Thank you. \n[79]Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his knees. \n[80]Aaron. Go to your room. \n[81]Don't \"Horus Longfellow\" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband. \n[82]But you didn't know-about me... Mary knows where this is headed. \n[83]You didn't know I was going to do this to you.  I guess I should've known. We were married and I knew... at the reception. I couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and I watched you dance. In your white dress. And I remember zoning out... for a second, just watching you. God, Mary... the little girl next door who used to get into fist fights with her brothers in those patched-up Toughskins. We met only 'cause the tallest tree in the neighborhood was in my backyard and you needed to climb it.  But that night. God, you looked so beautiful I.had to realize it... how much I loved you... one more time.  You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I remember I'm watching you there, with him... together like that. You looked good with him, I thought all of a sudden. Like you belong... better. And as I stared across the floor, it was the same story with all the guys there, that they were more right for you.  More right because that night, you walked in with the wrong man. \n[84]Because I let you down.  I'm a coward. I can't do anything about it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd have to defend you and Aaron. What do I do, then? What am I if I can't do that... my own wife, family? Not a man.     101. \n[85]All that I can do. And with that, stumbles out of \n[86]Police? \n[87]I saw four. Presumably armed. Only other way out is through the back. The cops trade laughs. \n[88]Mary. He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun NOZZLE, pressed against his temple. \n[89]What're you doing here. ROHEIM ed Mary called earlier. She was worri about you. \n[90]Mary... \n[91]Mary... \n[92]He's got Mary, Roheim.  I got to get her. 11     119. \n[93]I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - \"did he just say that?\" \n[94]Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be here. \n[95]Mary! Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar. \n[96]Mary! \n[97]Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus. Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock. CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the street. Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar. With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying. THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.  123. He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't. Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace towards his wounded game. Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back against the curb, nowhere left to go. Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus - not unlike Scarpo much The situation presents itself - he reacts. A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs. bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus else can he do? Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strike\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd es this piece of jagged metal.   No regrets. \n[98]\n[99]", "AARON": "\n[1]Black. Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before his son. \n[2]Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.     \n[3].after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the room. \n[4]I don't need you walking me to school. \n[5]I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala.., \n[6]I know it. I know it. \n[7]What? \n[8]What? Nothing. It's fine. \n[9]What? Not here, mom. \n[10]I know it, mom. Can I go now? \n[11]Geez! He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks. \n[12]All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children. \n[13]You were late. \n[14]The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit. \n[15]Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs. \n[16]Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this man.     37. \n[17]That's him? \n[18]Don't. \n[19]Mom. \n[20]Oh, mom. \n[21]What?     42. \n[22]Principles? \n[23]What am I suppose to do? \n[24]I wanted... there were three of them. \n[25]He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke. \n[26]What're you saying? \n[27]What? \n[28]Why're you telling me all this?     45. \n[29]Table's done. Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen. \n[30]Geez. Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.     47. Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus does a \"what?\" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind him. He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled. \n[31]He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus. \n[32]You want milk? \n[33]It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.     48. Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,. looking impotent. \n[34]Good arm. \n[35]On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family. \n[36]What do you think, mom? \n[37]mom? \n[38]I wanted to kill him. \n[39]I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move. \n[40]Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off. \n[41]Yeah. Horus watches this - his son slipping away. The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first. Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging wild. We just .don't know.     53. \n[42]Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits. \n[43]No. Not really. Are you?     56. \n[44]Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow. \n[45]I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible? \n[46]Mom? She turns. \n[47]Who is Mr. Penis? \n[48]I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious. \n[49]\" before long, you're running, looking for a place to hide.\" \n[50]Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away. \n[51].o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned. \n[52]I said, \"don't mess with me.\" Just like that.      73. \n[53]\"Don't mess with me.\" Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that? \n[54]It doesn't hurt, I told you.  He saw everything from the roof. Said I did what I had to do. \n[55]He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again... \n[56]God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard. 0 \n[57]I like it long. \n[58]it's almost eight. Dad's late. \n[59]like this?  How do you make a fist? \n[60]Mom's going butcher your hair. \n[61]Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock. Hancock shrugs a \"what can I do.\" \n[62]Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I got to do. \n[63]Mom? Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower. \n[64]my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls. \n[65]Mom.' \n[66]The toast's burnt. \n[67]We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all over the place. \n[68]You forgot the corn...  . ouch! \n[69]You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK. \n[70]Are you all right, mom? \n[71]You're acting weird. \n[72]I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk. \n[73]Hi. \n[74]I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame. \n[75]Where are you going? Can I go? \n[76]Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today...  and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now. \n[77]Dad, are you wasted? \n[78]He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away. \n[79]But dad... \n[80]Thanks, mom. \n[81]Mom. Tomorrow always feel bette r. \n[82]Probably. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd/ \n[83]Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says... \n[84]Don't touch her you bastard! \n[85]No! Mom! \n[86]\n[87]Let me go you bastard.     118. \n[88]Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying. \n[89]I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to do... \n[90]I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry. \n[91]Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. \"What can I do?\" \n[92]Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds? \n[93]\n[94]Mom... Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping over to the building that once was. ", "ROHEIM": "\n[1]stoops, on a stool and from his mou th over his saturated ssleeve. A line of SALIVA dangles employee. Roheim another U-Rent Secu Co. as threatening as a burnt-outmat and \n[2]Olga... \n[3]. bitch. From the dark recesses of sleep - he wakes. Straightens up. Slurps back his dignity. \n[4]What, already? Takes the handkerchief. Wipes his mouth. \n[5]You're a good man. \n[6]I'll just play out the rest of this Eight Ball... He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket. \n[7]like that. Horus looks on - silent.     14. A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled testosterone cases with nothing to do. \n[8]Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of warm spit... couldn't find their asshole with common sense and a thumb.  Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The jerk-offs, they don't got the heart... the sensitivity of a man like you. Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like a thorn in the eye of his soul. \n[9]Come on, let's go home. \n[10]Man. I bet he gets laid. Horus - he looks terrible. \n[11]Olga... He snaps out of it... \n[12].bitch. Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a thinking posture. Horns seems lost in his own blank stare. \n[13]I was talking again, huh?     59. No response. \n[14]. that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there... makes you feel like a man.  Then everything gets blurry and all of a sudden, it's not my arm that's around her and it's not my hand that's touching her and it's not even me, my body. Some guy, this good-looking guy... he looks like the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And so... the Marlboro Man's running his fingers through her hair. And he's... banging her... and her knees... by her ears, you know?  And that look on her face. That look. \n[15]Bitch. \n[16]Walk with me. \n[17]This stuff's going to kill me. He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig. \n[18]You disapprove, I know. \n[19]Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything. \n[20]You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative.  So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp. \n[21]My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this. \n[22]You're a good man, Horus...  And you're right. This stuff's no good. It's a coward's way out and I know it. He gives the bottle a guilty stare. Tosses the bottle into a nearby garbage can. \n[23]What the hell. I can learn to love beverage. \n[24]Figured I can get you by the front... but you weren't there. \n[25]They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back. \n[26]-Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped them'in the fight.  Shit... He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom. \n[27]the old man Look at what they did.. gave a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for shit. \n[28]I'm a waste of time... \n[29]I'm too old for this. \n[30]What am I... I'm biologically challenged. Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.  \n[31]But you know what, Horus. That's all wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't make the man. It's me. Not the uniform. It starts right here... 'cause I can't do anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.  But you. Why do you put up with this crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for you at home. Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.     82. \n[32]They're going to can me. \n[33]Should be an extra key over the door.     83. \n[34]Shoes. The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.     84. \n[35]I don't know. You might have solo act tomorrow night. \n[36]You're a good man, Horus. \n[37]You know what Olga said before she walked out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked around the room and she says, \"keep it clean.\" That's it, can you believe it? Then out the door.  But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place spotless... in case she walks through that door one day.  I don't think she's coming back. \n[38]of him. Holy shit. I think I g Roheim notices the unconscious thugs on the floor. Turns to Horus, measuring him. \n[39]What do you mean, you got to get her? \n[40]Brain damage runs in this family or something? Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness. \n[41]I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's. Aaron ducks into his father's chest. \n[42]Come on, Horus. Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen. Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He r olls up his sleeve and gets to work. Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his midst... surveys the carnage... A loaded beat. Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat. Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his knees... by a fallen police GUN. He picks it up... points it at his head... off skull. Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a surreal sight. Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb. He stops.  126. ", "TOM": "\n[1]You know what, you remind me of my grandma. Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants... \n[2]She gave me this when I made parole. He aims the barrel in her face. \n[3]Thanks, Granny! Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the situation at hand. They begin to panic. On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY , emerge from the crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES. Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun. As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin. The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues. The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with ,Ir\u00e2\u0096\u00ba that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.     19. \n[4]Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. My name is Tom. These are my assistants, Jerry and Jerry. Why're we doing what we're doing, you ask? We got one word to say to you folks...  Recession. \n[5]Thank you, Jerry. Tom is referring to Jerry's demonstration of the lotus Jerry does not respond. \n[6]Thank you, Jerry. \n[7]And while I take care of business, my associates will be making their rounds. The Jerrys leap into action - guns pointing. They rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and collectables. \n[8]Please be cooperative and more importantly, charitable. We'd like you to think of it as donations... for Jerry's kids. Jerry #2 weaves through crowd waving his automatic wand. People dish out valuables into his canvas BAG. He arrives at Mary, motioning at the bag with the rifle. \n[9]Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. She's too scared for speech. But back on the bank floor... \n[10]No heroes! No heroes! Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue. \n[11]Fuck! Fuck! A wave of SIRENS punctuate their state of \"fuck.\" It crescendoes around the building. \n[12]I'm not going back. Mary, amongst the crowd, takes a glance at the CLOCK --one thirty. \n[13]I'm not gonna say it again, Ted!  swiss cheese. All of them! \n[14]I want that car, Ted! \n[15]. a car and I want it NOW! And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance. It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps still reeling from the impact. The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED, the getaway driver  Fred lands on the hood of the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame. SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up. \n[16]Stay away. Hancock does not respond. \n[17]I'm not going back. Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a resounding THUD. They're locked in. \n[18]What're you doing? Hancock does not respond. \n[19]What's going on, here? Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it. \n[20]Answer me! Say something!  Fuck me!     27. BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity. It rips Tom's right EAR from his head. \n[21]Fuck... My shirt. \n[22]Don't. I told you... I'm not going back. \n[23]What's eating you, man? \n[24]Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a rainbow...      28. \n[25]you don't got to shower me with respect. Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have you no mercy, mister? \n[26]Fuck you. Close on his trigger finger. It tightens... ", "CLYDE": "\n[1]Longfella. Good to see you. \n[2]Picked this up for you.  Say thanks. \n[3]You're a good man.     17. He heads inside. Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front page. The headline reads... \n[4]Not now, Longfella. I'm all blocked up. Clyde heads inside - with the sports page.. He FARTS as he goes in. \n[5]The box scores are waiting and I got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy. \n[6]You what? \n[7]All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck. He stutter-steps... KNOCKS... \n[8]What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop taking your sports page. Now get out of \n[9]You what? \n[10]What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You don't even like football. Horus does.not budge. \n[11]You'll get it back... after I take my dump. Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his foot in the door. \n[12]What? \n[13]After I finish. \n[14]What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy? Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm a kamikaze move, indeed. \n[15]Give that back. Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe. \n[16]Why'd you go and do that for? Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the massacre commences. He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if Horns accepted it as fate.     87. Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning, returns to his room. ", "TED": "\n[1]Time's running out, fellas. He turns to his sidekick, CHAD , a fellow cop. Chad's on the phone deliberating an important call. \n[2]The pizza here, yet? \n[3]Ooh, one sec.  Time's... all Hell's gonna break loose, fellas.  My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo... A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity. Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard, tumbles out and onto the sidewalk. Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered - he's probably dead.     24. The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns raised. \n[4]Time's running out, fellas! The hostages grimace, hell not so far away. \n[5]Where's that car, Jesus! \n[6]What the...     25. There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He examines the ground below. And he dives. Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the bank structure, flying around and around. Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft. \n[7]Let the lady go, Hancock. Or all hell's going to break loose. \n[8]Come on out! Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves. He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of healing. Hancock closes in - corners her. \n[9]All HELL'S going to break loose! Hancock recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches his ear. \n[10]You are surrounded. There's no way out of this one... NO WAY OUT! Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes it off. \n[11]I want his balls in a jar... Chad. The others. They take a good look at him. \n[12]in a fucking vice...  this is the END of the line. \n[13]there's NO ESCAPE! \n[14]Where the fuck is Chopper Three? \n[15]Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon.

In unison - their FLASHLIGHTS flick on. \n[9]Take the show upstairs. \n[10]Guys?  Fuck me. He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun. \n[11]You're starting to piss me off. He pushes Horus down the remaining steps. \n[12]Your move... Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin. Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops. strength from god knows where. g Takes dead aim with a tremblin BANG... Horus grimaces... Scarpo drops. .45 (knocked from Roheim steps forward from the darkness, the Horus, earlier) smoking in his hand. Did I get him? Horus. Roheim. They look at Scarpo.

The Cap sounds like he's chewing the rag. \n[11]I don't like the smell of this shit. \n[12]What's with the Cap? Looks like someone just fucked his wife, or something. Nervous smiles from the fellas.

She withdraws her hands. \n[3]But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit... \n[4]Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive. \n[5]I've been waiting. They stare for one horny beat. Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina. \\./ \n[6]Come on, baby. Relax. \n[7]You can. The phone begins to RING - but they're busy. \n[8]Let it go, baby. Just let it... \n[9]. go.

He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of panic, pain. CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies his reaction, now marked with relief. \n[3]What're you doing?     103. \n[4]What're you doing, in there! I'm calli ng the police. Hancock drops his pants. Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right, latches on to his magnanimous member. Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed against wood - listening. So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS... Cue for the reporter to back away. \n[5]Jesus... Hancock stiffens, in full throttle. Full. Throttle... up and into a fevered pitch... and BOOM, we hear a He GROWLS... P baby explosion. The reporter leaps back. Beat. The bathroom door flies open.

Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash can. He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing. That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock's capable arm. In mid-air, they hang for a second.
