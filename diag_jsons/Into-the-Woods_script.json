{"dialogues": {"BAKER": "\n[1]Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom, there lay a small village at the edge of the woods... \n[2]And in this village... \n[3]... lived a young maiden... \n[4]... a care-free young lad... \n[5]... and a childless baker... \n[6]... with his Wife-- \" \n[7]\n[8]\n[9]The poor girl's parents had died-- \n[10]And now she lived with her stepmother... \n[11]...who had two daughters of her own. \n[12]All three were beautiful of face, but vile and black of heart. \n[13]The young lad had no father, and his \n[14]Well, she was at her wit's end-- \n[15]And then there was a hungry little girl who always wore a red cape... \n[16]Hey! \n[17]I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these? \n[18]And you might save some of those sweets for Granny. \n[19]Who might that be? \n[20]It's the Witch from next door! \n[21]Then what is it you wish? \n[22]What are you talking about? \n[23]I had a brother? \n[24]Where is she? \n[25]How could you do that to me? \n[26]I'm so sorry... \n[27]I'm not wearing that. \n[28]It was my father's. You heard what she said. This is all his fault. \n[29]I want nothing to do with him! \n[30]We? Wait a minute! You're not coming. It's not safe out there. \n[31]No. I can do this on my own. \n[32]Now tell me. What am I to return with? \n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]Deep within the woods, Cinderella had planted a branch at the grave of her mother. And she visited there so often, and wept so much, that her tears watered it until it had become a magnificent tree. \n[39]On her path to Granny's, the little girl suddenly found herself in a very unusual part of the wood. \n[40]You frightened me! \n[41]How am I supposed to get it? \n[42]I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it! \n[43]This is ridiculous! \n[44]Hello there little girl. \n[45]Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny? \n[46]So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape? \n[47]Is that right? I would love a red cape like that. \n[48]May I take a look at it? \n[49]I need it badly. \n[50]I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way. \n[51]This is hopeless. I'll never get that red cape or find a golden cow and a yellow slipper -- or was it a golden slipper and a yellow cow? \n[52]What are you doing here? \n[53]You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods! \n[54]No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE-- \n[55]Hello there, young lad. \n[56]What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest? \n[57]And what are you planning to do there? \n[58]Five pounds! Where are we to get five pounds? \n[59]This is all we have... \n[60]Huh? \n[61]Magic that defies description. \n[62]Six. \n[63]Well ... \n[64]...possibly. Here. \n[65]Good luck there, young lad. \n[66]Take the cow and go home! \n[67]Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit? \n[68]Five beans?! \n[69]Of course. But... \n[70]I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father. \n[71]Because of my father. \n[72]I don't know... \n[73]All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own. \n[74]The old enchantress had given the name Rapunzel to the child she had hidden away and locked in a a doorless tower. But little did she know that the girl's lilting voice had caught the attention of a handsome Prince.\" \n[75]As the little girl approached her Granny's oak tree, she was surprised to see the door standing open. \n[76]And with a single bound, the wolf had devoured the little girl. Well, it was a full day of eating for both. \n[77]I can't believe I just did that. \n[78]No thanks! \n[79]I'm a baker. \n[80]You need to be more careful, young lady. \n[81]Are you certain? \n[82]Thank you. Thank you! \n[83]The first night of the festival ball brought Cinderella her wish. The Prince danced only with her, `til he turned and she had slipped away. \n[84]What? \n[85]How would you come by five gold pieces?! \n[86]A giant? \n[87]Milky-White is back home with my wife. \n[88]Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell. \n[89]No, no, no! It's not that-- \n[90]Wait. I didn't say-- \n[91]Hey, come back! \n[92]What are you doing here? \n[93]Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left. \n[94]Two. We've the cape and the cow. \n[95]What have you done with the cow?! \n[96]How could you? \n[97]But she didn't! \n[98]\n[99]We were just going to do that. Here. \n[100]You can have this-- \n[101]I don't like that woman. \n[102]I shouldn't have yelled.  Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls. \n[103]GO!, please -- go. \n[104]As the Baker's Wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the festival was thrown into chaos when Cinderella once again ran from the Prince. \n[105]Moo... Moo...... \n[106]Please, if you would be so kind, may I compare this ear of corn with your hair? \n[107]Milky-White! \n[108]I thought you were returning home! \n[109]Yes. I've the cow. We've two of the four. \n[110]Two. \n[111]Where did you find it? \n[112]Three! \n[113]We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then. \n[114]Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child. \n[115]\n[116]\n[117]Where did you get this? \n[118]No, no, no - it's not how it sounds! \n[119]When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but one day left to reverse the Witch's curse. As for Rapunzel's Prince, he returned yet again to the forbidden tower. \n[120]Jack took the little girl's dare and before he knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant. \n[121]We've only one day left! I don't know where to start. \n[122]Right, where do I buy a cow? \n[123]What are you going to do? \n[124]The yellow slipper? \n[125]Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it? \n[126]You think you could get one? \n[127]Right. Why are we always separating? \n[128]The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk came crashing down, killing the Giant... \n[129]...as for Cinderella, she fled from the Prince... again. \n[130]And in her haste, the Baker's Wife took no notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward. \n[131]As the Prince anxiously waited, the Stepmother took matters -- and Florinda's foot -- into her own hands. \n[132]Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the Prince's horse, unaware of the blood dripping from the slipper. \n[133]Lucinda was next. \n[134]Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to swallow the pain. \n[135]As punishment for their cruelty, Cinderella's birds swooped down upon the Stepsisters... and blinded them. \n[136]As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest. \n[137]Come on! We don't have any time... \n[138]You've got the slipper! \n[139]And the cape as red as blood. \n[140]We've done it! \n[141]We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did. \n[142]And we thought you'd prefer a live cow. \n[143]It's here... \n[144]She's going to bring Milky-White back to life. \n[145]She's a witch! She can do anything! \n[146]It's almost midnight! \n[147]And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn. \n[148]What? \n[149]That was quick! \n[150]And it came to pass, all that seemed wrong was now right. The Witch succeeded in reversing her mother's curse. Cinderella finally stopped running from her Prince. \n[151]Jack was reunited with his beloved cow and his mother could now dress in the best a golden egg could buy. \n[152]And the Baker and his Wife were proud parents of a strapping baby boy. \n[153]And so with the kingdom filled with joy, those who deserved to were destined to live happily ever... \n[154]Are you alright? \n[155]And the baby? \n[156]But as they made their way back into the woods, their familiar paths were nowhere to be found and their lives were about to take an unexpected turn. \n[157]Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase? \n[158]What do you mean? \n[159]We can help you find Granny's without the path. \n[160]Why does he always cry when I hold him? \n[161]He doesn't want me. He wants his mother! \n[162]I'll take care of him -- when he's older... \n[163]It's the Steward and the royal family. \n[164]What brings you into the woods? \n[165]What is the Royal family going to do? \n[166]A giant woman! \n[167]We haven't seen him. \n[168]Don't upset the Giant! \n[169]Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together. \n[170]Okay, I promise. \n[171]We're never going to find him. \n[172]No. You can't be on your own. \n[173]What if we get lost? \n[174]You would leave our son with her? \n[175]But what if the Giant comes back... \n[176]Wait! Take this. It might be cold. \n[177]Four eighty two... four eighty three... Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen a boy... (notices she is \n[178]Oh. I'm sorry. \n[179]Earthquake? It's no earthquake -- there's a giant terrorizing the kingdom! \n[180]Hah, the Prince? No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden. \n[181]You look just like the Princess -- but dirty. Oh no, you are the Princess! \n[182]I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. \n[183]If you'd like you can come with me. You will be safe in our company. \n[184]This way. \n[185]She should be back by now. \n[186]No, I must go and look for her-- \n[187]Let go of him! \n[188]\n[189]Where did you find this? \n[190]It's my wife's! \n[191]What are you saying? \n[192]No. No...! \n[193]This is my fault. I let her wander off alone. I should have made her stay with me. \n[194]My wife is dead! \n[195]Yes! He's the one to blame! It's because of you there's a giant in our midst and my wife is dead! \n[196]\n[197]\n[198]\n[199]\n[200]\n[201]\n[202]\n[203]\n[204]\n[205]\n[206]\n[207]\n[208]\n[209]Yes. Maybe you shouldn't have... \n[210]Away from here. \n[211]It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart. \n[212]You don't understand. My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything. \n[213]He'll be happier in the arms of a Princess... \n[214]What are you doing here? \n[215]I don't want to talk to you. It's because of you all of this happened. Go away! \n[216]Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans? \n[217]-- Selfish. \n[218]You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away. \n[219]... and your son. \n[220]If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it. \n[221]Then what do you want? \n[222]Give me my son. \n[223]close to comfort \n[224]We need to rid this kingdom of the Giant -- together. \n[225]She'll be back soon; here's the plan. We're going to feed Jack to the Giant. \n[226]We're going to use you as bait to lure the Giant towards the tar pit. \n[227]Okay, we don't have much time. \n[228]Here's what we're going to do... \n[229]Careful, there. Not so fast. \n[230]Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother... \n[231]She didn't make it. \n[232]No. It wasn't like that. She was fighting with the Giant, trying to protect you, and she was pushed by the Steward -- and -- she fell. \n[233]No, Jack -- \n[234]You'll do nothing of the kind. \n[235]It's not as easy as that. \n[236]\n[237]\n[238]\n[239]\n[240]\n[241]\n[242]\n[243]\n[244]Go, Jack! Be careful. \n[245]Ready? \n[246]Jack, Jack! \n[247]Jack, I'm here. \n[248]Are you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. \n[249]Now we can all return home. \n[250]\n[251]-- of course you can come home with me. \n[252]If you want to. \n[253]Here -- give him to me. \n[254]Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey, please, come on, come on, it's okay. I know you miss your mother. \n[255]I miss her too. \n[256]Sssh! \n[257]\n[258]\n[259]\n[260]\n[261]Shhhh. \n[262]", "WIFE": "\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]You're certain of your way? \n[4]Now, don't stray and be late! \n[5]We've sold our last loaf of bread! \n[6]We have no bread. \n[7]What curse? \n[8]Lost what? \n[9]Here. Take this... \n[10]Why? \n[11]Look! \n[12]Beans. The Witch's beans! We'll take them with us. \n[13]I can help you. \n[14]You don't remember?! \n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]You forgot your scarf. \n[19]I want to help. \n[20]\n[21]A cow as white as ... \n[22]What are you planning to do there? \n[23]She must be generous of milk to fetch five pounds? \n[24]And if you can't fetch that sum? Then what are you to do? \n[25]Beans? We mustn't give up our beans! Well, if you feel we must... \n[26]Oh, these are no ordinary beans, son. These beans carry...magic. \n[27]Tell him! \n[28]Five! They're worth a pound each, at least. \n[29]Yes. \n[30]I was just trying to help. \n[31]No one would have given him more for this creature. We did him a favor. At least they'll have some food. \n[32]Do we want a child or not? \n[33]We have one chance. Don't you see that? And if we fail... \n[34]Why do you say that? \n[35]You're not him. \n[36]If you can't do this for yourself, can't you at least do it for me? \n[37]Are you alright, miss? \n[38]What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? \n[39]Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? \n[40]\n[41]I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before! \n[42]If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide. \n[43]Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods. He's undoing a spell. \n[44]Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what was he like? \n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n[48]\n[49]\n[50]\n[51]\n[52]\n[53]\n[54]But why would you run away? \n[55]Princes, castles, gowns... \n[56]But you will return to the Festival tomorrow eve? \n[57]You don't know? What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes. (looking to her \n[58]Wait! I need your shoes! \n[59]Milky-White! \n[60]Already?! \n[61]Well... \n[62]I see you've got the red cape! \n[63]Three. \n[64]You've the cape... \n[65]She ran away. I never reached home. I've been looking for her all night. \n[66]She might just as easily have run from you! \n[67]\n[68]I'm sorry I lost the cow. \n[69]Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. \n[70]\n[71]Excuse me for this. \n[72]I have no idea, sir. \n[73]I was trying to hold her here for you... \n[74]Yes, of course. \n[75]Oh! It's you! And you've the cow! \n[76]Three. \n[77]Three! \n[78]Compare this to your corn. \n[79]I pulled it from a maiden in a tower. \n[80]And I almost had the fourth, but she got away. \n[81]We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you? \n[82]\n[83]\n[84]A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg. \n[85]Five gold pieces? \n[86]Where are the five gold pieces? \n[87]You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy. \n[88]You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there. \n[89]I'm going to get the slipper. \n[90]The GOLDEN slipper! \n[91]I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights. \n[92]Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here. \n[93]Because we have to if we're going to be together... \n[94]What is happening? \n[95]Please, stop! Just hear me out! \n[96]I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean in exchange for it. \n[97]Wait, please. I haven't much time! I need that shoe to have a child. \n[98]Does it make sense that you're running from a prince? \n[99]\n[100]Thank you! Thank you! \n[101]It's mine. \n[102]I don't care if this costs me my life... \n[103]Please give me the slipper, kind Prince, and all will come to a happy end. \n[104]Thank you. Thank you! \n[105]I've found you!  You've got the cow! \n[106]We've all four! \n[107]And the hair as yellow as corn. \n[108]We've got them all. \n[109]Of course she is. \n[110]She has to be! \n[111]What? You didn't get a real white cow? \n[112]She's dead. \n[113]We're running out of time! \n[114]What? \n[115]Wait! We followed your instructions. One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct? \n[116]And two, the cape was certainly as red as blood. \n[117]And three, the slipper-- \n[118]I pulled it from a maiden in a tower \n[119]Well, nothing. I happened to be \n[120]It's working! \n[121]Thanks for the slipper. \n[122]I think so. \n[123]Yes, he's fine. \n[124]What's happened? Everything's so different. \n[125]Calm down. \n[126]Yes. \n[127]Please take him for a few moments. \n[128]You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. \n[129]I can't take care of him all of the time. \n[130]Who might that be? \n[131]No! \n[132]I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. \n[133]You come with us. \n[134]It's a giant! \n[135]Look! What have you done to her? \n[136]We should fan out. It'll increase our chances. \n[137]I'll be all right. \n[138]We'll count our steps from right here. \n[139]No. You stay with the baby. \n[140]Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl. \n[141]See? \n[142]What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! \n[143]One, two... \n[144]One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled; Hello, Your Royal Highness. \n[145]You must be here to slay the Giant. \n[146]Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst. Not an earthquake... \n[147]Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh? \n[148]I came with my husband. We were ... well you see ... it's a long story. \n[149]No, actually it was my choice. \n[150]Brave? \n[151]\n[152]\n[153]Wait one moment, please! We can't do this! You have a Princess! \n[154]And I have a...baker. \n[155]But this is not right! \n[156]What was that?/ WAS THAT ME?/ WAS THAT \n[157]\n[158]\n[159]\n[160]\n[161]\n[162]One eighty-four... one eighty-three... one eighty-two... \n[163]\n[164]\n[165]\n[166]", "JACK": "\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk. \n[7]\n[8]Bullseye! \n[9]Mother, no-- he's the best cow in the \n[10]But Milky-White is my best friend! \n[11]\n[12]Why do I have to go to the next village? \n[13]But that's cheating. \n[14]Yes. \n[15]No more than five pounds. \n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]Hello, sir. \n[20]I was heading toward market -- but I seem to have lost my way. \n[21]Sell my cow, sir. No less than five pounds. \n[22]Yes, ma'am. \n[23]I hadn't thought of that... \n[24]Beans in exchange for my cow? \n[25]Magic? What kind of magic? \n[26]How many beans? \n[27]Could I buy my cow back someday? \n[28]One day, I'll buy you back -- Promise! \n[29]But they're magic -- the man said -- \n[30]Mother -- no! \n[31]Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker! \n[32]Good fortune! Good fortune, sir! Look what I have! Five gold pieces. \n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]So, here's your money, sir! Five gold pieces. Where is my Milky-White? \n[45]Let's go find them! \n[46]But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money? \n[47]You keep that. I'll fetch some more. \n[48]Stop it! Stop my egg! \n[49]Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White. And the owners. And my egg! \n[50]From the Giant's hen! \n[51]And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces. \n[52]Now I'm taking my cow. \n[53]You said I could have my cow! \n[54]Milky-White...! \n[55]Milky-White is dead! \n[56]Hey there - nice cape! \n[57]Whoa! I don't want it. Where did you get it? \n[58]Well, look what I have! A golden egg. \n[59]I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant. \n[60]It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it. \n[61]I could. \n[62]I could! \n[63]I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see! \n[64]There is? \n[65]But Mother, look. The most beautiful harp. \n[66]What's happening? \n[67]She can do that? \n[68]Wow! \n[69]Milky-White. You're back! I missed you so much! \n[70]I'll do it. She'll only milk for me. \n[71]Squeeze, pal! You can do it. \n[72]The corn! The corn! \n[73]You can use the silky hair of the corn-- \n[74]She's milking! \n[75]You're hurting me! \n[76]Make her stop! \n[77]I'm sorry, sir... \n[78]I'm sorry. I came upon her.
