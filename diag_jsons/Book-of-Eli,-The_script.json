{"dialogues": {"ELI": "\n[1]Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast. \n[2]Thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for bringing me this far. I know my long journey's end is near. I ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won't let you down. Amen. \n[3]Hey. You hungry? \n[4]Come on now. \n[5]I'm not going to hurt you. \n[6]Here. \n[7]One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off. \n[8]Nothing. \n[9]I can't do that. \n[10]It's real important you boys listen to me and understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I'm under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful instrument. \n[11]Something like that. \n[12]I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back. \n[13]He's in shock. He means \"kill him\". \n[14]I told you you wouldn't be getting that back. \n[15]My name is Eli. \n[16]Take it and go on your way. And don't fall in with men like these again. No good can come. \n[17]God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. \n[18]Through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen. \n[19]There are no good men on the road. \n[20]West. \n[21]No. \n[22]It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. \n[23]You got an engineer or a fuelman around here? \n[24]Thanks. \n[25]I'm not from around here. \n[26]I'm just a customer. \n[27]No. I'll set it down. Okay? \n[28]I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on the road a long time. \n[29]I'm not a- \n[30]I'm not one of them. \n[31]I'm just passing through. I need some help. I can pay. \n[32]I'm going to get something out of my pack. Okay? \n[33]I know, I know. Slowly. \n[34]Years ago, in the outland back east aways. \n[35]Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can you do it? I got the cables. \n[36]I'll wait here. \n[37]I don't know you. \n[38]What's this place across the street? They got any water? \n[39]I'll be back. \n[40]If that battery ain't here when I get back, I will use this gun on your kneecaps and I will put this building to the torch and I will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it. So help me God. \n[41]Water. \n[42]That's the best I got. \n[43]Fine specimen. \n[44]I didn't push him. \n[45]Sorry. It won't happen again. \n[46]I don't want any trouble. \n[47]I know you. Murderer of innocent travelers on the road. You're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done. Did you know that? \n[48]You go on back to your table and I'll be on my way. All right? \n[49]Cursed be the ground because of you. By toil shall you eat of it. Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. From the ground were you taken. For dust you are. \n[50]And to dust you shall return. \n[51]Go. \n[52]It ain't for me to judge you. Your time for that's gonna come. Believe me. Now go on. Get out of here. \n[53]Thank you. \n[54]I'm sorry for all the mess. \n[55]Nobody. A walker in the outland. \n[56]I had a battery needed charging and a canteen needed filling. I didn't come here looking for trouble. \n[57]No. \n[58]That's you out there on the street. \n[59]You had slaves build you a monument to yourself? \n[60]It's none of my business what you do here. Like you said, it's your town. I just want to be on my way. \n[61]I read every day. \n[62]What do you want with me?  \n[63]What?  \n[64]I'm not interested.  \n[65]I'm not your friend. And I'm not staying. I got someplace I need to be. Out west.  \n[66]I've been told different.    \n[67]Thank you for your offer. But I'd prefer to just leave right now. So you can either let me out of here, or I can kill my way out. \n[68]How's my battery? \n[69]How much longer? \n[70]You remember what I said would happen if I came back here and you didn't have my battery? \n[71]Yeah? How'd you know that? \n[72]So you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer? \n[73]Hello? \n[74]Oh. Thank you. \n[75]No, thank you. \n[76]You're Carnegie's woman? \n[77]Just making conversation is all. Haven't had one of those in a while. Not a real one, leastways. \n[78]You had a baby? \n[79]It's all right. \n[80]You want to eat some? \n[81]When did you go blind? In the war? You get caught in a flash? \n[82]Lucky? \n[83]So did I. \n[84]Come in. \n[85]Someone was already here with food and water. I got everything I need. \n[86]No. My name's Eli. \n[87]Elijah. \n[88]Look, I don't mean to be rude. But I'm really not interested. \n[89]It's not that. You're a very nice girl. But I'm not that kind of man. \n[90]I'm not. \n[91]I'm sorry. Good night. \n[92]If you don't, what? \n[93]Who will? Carnegie? \n[94]Maybe he and I oughta have words. \n[95]He's hurting you. He's hurting your mother. He's- \n[96]You want to have a conversation? \n[97]You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. What happened down there in the bar... \n[98]How'd you know that? \n[99]You know, I don't rightly remember. \n[100]Better than this. People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more than a hundred years old. \n[101]I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's not the same. If you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road. \n[102]Can I read you something? \n[103]Not just any book. \n[104]The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness. \n[105]Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. \n[106]No. \n[107]I guess you could think of it that way. It's from the Holy Bible. \n[108]It's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. I guess it's about a little bit of everything. \n[109]I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect this book. I can't trust it with anyone. Not even for a while. \n[110]It's the last one. There are no other books like this. All the others are gone - destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. This is the only one that survived until now. The last one anywhere. \n[111]I just know. For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now. \n[112]It led me to this place, I don't really know where. And I found this book buried deep under some rubble. No way no-one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look. \n[113]That's right. And that voice told me to carry the book west. \n[114]It told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith. That was twenty-five years ago. And I've been walking ever since. \n[115]I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it. I know what I heard. \n[116]A very important, very powerful man. \n[117]I should say so, yes. \n[118]What? \n[119]I think you're probably right. \n[120]I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow. And I won't be back this way, ever. \n[121]Are you hungry? \n[122]There's some food on the table over there. Let's eat. \n[123]It's okay, it's okay. He's with me. Don't be afraid, pal. This is Solara. She's our friend. \n[124]It's okay. It means he likes you. \n[125]Trust me, if he didn't like you, you'd know about it. \n[126]Mean what? \n[127]Sure. \n[128]Our father, we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us. \n[129]We thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this. And we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times. \n[130]Amen. You say that last part too. \n[131]And now we eat. \n[132]It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. \n[133]Dammit... \n[134]Let her go. \n[135]I reckon you're right. \n[136]This, though? With this I'll shave the hairs clean off your balls at a hundred paces. You believe me? \n[137]No. \n[138]The Lord himself told me that if I carried this book west, one day I would find the place where it was needed. Where it would be safe. Where it belonged. \n[139]But this ain't it. \n[140]Come on. \n[141]You shall not make for yourself any graven image... \n[142]Now we can go. \n[143]I told you where I'm going. You're free to go wherever you want. \n[144]You're only going to slow me down. \n[145]The man was hurting you. I don't like that, so I put a stop to it. Now you're free. He can't hurt you any more. No need to thank me. \n[146]Whatever you want. That's what being free is. \n[147]I have to get where I'm going. I can't be worrying about someone else along the way. \n[148]It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt. \n[149]You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone. \n[150]I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town. \n[151]I offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. Will you say with me the act of contrition? \n[152]Some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. Let you die slow in the sun. But I know better. I know where you're going. And the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you. \n[153]Repeat after me. Oh God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins. \n[154]I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, and do penance, and to amend my life. Amen. \n[155]What are friends for? \n[156]This is the deal. You keep up. You pull your weight. You fall behind, I can't help you. Okay? \n[157]There's nothing can be done for her. \n[158]It's good eating, is what it is. \n[159]If you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. You eat what's there to eat. \n[160]More for me. \n[161]Father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. Bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen. \n[162]Tastes like chicken. \n[163]It's a Saint Christopher medal. \n[164]Christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry. \n[165]Then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that's how he became a saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers. \n[166]It's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. Enough that God himself took a special interest in them. \n[167]No. Not like me. Saints ain't killers. And I done too much of that. Spilled too much blood. \n[168]It's late. You should get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow. \n[169]What are you doing? \n[170]On the road you sleep with one eye open. I asked you what you were doing. \n[171]You want to see the book, you ask me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever. Until it gets where it's going. Do you understand? \n[172]Tell me you understand! \n[173]It's no use to you anyway. You don't know how to read it. \n[174]Maybe. Get some sleep. \n[175]No. \n[176]I told you. My path has been laid out before me. \n[177]By Almighty God. \n[178]You want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again. \n[179]God has a reason for everything being the way it is. It's not always apparent to us. But it is his plan nonetheless. \n[180]It's not like that. It's kinda hard to explain. I'm guided by faith. \n[181]It means you know something even though you don't know it. \n[182]It doesn't have to. \n[183]I don't know. \n[184]Stay behind me. \n[185]Yeah. \n[186]Shit. \n[187]My name is Eli. This is Solara. We're travelers, that's all. We don't mean you any harm. \n[188]I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody lived here. We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest. \n[189]No, sir. I... like what you've done with the place. \n[190]No business. We're sorry to have troubled you. If you'll let us down we'll happily be on our way. \n[191]It's.. uh... \n[192]Have you always lived here? \n[193]I don't understand how you've survived out here this long. \n[194]We have to get out of here. \n[195]They're worse than that. \n[196]They didn't just kill these people. They ate them. \n[197]There's a disease in the outland. Spread by eating human meat. It affects the brain. Dementia, loss of motor function. Did you notice the old woman's hands shaking? She's got it. They've both got it. \n[198]We really must be going. \n[199]Yes, I'm afraid so. \n[200]Yes. Thank you again for the tea. \n[201]Are you sure? \n[202]Back inside. \n[203]Hand me my pack. \n[204]It's all right. We're going to be all right. Trust me. \n[205]You remember what I told you about faith? \n[206]We're going to get out of this alive. Both of us. I know. \n[207]Because God told me. \n[208]He didn't mention you. \n[209]Solara? \n[210]Are you all right? \n[211]Come on. We're going out the back. We're running. \n[212]Solara... \n[213]You're wrong. \n[214]I told you we'd both live. Now do you have faith? \n[215]Thought you'd gone back to town. \n[216]For what? \n[217]You did what you believed you had to. \n[218]I forgive you. \n[219]Thank you. \n[220]Same as always. Keep heading west. \n[221]But I still have my faith. \n[222]It's grass. It used to grow all over the place. \n[223]I don't know. Less poison in the air this near to the ocean, maybe. \n[224]Nothing. Just a cramp. \n[225]Do you smell that? \n[226]Salt in the air. We're close to the ocean. We're almost there. \n[227]Come on. \n[228]Watch your footing. Step where I step. \n[229]What's left of it. \n[230]Do you see that? \n[231]That's it. \n[232]My name is Elijah Stone. I have a message for your boss. I need you to tell him that I have a King James Bible in my possession. \n[233]Elijah Stone. \n[234]Been carrying it with me for twenty- five years. \n[235]I was sent here by God. \n[236]It's a little beat-up. But it'll do the job. \n[237]Is there someplace we could sit? \n[238]Do you have something you can write with? \n[239]Bring a lot of it. \n[240]Are you ready? \n[241]Pay close attention and write down every word exactly as I say it. \n[242]The First Book of Moses called Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Verse two. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Verse three. And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. \n[243]Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. Thank you for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles in my path. And for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost. \n[244]Thank you for your protection and for your many signs along the way. \n[245]Thank you for the good that I have done. For whatever light you were able to shine into the darkness of this world through me. \n[246]Thank you for the friend I made. \n[247]Please watch over her as you watched over me. \n[248]Thank you for allowing me finally to rest. I'm so very tired. The time of my departure is at hand and now I surrender my soul into your care, at peace in knowing that I have carried out your will. That I have done right with my time on this earth. \n[249]I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. \n[250]I have kept the faith. ", "SOLARA": "\n[1]Stop! \n[2]Please don't. \n[3]Hi. Can I come in? \n[4]You sure about that? \n[5]It's too bright in here. Mind if I turn it down a little? \n[6]That's better. I'm Solara. You're Walker, right? \n[7]That short for something? Elias? \n[8]Elijah. I never heard that one before. It's kinda cute. \n[9]You sure about that? It gets mighty lonely out there on the road. \n[10]If you're worried about money, this is all paid for. The whole night. \n[11]They're all that kind of man. \n[12]They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were right. \n[13]Please don't make me leave. I have to stay the night. If I don't... \n[14]He'll hurt my mom. \n[15]No! Please, don't! \n[16]He's my dad. \n[17]Look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. We don't have to do anything. I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I'll be no trouble, I swear. \n[18]I'm not afraid of you. I know you didn't start that trouble. When I first saw you, I knew you weren't the type to go looking for it. \n[19]My mom says I'm a good judge of character. She says I can read people. That I know a good man when I see one. \n[20]So... you're pretty old, right? \n[21]I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't seen too many people your age. How old are you exactly? \n[22]But you're old enough. I mean, you remember what it was like? In the world before? \n[23]What was it like? \n[24]Come on. \n[25]So how come you have? \n[26]Wait. You can read? \n[27]And you have a book? \n[28]That's beautiful. Did you write that? \n[29]What book is it from? Is it poetry? \n[30]I never heard of it. What's it about? \n[31]Can I see? \n[32]What? I'm not going to do anything. \n[33]What's so special about that book? \n[34]How can you know that? \n[35]What did it say? \n[36]But you knew because the voice told you? \n[37]Because a voice you heard in your head told you to. \n[38]So who was it? The voice? \n[39]More powerful than my dad? \n[40]Would you teach me to read? \n[41]I never learned. No-one around here knows how. Only my dad, and he won't teach me. I think he likes being the only one who can read. I think it makes him feel powerful. \n[42]So would you teach me? \n[43]I guess a little. \n[44]It does? \n[45]Did you really mean that? \n[46]That I'm your friend. \n[47]Amen. And now we eat? \n[48]Morning, dad. \n[49]I did like you asked. Isn't that what you really want to know? Just come out and say it. \n[50]No. We didn't talk much. \n[51]I don't know. He said he had to go. \n[52]That's all he said. That he was going to be leaving this morning. \n[53]Our father, thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us. \n[54]Thank you for my mother. Please watch over her and keep her safe. \n[55]Thank you for all the- \n[56]You did. \n[57]Eli taught me. \n[58]The walker. That's his name. \n[59]He had them written down in a book. \n[60]I don't remember! It was an old leather book. It had kind of a... thing on the front of it. \n[61]That's what it was. A holy bible. Daddy, what's wrong? Did I... \n[62]What? What is it? \n[63]Where are we going? \n[64]Wait... I'm not coming with you? \n[65]So what the hell was all that about back there? \n[66]Thank you? For what? What am I supposed to do now? \n[67]Whatever I want. Except go with you. \n[68]I thought you were my friend. \n[69]I'll be safe so long as I'm with you. I know it. \n[70]If I came with you, I wouldn't be alone. And neither would you. \n[71]Fine! I'll do just that! I had a life there! A family! I didn't ask you to save me! I didn't ask you for anything! \n[72]Fine. \n[73]Shit. Shit. \n[74]Where the hell am I? \n[75]Are you all right? \n[76]You look like you need some help. \n[77]It'll just take a minute. \n[78]You came back for me. \n[79]Okay. \n[80]What about her? \n[81]You killed it! That cute little thing! \n[82]That's not funny. \n[83]I'm not eating that. \n[84]What does that taste like? \n[85]What is that? \n[86]Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a character from your book? \n[87]What is a saint, anyway? \n[88]Someone like you. \n[89]Will you read me some more from the book? \n[90]Eli? \n[91]You scared me! I thought you were asleep. \n[92]I just wanted to see the book. \n[93]Okay! I understand! Ow! \n[94]Well... now we have the time, maybe you can teach me. \n[95]You say you've been walking for twenty-five years. Have you ever considered that you might be lost? \n[96]But how can you know? How can you know this is the right way? \n[97]Yeah, but laid out by who? \n[98]Well if this God guy's so mighty, how come it's taking you so long to get where you're going? Doesn't he know the way? \n[99]Sorry. \n[100]So, is he talking to you right now? Telling you where to go? \n[101]I don't know what that word means. \n[102]That doesn't make any sense at all. \n[103]I don't get it. It looks almost... normal. Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here? \n[104]Maybe we should look inside. There might be food. \n[105]This is weird. \n[106]What? \n[107]It's very good. \n[108]Are these... graves? \n[109]They look so sweet... I would never have believed they were killers. \n[110]What? \n[111]They what? \n[112]Oh my God... \n[113]No! Thank you! \n[114]Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men. \n[115]I recognize the cars. \n[116]Where did you get all this stuff? \n[117]My daddy showed me once. \n[118]I never rode a bike. \n[119]What are we going to do? \n[120]Because God told you? \n[121]Eli! \n[122]I'm fine. \n[123]Oh God... \n[124]Wait! \n[125]It's here! I've got it! Please don't kill him. \n[126]It's just a book, Eli. No book is worth giving up your life for. \n[127]He said he would hurt my mom. If I didn't help him. \n[128]I want you to let him go. \n[129]You've got what you came for. You don't need him. Let him go. \n[130]If you hurt him, I'm not coming back with you. You'll have to drag me kicking and screaming. \n[131]Come on, come on... \n[132]No... No! \n[133]Eli! Eli! \n[134]Eli... \n[135]I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so sorry. \n[136]For what? I betrayed you! I gave them the book! \n[137]You're not mad at me? \n[138]Here. I thought you might still need this. \n[139]What are you going to do now? \n[140]Why? I mean, you don't have the book any more. \n[141]What's that? \n[142]How come it's here? \n[143]What's wrong? \n[144]What? \n[145]Smell what? \n[146]This... this is the world before? \n[147]I see it. Is that it? \n[148]Solara. \n[149]I, uh, I think it's Japanese. \n[150]You turned the whole prison into a library? \n[151]Thanks. \n[152]But I gotta do what I gotta do. \n[153]Home. ", "CARNEGIE": "\n[1]What is it? \n[2]How bad is it? \n[3]How long? \n[4]Halve the rations. \n[5]So halve them again! \n[6]I want you all to remember how far we've come together. And how far we still can go, if only we believe. When I brought us here to this oasis - this promised land - we knew there would be hardships. Knew there would be sacrifices. But we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders. \n[7]And I want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town... but faith. \n[8]It is our faith that sustains us, brothers and sisters! Hallelujah! \n[9]And mark me, the ultimate validation of that faith is coming! The sacred Word of Our Lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! For the Almighty Himself has spoken unto me and promised it! \n[10]In the meantime, He has asked us all to be patient. To walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. And to do that, we must give just a little more. Water rations will be halved until further notice. \n[11]I understand your frustration. The road to salvation is a difficult one - but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine. \n[12]I know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action. It was faith that built this town - and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead. But it is always darkest before dawn - and the new dawn is coming. May God go with you all. \n[13]Of course they did, the bar's open. Outlanders, always looking for answers at the bottom of a bottle. \n[14]Get them up here now. \n[15]Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to see you again! I understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one? \n[16]Well, let's see, shall we? \n[17]No. No. No. No. No. \n[18]It's not here. \n[19]When you bring me the book I asked you for, it'll be worth something. \n[20]Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you once again to take the long view here. When we find this book - and believe me, we will find it - we are going to build a new world. A world far greater, far more righteous than this one. And you and I are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation! \n[21]And you know, I think you're absolutely right. \n[22]That is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. A whole lot more. \n[23]The book I want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. Once there were millions of copies - you only need to find one! Find it and bring it here. And I promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine. \n[24]Not one of them can read. How would they even know when they found it? \n[25]Put them with the others. \n[26]More books came in from the road today. \n[27]And it'll be a while longer. Just another pile of useless junk. If we don't find the right one soon - if I can't give these people what they want to hear... \n[28]Faith? Is that what you think we're missing around here? \n[29]My old man used to have faith. He had it in spades. My mother, too. \n[30]You know where it got them? You know where it got me? \n[31]Faith is for the weak. It's for them out there, the sheep. This world is what you can see and touch and taste. It's what you make it. All these years with me, you still don't have any grasp of that? What's wrong with you, woman? \n[32]No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Hey. You okay? \n[33]You just get me all riled up with that kind of talk. It's not what I need from you right now. You know what I need right now? \n[34]Did you hear that? What was that? \n[35]What in the hell is going on? \n[36]Get your asses out here! \n[37]Hold it right there. \n[38]So, who are you? \n[39]I've met walkers before. Not a particularly civilized bunch. Some have even taken to eating their own kind, did you know that? You wouldn't be one of those savages now, would you? \n[40]Good. This is a civilized town. Under God. Do you know what that means? \n[41]It means we have laws here. Laws set down long before any of us ever walked this earth. And one of them is, you don't eat the flesh of your brother. Else you're no better than an animal. And not welcome here. \n[42]So what's your business here, friend? Walkers don't usually come into town less they want something. \n[43]Well, you sure as hell found it. Do you know who I am? \n[44]My name's Carnegie. I own this bar. I own the whole town. You've never heard of me? \n[45]Remarkable likeness, isn't it? You'd never guess half the men who built it were blind. A small tribute from a grateful people. I was deeply touched. \n[46]Don't call them slaves. That's an old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm trying to help these people. \n[47]In the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals. Here at least they're protected. They do the essential work others don't want. And in return they eat, they drink, they survive. Last year, a couple of them even got married - performed the ceremony myself. You see, I'm not exploiting these people - I'm saving them! Any one of them is free to leave whenever they wish. But here they stay. And they thank me every single day for their salvation! \n[48]What's your name, walker? \n[49]All right, I guess we just call you Walker. Don't see too many folks your age these days. You lived in the world before? You can read? \n[50]That's good. Good man. We educated folk, we need to stick together, if we're ever going to rebuild this world. People like you and me, we're the future.  \n[51]Straight to the point. I like that. Fact is, you could be in a lot of trouble. This is a peaceful town. You walk in here, armed, and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead. I've hanged men for less. I could hang you. Or, you could come work for me.  \n[52]I never once saw anyone handle themselves the way you did down there in that bar. I don't know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it.  \n[53]People who work for me can live better than any walker ever dreamed. Real beds, clean water, hot food. Women, even. You could do a lot worse, my friend.  \n[54]West? There is nothing west. It's all gone, a long time ago.  \n[55]By who? \n[56]All right, look. I'm going to make you an offer of goodwill. Stay the night, think it over. Try a little local hospitality. We'll talk again in the morning. If you're still not interested, you're free to go. No hard feelings. \n[57]Let him go. \n[58]I knew you'd reconsider. \n[59]None of the walkers I've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. I mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half- fried from eating each other - it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. But I never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered. \n[60]Engineer? I don't know what you're talking about. If there's something wrong, maybe I can help. \n[61]This is Redridge. He's kind of my right-hand man around here. \n[62]He'll show you to your room. \n[63]You took your time in there. How long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water? \n[64]Oh? What about? \n[65]He tell you anything about him? \n[66]Yeah, I got that. \n[67]What makes you say that? \n[68]Well, we'll just see about that. \n[69]Who said anything about me? I'm sending Solara. \n[70]You know how often these walkers get laid? Never. Least not by anything living or willing. Girl like her can be very persuasive. \n[71]You went in there readily enough. \n[72]She's a grown woman now, Claudia. Sooner or later you're going to have to accept that. She has to earn her keep around here, same as the rest of us. \n[73]We've each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world. Some people's gift is more evident than others. Solara's sure as hell is. \n[74]I'm the kind of man who'd pull a helpless blind girl off the road, a girl who'd been beaten and raped, and give her a place where she can live without fear! Without me you'd be just another no-eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards, or shoveling dirt down there with the others. That's the kind of man I am! \n[75]Where are you going? \n[76]You're not going to let me? Nobody tells me what I can and can't do in my own town. Nobody. I built this world, and I am God here! So don't go thinking about screwing with my plans. You know how this works. Solara goes against me, you get hurt. You go against me, she gets hurt. \n[77]So let's not see anybody get hurt. Okay? \n[78]Good morning, Solara. \n[79]I said good morning, Solara. \n[80]How was your night? Did you sleep well? \n[81]You don't speak to your father like that. When I ask you a civil question, I expect a civil answer. \n[82]Did he say anything? \n[83]Well, do you think you managed to change his mind about staying? \n[84]So he did talk? What else did he say? Come on, I want all of it! \n[85]We'll see. This is my town, nobody leaves until I say they leave. \n[86]Solara... \n[87]Solara! \n[88]What the hell are you doing? \n[89]God didn't put this food on the table. Do you hear me? Who put this food on the table? \n[90]I said who put this food on the table? \n[91]Who taught you that? \n[92]Who the hell is Eli? \n[93]And he taught you how to say those words? How did he know them? \n[94]What kind of a book? \n[95]Show me. \n[96]He had a bible? \n[97]Something wrong? Something wrong? The walker's gone! \n[98]He jumped out the window, you idiot! You didn't think to put a man outside the fucking window? Find him. Now! \n[99]Go! Go! \n[100]That cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net. I don't reckon you can hit me without hitting her. \n[101]I believe you. I have to say I'm surprised to hear that language coming from you, though. I mean, you being a holy man and all. \n[102]She told me all about it. Told me all about the bible, too. Can I see it? \n[103]You know, I've been searching for a book like that one for years. All I've ever wanted was to bring the word of God to these poor unfortunates here. To shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in. Something to live for! It's why I built this town, did you know that? All we've been missing is the word to show us the way. And now, praise the Lord, you've brought it to us. \n[104]It's not right to keep that book hidden away, all to yourself. The word is meant to be shared with others. It's meant to be spread! Isn't that what you want? I could help you do that. You and me, we could do it together. \n[105]Thank you, darling. \n[106]You know, I always thought of myself as a shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my flock. But all the things I want to do, I can't do them on my own. The one thing I've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. Then one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and then walks right on out again. \n[107]I want you to put a crew together and go out after him. \n[108]I'm not interested in him any more. I only want the book he's carrying. \n[109]You have no idea. You're too young, you don't remember the world before. But I do. I remember. \n[110]When I was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. My mother, she'd read it along with this smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. Like magic. She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was born with. He made sure he beat it into me good. \n[111]Don't you see? It's not just any book. \n[112]It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them. Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book. That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it. \n[113]Oh, it'll do much more than that. The water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. They'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they'll do whatever I tell them. \n[114]Oh, it'll say what I want, I can promise you that. Because I'm going to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be. A new bible, for a new world. \n[115]What do you think, darling? A whole new world, to do with as we will. Won't that be grand? \n[116]Find that book. \n[117]So use the motor pool. \n[118]Whatever there is, use it. \n[119]Right. Right. Of course. Bring her back, too, if you can. But- \n[120]Did you get it? \n[121]Show me. \n[122]The new world begins here... \n[123]What the fuck is this? \n[124]You told me once that you know how to read this. This blind language. \n[125]You're going to read it for me. Every word. And I'm going to write it down. Start at the beginning. \n[126]God fucking dammit! \n[127]Just go. Just get out of my sight.

But we're already- \n[4]We just halved `em last- \n[5]You're going to have to say something. Folks were none too happy last time. Gonna be worse now, you can count on it. \n[6]One of the road crews just rolled into town. \n[7]Not these guys.

If you need anything. \n[13]Something wrong, boss? \n[14]That can't be. I had a man outside his room the whole time. \n[15]Boss, he could be anywhere. He... A battery. Didn't he say something about a battery? \n[16]He killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once.

I think he's made that plain. \n[18]If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, I need to know it's gonna be worth it. I need to know what's so special about this goddamn book. \n[19]Boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. You're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line? \n[20]And what if this book don't work? What if it don't say what you want it to say? \n[21]He has half a day on us already. \n[22]There ain't much gas in reserve. \n[23]The book.

Built up quite the stash over the years. \n[8]You know how to fire a gun? \n[9]Just like riding a bike. \n[10]How about you, you know how to- \n[11]Never mind. \n[12]What about us? \n[13]Martha? Martha! ", "YOUNG WOMAN": "\n[1]Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it. \n[2]That's what the last guys said. \n[3]Could you help me? The wheel came off.

They never are. Ain't that right, old man? Open the fucking pack or die. \n[5]Want us to do it for you? We can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off. \n[6]What the hell are you, some kinda preacher? \n[7]Well I got news for you, preacher man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. He ain't here to protect your ass.
