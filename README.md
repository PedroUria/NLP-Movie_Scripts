Budget data is not going to be [very reliable](https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/16774/is-there-a-way-to-find-out-about-movie-tv-budgets)...

Still, with [these numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all) we can tell which movie succeeded and which movie didn't succeed, and the probability of being wrong is very low. However, the ROI we would get from the above source (or any source) is most likely [unrealistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting).
